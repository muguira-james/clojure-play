Basically follows DIS sizes.Proposed changes to OMT should make data structure definition moreclear.RPR-FOM Interaction StructureMapping from DIS to the RPR-FOMSummary Questions:Interoperability Tests at FOM level similar to DIS?		Answer: Federates may exist that provide new attributesbut can still interoperate.  However, the "shall's" from the GRIM shouldprovide a mode for interoperatiblity testing. Possibly a Testingdocuments should be considered as a part of the RPR-FOM effort.Currently the RPR-FOM group lacks the manpower to drive this effort.  Weare currently in the phase of establishing the rules. These rules needto be evaluated by the community. Then the processes of how the rulesshould be tested can be defined. As HLA SDG establishes testingprocedures, the RPR-FOM group can leapfrog on those processes.Was HLA MOM used for Simulation Management?		Answer: The RPR-FOM Simulation Manager covers adifferent aspect of simulation. MOM covers federate level... RPR-FOMcovers simulation components.What about MOM compatibility?		Answer: Still transition to address MOM impact. However,MOM is orthogonal to RPR-FOM SIMAN issues. SIMAN is related to managingsimulation management objects.How close do we track HLA SDG?		Answer: Will be covered in HLA SDG issues discussionRequest to put change bars in next release of GRIM.When will next draft be released?		Answer: GRIM should follow the RPR-FOM within a fewweeks. Due on the 11th of November.		GRIM will be put on web and allow SDG web basedcommenting process.Action (Doug): Put GRIM 0.5 on RPR FOM document library.RPR FOM will be added to OML - What is the impact of RPR -FOM to OMDD.		Answer: OMDD has harvested RPR-FOM and created mappingsbetween RPR-FOM and OMDD. Some issues still exist and need to beresolved.RPR-FOMGraham Shanks(See RPR-FOM Draft presentation for more details)Configuration Management		Overview of CR web pageRPR-FOM Release		Action (Graham): Put RPR FOM release onto OML.Version 0.4 & 0.5RTI 1.3 - Object names & handlesTimestamp (no slide)		DIS has a timestamp field for which the data is valid.It can be used to extrapolate the data to receive time.		Current RTI does not support timestamp without timemanagement services.		RPR -FOM solution is to put the DIS timestamp in theuser defined tag as a character string of the hexadecimal representationof the 32 bit field.		Question: Is the timestamp taken out of the objectclass?		Answer: Problems with that approach dealing with atomicdelivery in DDM and transport types (more detail in interim meetingmeetings). Originally time field of update attribute was passed, in 1.3it stopped being passed along.Version 0.6		Enumerated data names conventions: size is put intoenumeration name.SCR 20 - Base Entity Class DefinitionSCR 21 - Civil & Military v0.3Civil & Military Hierarchy - v0.4Version 0.6 Issues		EmitterBeam is not a leaf node, but should bepublishable (there are beams that are not track/jam beam).				Solutions: empty subclass that is not atrack jam beam; empty subclasses that mirror beam functions.				Motion (Keith): Accept Graham's fix topublish 0.6 that works. Solutions beyond this fix is put up fordiscussion.				Second (Doug):				23 agree, 2 opposed				Action (Doug): Post this motion toreflector.		Encoding type is 14 bits				Solution is to increase size to 32 bits.Version 0.7 To Do List		Complete dummy enumerations		Entity type enumerations strategy				Flat enumerations				use of unions				just don't bother				tuples of integersEntity Type Enumerations as Union		Possible to massage DIS enumeration document to beparseable to create enumerations		Possible to use OMD tools to merge enumeration FOM partwith core RPR FOM part.Action (Graham): Investigate merging capabilityVersion 2.0 Kick-offHLA SDG Liaison IssuesKeith Briggs(See RPR-FOM HLA Interchange presentation for more details)Identified Issues		Not on slide:				Requestable objects				Globally unique IDsOMT Format Changes		enumeration sizes, 0+, variant records addressed inthese changesTime		Accepted issue and corrected problemRouting of Attributes		approved workgroup to review issuesAtomic delivery across objects		rejected this requestSet Attribute Value Request		rejected		Data logging would be easier		Action (Randy): Post the issue on RPR FOM reflectorRTI subsets		approved removal of compliance statement from I/FspecificationConfiguration Management		Tools do not support current approved changes to IEEEdraftCommercial vendors may be able to react to changes faster than RTI;however, previous changes have not been as sweeping as the introductionof comprehensive data typing tables.OMT changes presentations by David SiedelConclusionRichard Schaffer(See RPR-FOM Overview presentation for more details)Next Teleconference:		Needed by late October or very early November		Propose: Thursday, October 29Next Meeting		Attempt to coincide with HLA SDG		Location: San Diego, SAIC (Kathryn Morse), AlternativeRaytheon		Date: Jan 7&8Volunteers for AR positionsVolunteers for Version 2.0 sectionsIEEE 12781.a		Can be purchasedIEEE 12781.a: Entity, Distributed Emissions, Radio, ...- Volunteers?Entity Information/interactions:	?Distributed Emissions:	Graham ShanksRadio:	Gary WarrenEntity Management:	?Minefield:	Keith BriggsNon-Real Time:	?SIMAN with reliably:	?Synthetic Environment:	Doug WoodLive Entity:	?		Action (Richard): Contact Live Entity Forum=======================================================Douglas D.
