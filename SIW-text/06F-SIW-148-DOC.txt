Name of Forum or Group:  Research, Development, and Engineering (RDE)ChairCynthia BallardVice ChairDoug WoodSecretaryJohn FayObjectives for this Workshop:Concentrate Focus on User Community Research and Engineering.Focus Panel on Human Behavior Representation (HBR) workshop topic.Lengthen high interest paper presentation with added panel discussion.Promote Joint Sessions to reduce Paper Presentations.Brief all pertinent information (Agenda Format, Elections- New Members, Spring SIW Theme and Format) and meet F2F with PRP Members to kick-off the day.Comments and Recommendations:Involve RDE User Community via reflector for Call for Papers to focus abstracts.Continue to post all accepted paper abstracts on reflector.Continue to publish schedule for PRP members for abstract and paper review.Send thank you letters for TENA Panel (Jim Hollenbach, Katherine Morse) and HBR Panel (Sheila Banks, Mike Garrambone, Walter Warrick, and moderator, Tom Hughes).Recommend User Community to support HBR Study Group for set of modeling characteristics standards.  HBR Panel discussions lead to realization that community lacks repository of HBR.  Several questions were left unanswered.  Who is the governing body for HBR standards or should there even be a governing body for innovative HBR?  Who would VV&A HBR?  A repository of tested Use Cases is needed for this community.  Tom Hughes from General Dynamics has graciously agreed to chair this study group.Joint session with CFI was very successful.  Joint sessions with ANL and T&E had little boost in numbers impact.Recommend an interoperability study to answer questions posed in the TENA Panel discussion (see Katherine Morse presentation).  This study could feed into the Interoperability/Infrastructure study cited by Jim Hollenbach (see Jim Hollenbach presentation).  Where is the investment/community direction for interoperability (HLA, TENA, RTI, etc.) infrastructure?  What impact is the RDE having – if any – on shaping the interoperability infrastructure discussion in SISO, to steer PDG’s, or impact on the User Community?Three 2006 SIWzies presented in RDE (009,024,107).Noticeable decline in attendance after afternoon break.RDE PRP feels that the large draw to the Norfolk area in Spring 2007 will accommodate panel for Spring Agenda.Cybernet Systems Corporation offered to provided a briefing at the next SIW on Joint Architecture for Unmanned Systems standards from JAUS WG.Recommend that Interoperability/Infrastructure Panel (formerly known as TENA Panel) discussions continue at the Spring SIW.  Action taken by RDE PRP.Recommend a study group into the status of federate testing.  Given the automated processes available, what is the status of compliance testing wrt interoperability?Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)27Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)45Peak attendance (including joint sessions)85Total papers presented7“No-show” presentations0Other presentations and panel discussions2 PanelsRecommended Reading List nomination: SIWZIE Nominee(s):  Paper #:  06F-SIW-009                 2006 FALL SIW OUTBRIEF FORM
