Name of Forum or Group:  ChairWilliam BeavinVice ChairPer GustavssonSecretaryObjectives for this Workshop:The Crisis Management and Societal Security (CMSS) forum focuses on simulation interoperability issues related to the ISO TC 233 Societal Security Standardizing Organization and other related organizations.Comments and Recommendations:Joint forum with Training worked very well since training is a big component of CMSS.Recommendations:1. Consider forming a study group to look onto the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM) as the basis for a FOM/BOM.2. Renew efforts to solicit papers, encourage authors to consider CMSS applicability when writing “mainstream” papers.3. Joint forum with TRAIN worked very well.  CMSS may be a good example of a “virtual forum” that spans many other forums.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)16Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)22Peak attendance (including joint sessions)30Total papers presented5“No-show” presentations1Other presentations and panel discussions0Recommended Reading List nomination: 09S-SIW-65, 09S-SIW-57               2009 SPRING - OUTBRIEF
