Name of Forum or Group:  C2- M&S ServicesChairJohn DalyVice ChairAndreas TolkSecretaryTom MullinsObjectives for this Workshop:To attract papers and a discussion on:-   C2 ontology efforts and the applicability to simulations and interoperability between them.-   C2 capabilities that harness simulation technology for  operational use. -   Ongoing C2/M&S efforts  that support current operations.Comments and Recommendations: The number of papers submitted was disappointing. We had about 30% less than the last SISO in Orlando.   The discussions in the forum, and papers presented were very good, and it was a productive forum, but some of our objectives were not realized due to a low number of papers submitted.Recommendations:1. SISO make a more concerted effort to attract papers and attendance, especially in Newport, RI.2. We modify the Call for papers and outreach to:- Emphasize more applications (decision support, visualization, initialization, etc.) in C2 that use simulation, and try to attract interest in C2 developers, especially the U.S. FCS (Future Combat Systems) and NECC (Net Enabled Command and Control) programs.-  Try to attract more interest in C2 delivered simulation-based embedded and distributed training.-   Try to attract more interest in operational Architecture-based simulation initialization for use with C2 systems.- focus on M&S specific standardization necessities to enable net-centric use of M&S services (metadata for assumptions, constraints, and meaning)3.  That SISO consider  outreach  (possibly a keynote speaker) to the U.S. DoDAF community, for a more integrated approach to revisions of the DoDAF that will help DoDAF architectural artifacts become executable, or harness-able as a simulation initialization tool.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)41Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)72Peak attendance (including joint sessions)72Total papers presented15“No-show” presentations0Other presentations and panel discussions0Recommended Reading List nomination: 07F-SIW-54 07F-SIW-111 07F-SIW-106                 2007 FALL SIW OUTBRIEF FORM
