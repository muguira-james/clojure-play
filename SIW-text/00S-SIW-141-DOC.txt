IntroductionThe High Level Architecture (HLA) for Modeling and Simulation (M&S) is a network communication architecture designed to provide a mechanism for heterogeneous simulations to coordinate their run-time execution [1]. The creation of coordinated executions is designed to save money by allowing specialized resources (e.g. airplane simulators, custom computer hardware, live platform interfaces) to be shared by multiple programs. However, because the HLA has only recently been developed support for real-time simulationsas the DooD Distributed Simulation standard, information on the applicability of this standard to Navy M&S problems should be tested in real-world applications. This paper presents performance characteristics of the HLA Run-Time Infrastructure (RTI) in supporting a Navy application. RTI is the backbone of the High Level Architecture, through which information is passed from one system to another. The RTI has components intended to support widely disparate simulation systems. Unlike the Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) protocols, the RTI is not limited to the independentusing broadcast of state updates by each simulation to the distributed system in order to best use the bandwidth capacity. Instead, sSimulations subscribe to the RTI for specific services and likewise announce their intent to publish specific types of information. Thus, simulations become clients for some types of information, or servers of information, or both. This “client/server paradigm” is a radical departure from the structure of DIS-based simulation systems and will have an impact on the simulations using the paradigm.It is not clear how the RTI will actually perform in the presence of multiple services contending for available communications bandwidth. Naval system simulations will require dynamic information that is likely to be available only from powerful, dedicated server systems. Examples include environmental services such as volumetric, atmospheric, and oceanic data, long range or shallow water acoustic computations, electro-optic sensor computations, voice and digital communications network performance, and complex Command and Control and Decision Support systems.In order to evaluate the performance characteristics of RTI, an existing simulation was upgraded to use RTI to test the performance. The application is a real-time virtual reality application that simulates a Sship Combat Information Center (CIC). In this application the events will have to be communicated to each participant with minimum latency and the tactical picture consistency must be maintained. RTI’s ownership management services play a vital role for achieving this goal and should be performed by RTI effectively. Therefore this application was used to evaluate RTI capabilities in supporting real time applications as well as ownership handoff performance. We describe the Virtual Ship CIC application in the next section.2. Virtual CICAs the US defense budget decreases, the US Navy training community is more cost conscious than ever. In current US shore-based surface combatant training facilities, new crews are trained using real combat consoles in a classroom environment. This has the considerable expense of supporting, maintaining, and reconfiguring the consoles used in these facilities. In addition, there are a limited number of training consoles available, limiting time available to each student to use. Virtual reality technology has become a cost-effective training solution with the advent of more powerful and cheaper graphics computers. This technology allows the user to be immersed into a simulated graphical environment where he or she sees the virtual environment through a computer monitor or a head mounted display and provides input through various devices such as a keyboard, mouse or more sophisticated alternatives. We coupled virtual reality and distributed simulation technology to develop a distributed Vvvirtual Ssship Combat Information Center (CIC) for the surface ship training. The goal is to create a distributed, immersive learning environment to complement current training capability, with reduced maintenance cost and higher availability. CIC crewmembers can then perform team learning and training in a virtual ship environment. The virtual environment offers a true interactive 3D view of the interior of the CIC as shown in Figure 2.1. Figure 2.1: Virtual Ship Combat Information CenterThe visual simulation portion of the Virtual CIC is intended to provide the “look and feel” of the actual CIC through the use of extensive 3D models, phototextures, and sound clips. Virtual environments create a new level of training by making the training experience “realistic” instead of a classroom-like environment. It also simulates the equipment that the crew interacts with to perform detection, classification and target engagement activities. Each student appears in the environment as a 3D human representation, an avatar. A picture of each student’s face is scanned and texture mapped onto his avatar with the 3D texture mapping technique so that each student can recognize the others inside the Virtual CIC. The Virtual CIC’s networking capability allows students at different geographical locations to train together in a unified virtual environment over a wide area network. This networking capability not only allows the crews in the same ship CIC to be distributed at different locations for training, it also provides the capability to simulate the whole virtual battle group operations (multiple ships) as shown in Figure 2.2. Figure 2.1: Virtual Ship Combat Information CenterFigure 2.2: Virtual Battle GroupFigure 2.3: Holocube Visualization AidVarious information visualization aids were incorporated into the virtual environment to help students in learning different tactical deployment of the combat systems. For example, we have created a “holocube” that allows the student to visualize the entire battlespace as shown in Figure 2.3(Note: Suggest move the picture after the text). This allows students to correlate sensor data with a visual 3D display of a god’s-eye view, facilitating understanding of sensor capabilities and operations. This holographic-like display could also allow for visualization of sensor coverage, emission restrictions, operational boundaries and other doctrinal concepts and entities. As the student changes his watchstation console mode the holocube view could change to reflect the performance of that mode. This visual augmentation can assist teaching tactical deployment of offensive and defensive capabilities to incoming sailors. A multimedia hypertext tutorial is integrated into the virtual world detailing information about console operations, responsibilities, and workflow of watchstations in the CIC. The Virtual CIC application can be run in a variety of display and input configurations, including a simple single monitor with mouse and keyboard input for individual training, stereoscopic large multi-screen panoramic displays for group viewing or playback, and stereoscopic head mounted displays with hand and body movement tracking devices for fully immersive team training in order to meet different training needs.Figure 2.3: Holocube Visualization AidThe Virtual CIC application can be run in a variety of display and input configurations, including a simple single monitor with mouse and keyboard input for individual training, stereoscopic large multi-screen panoramic displays for group viewing or playback, and stereoscopic head mounted displays with hand and body movement tracking devices for fully immersive team training in order to meet different training needs.Virtual consoles are easily reconfigured or rearranged as needed for different ship configurations for maximum efficiency. By combining the virtual environment with a ship simulation model, operational procedures under various tactical scenarios can be explored and refined easily. System performance can be stressed in a realistic scenario without the risking accidents or tying up the real operational hardware. Incorporated information visualization aids allowed students to learn and understand the operations much faster than in a regular classroom environment. Virtual reality based training also allows students to train with advanced systems before the hardware has been built, or try out new physical layouts that do not currently exist, as well as experiment with and develop new operational procedures. The system described can be applied to land-based or mobile command centers as well as the ship CIC. Also, it is not limited to training applications. Currently, we are extending the system for conducting virtual prototyping (i.e., design and develop new systems in a virtual environment before building the real physical system). 3. Virtual CIC with RTIThis section presents the software development process and the test procedure used in embedding RTI v.1.3r6 into Virtual CIC. Prior to any development, the test team contacted and collaborated with personnel from the Joint Advanced Distributed Simulation (JADS) Joint Test & Evaluation (JT&S) Office and benefited from their experience [2]. The JADS group has developed several HLA test software tools for their work, including tools to log RTI activity, that was were applicable to this study also. The complete line of software tools can be downloaded from the JADS World Wide Web site [3]. Following sections present the experiences in adapting RTI version 1.3r6 as the network communication tool for the Virtual CIC.3.1 Design the FOM and SOMNetwork communication requirements were relatively clear from the existing implementation of the Virtual CIC. The Virtual CIC communication was based on passing data between CICs using generic strings, which were then parsed by each application and interpreted appropriately. This communication scheme could be very easily replaced by RTI interactions where the string would be passed as the parameter to an interaction. This, however, would make Virtual CIC federation a closed system. Another application would not be able decipher the meaning of those strings without access to Virtual CIC source code or specifications of the message strings.Therefore, it was more desirable to design the Federation Object Model (FOM) and Simulation Object Model (SOM) with the idea that a foreign, yet non-existent, system would want to participate in the Virtual CIC environment, publish and subscribe data as appropriate. To that end, the events in the Virtual CIC are definedbroadcast as appropriate RTI interactions, e.g. touch, move. 3.2 RTI-Virtual CIC InterfaceThe Virtual CIC application is written using a well-structured, object-oriented VR Framework. A framework is a library of classes that embodies an object-oriented abstract design to solve a set of similar problems. Libraries typically provide algorithms, e.g. trigonometric functions in the math libraries. Frameworks, on the other hand, provide or sometimes enforce structure to an application in addition to algorithms. The VR Framework provides classes that handle communication between framework applications based on UDP. These classes use eventsUDP protocol internally and hide the implementation of that protocol from the VR developer. Similarly, classes that use RTI as the communication protocol had to be added to the VR Framework. Then, Virtual CIC would require minimal changes to take of advantage of these new capabilities. System design was carried out with this vision. The basic design of the system is such that there is a single external data distriubution manager objectpoint of entry forto using the RTI services from the Virtual CIC. This is illustrated in Figure 3.1 with a Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagram [4].The blocks in UML diagrams represent classes with class names written in the top section of the block. When the name is printed in Italics, the class is said to be abstract. Abstract classes typically define interfaces. The lines connecting classes identify associations and the label on the line is the name of the association. The labels next to the class names, if they exist, identify the role of the class in the association. ExtDataDistMgr is the only class Virtual CIC knows and deals with to communicate with the rest of the world whether that is another Virtual CIC program or any federate using the same Federation Object Model (FOM). Conversely, ExtDataDistMgr only knows of one instance of the CicCallback class—a class derived from CicCallback to be perfectly accurate since abstract classes can not be instantiated. The numbers “1” at both ends of the association indicate that the relation is one-to-one. A more detailed description of the interface design is shown in Figure 3.2, including the methods defined by the interface classes.Figure 3.1: UML class diagram for the VCIC interfaceFigure 3.21: UML cClass diagram for the Virtual CIC and RTI RTI moduleinterface3.3 Network ArchitectureIn order to isolate the computers from excess network traffic that may alter the results, they are placed in a  a separate, stand-alone network. The network architecture used in the testing is shown in Figure 3.3 2 along with the computers used in testing. (The gray-shaded computers were not used in the testing but are shown in the diagram for completeness ( Note: need to explain why not used!!).) The numbers printed above the connections in the diagram represent whether the connection is active or not. This notation is used to avoid duplicating the image several times. The numbers indicate when the connection would be live with respect to the number of federates participating in the federation. For example, when a federation with two federates is being tested, Seahawk and Falcon would be connected to the hub and there would be no other connection to the hub. Similarly, when three federates are being tested connections labeled “2+” and “3+” would be active, creating a standalone network of three computers connected through a 10BaseT hub. In the case of seven or more federates participating in the federation, the network becomes connected to the rest of the LAN and Internet but the effect of this proved to be negligible.Clearly, performance results that we would measure during testing would depend on computer hardware characteristics, among other things. In other words, the faster the computer, the faster the RTI performance will be. This is because RTI is a software component that shares the resources of the host computer. In addition, the faster the computer can accomplish its simulation tasks, the faster or the more frequently it can give RTI a chance to perform the necessary tasks. Because of this consideration, it was desirable to use identical or very similar computers in the federation. Therefore, the first four federates ran on identical hardware. Later, faster computers were also added to the federation. Virtual CIC is a virtual reality application that requires high-performance computers whichthat provide high frame rate to give the user a realistic immersive environment. Therefore, any computer less powerful than an SGI Indigo2 was not used in the testing. EMBED Visio.Drawing.4  Figure 3.23: Test network configuration3.4 RTI Interface ModuleVirtual CIC simulations run in a distributed environment where multiple crewmembers (users) share the same virtual environment. It is important to maintain thea same consistent view of the virtual environment so as to not confuse the usersimmersive picture among each federate. Otherwise, it is easy to confuse users if the immersive world is not the same. Ownership handoff will be important capability to archieve this goal. There are cases when this environment can confuse the users. For example, if two crewmembers press the same button at the same time to turn the radar on, they may see that the radar did not come on at all. This is because there was two button push events generated, and the first turned the radar on, the second turned it off. To avoid this kind of behavior, resources can be allocated to particular users at particular times. Before pushing a button, the software (transparent to the user) requests ownership of that button from the federation. If the federation grants the ownership, the user would be allowed to push that button. Otherwise, it would get audio or visual feedback that he or she is not allowed to push that button. This way, two crewmembers could not push the same button at the same time. Therefore, seamless exchange of ownership from federate to federate (or user to user) makes the Virtual CIC more user friendly. It was desirable to achieve the ownership exchange under 500 milliseconds to make the Virtual CIC experience more pleasant.RTI provides three mechanisms to exchange ownership between federates [5]. These three mechanisms are shown as a UML sequence diagram in Figures 3.43–3.65. In these diagrams, RTI represent the RTI services offered by the Local RTI Component (LRC) and the Green or Yellow federate is any generic federate using these services.Figure 3.43: Ownership Pull (intrusive)Figure 3.54.: Ownership PushFigure 3.56: Ownership Pull (orphaned attributes)The first scheme shown in Figure 3.4 3 involves green federate asking ownership of one or more attributes of an object from RTI. RTI, in turn, will call one of yellow federate’s callback functions (assuming that the yellow federate owns those attributes in this example). Yellow federate then lets RTI know which of those attributes it is willing to give up. Then, RTI informs the green federate about for which attributes it has received the ownership. This scheme is very close to what was needed for Virtual CIC application. However, RTI implementation is limited in that if the yellow federate is not willing to give up ownership on any of the requested attributes, it has no way of informing the green federate of its decision. We tried using the attributeOwnershipReleaseResponse function with an empty list of attributes, which normally would contain the list of attributes the yellow federate was giving up, but that call had no effect. In other words, it did not cause RTI to call the green federate’s callback function attributeOwnershipAcquisitionNotification with an empty list of attributes. This is because RTI implementation “optimized out” the call, i.e. ignored it assuming that it has no consequence. This behavior was classified as normal or expected by the RTI Help Desk. The consequence of all of this is that green federate is never going to receive feedback about the request it made when yellow federate decides not to release any of the attributes. RTI developers asserted that this is in line with the HLA Interface Specification (I/F Spec) [6]. This assertion may be debated however as the I/F Spec is wide open for interpretation on this issue:“The AttributeOwnershipReleaseResponse service shall notify the RTI that the federate is willing to release ownership of the specified instance attributes for the specified object instance. The federate shall use this service to provide an answer to the question posed as a result of the RTI invocation of RequestAttributeOwnershipRelease. The returned argument shall indicate the instance attributes for which ownership was actually released. Completing of the invocation of this service shall be viewed as an implied AttributeOwnershipDivestitureNotification invocation for all of the instance attributes in the returned argument.”                                 —HLA Interface SpecificationAs underlined above (not underlined in the original document), the I/F Spec requires that the attributeOwnershipReleaseResponse shall be used to respond to ownership requests. However, in the current implementation of the RTI this service can not be used to answer the request when the answer is “I do not want to give up the ownership of any of the requested attributes.”  Therefore according to this interpretation it can be argued that RTI does not perform as prescribed by the I/F Spec.One way to get around this deficiency in the RTI behavior is to implement a time-out procedure. If a federate does not hear a response to its ownership request within a “reasonable” amount of time, it should assume that the request was denied. This time-out threshold depends on what kind of latency is expected in the network. It can be calculated by adding the maximum expected delay between two nodes and an additional duration to account for unusual behavior on the network. For Virtual CIC, this time-out value is set to 500 milliseconds, as this was our maximum response time requirement. The other two ownership exchange schemes that were not needed in Virtual CIC but could be used in other applications are shown in Figures 3.5 4 and 3.65. Figure  3.5 4 shows how a federate can divest its ownership of one or more attributes. (There is also an unconditional divestiture method that is very similar to what’s shown in the figure.)  Figure 3.6 5 illustrates the procedure to retrieve ownership for attributes that are available. These attributes may be ones that were released by previous federates without properly transferring the ownership to another federate. In such cases, RTI maintains the ownership for the attributes. One desirable but missing functionality identified in the RTI was the capability to request ownership for the object as a whole instead of a set of its attributes. Owning an object as a whole can be considered owning all its attributes. As such, requesting all the attributes of an object is the same as requesting the ownership for the object and RTI provides this functionality. This works well when only one federate requests ownership of all the attributes at any given time. However, if two or more federates request ownership of all the attributes of an object at about the same time, each federate may get a subset only. In other words, there is a chance none of the federates will own the object as a whole. This issue is also addressed by Kuijpers, et al [7]. In Virtual CIC application, this “fight for all attributes” was avoided by choosing one attribute to represent ownership of an object in the federation. This could be an attribute defined in the FOM for this purpose specifically. Instead, it was decided to use the privilegeToDelete attribute already defined for all attributes by the RTI. 3.5  Ownership Exchange Performance Test ResultsInitially, the testing involved two identical SGI Indigo2 computers.  The participants walked over to a console in the virtual world and pressed each button and saw the effect.  If the other person owned the button at the time, nothing happened.  Otherwise, the radar may have been turned on, or the scale on the radar screen may have been changed depending on what button was pushed.  During this process, it was observed whether there was a consistent picture for both participants.  In other words, if the radar appeared on for one user, it was on for the other also.  Maintaining tactical picture consistency was one of the requirements and RTI fulfilled this requirement using reliable communication mode.It was expected that as the number of federates increase, the ownership request response time would increase.  To some extent, this prediction was true as shown in Figure 3.76. The figure shows a scatter plot of ownership exchange response time where the legend shows the name of the computer where the federate was running.  Ownership exchange response time here is defined as the time from the point the user pushes a button and causes an ownership request to the time he or she gets a response from the federation.  Considering the fact that RTI is single-threaded, in other words, does not function while program control is not explicitly given to it, the response time includes not only the RTI performance but also the Virtual CIC performance characteristics such as rendering speed.  In fact, this is what makes measured response times depend on the computer platform.  Since RTI does not run as a separate thread in an application, it has to be given CPU cycles as frequently as the data must be exchanged.  This is achieved by calling the RTI tick() function.  Virtual CIC gave RTI ample opportunity to perform its tasks by calling the tick function between rendering of each frame so that communication between the federates would not be hindered. Figure 3.8 7 shows the average response time for ownership requests as the number of federates in the federation increase.  The first four federates that participated on this testing procedure was running on four identical SGI Indogo2 computers with Maximum Impact graphics board and a 250 MHz IP22 processor (Seahawk, Falcon, Blackhawk and Stennis in Figure  3.77).  The fifth federate ran on another SGI Indogo2 computer with a High Impact graphics board and a 195 MHz IP28 processor (America in Figure  3.7).  The next three additions to the federation were even faster computers, which explains the reduction in average response time. Table 3.1 shows a summary of the computer hardware used in testing. EMBED Word.Picture.8  Figure 3.76: Ownership exchange response times EMBED Word.Picture.8  Figure 3.87: Average ownership exchange response timeTable 3.1: SGI hardware that was used to run Virtual CICComputer NameSGI ModelNumber and type of Processor (CPU)Graphics boardMemory (Mbyte)Network InterfaceSeahawkIndigo21 x 250MHz IP22MIPS R4400Maximim Impact256EthernetFalconIndigo21 x 250MHz MIPS R4400IP22Maximum Impact256EthernetBlackhawkIndigo21 x 250MHz MIPS R4400IP22Maximum Impact256EthernetStennisIndigo21 x 250MHz MIPS R4400IP22Maximum Impact256EthernetAmericaIndigo21 x 195MHz IP28MIPS R10000High Impact256EthernetHopperOctane2 x 195MHz IP30MIPS R10000MXI128Fast EthernetRamageOctane1 x 195MHz IP30MIPS R10000MXI256Fast EthernetVinsonOnyx24 x 194MHz IP25MIPS R10000InfiniteReality512EthernetThe performance on a WAN is also measured.  Assuming that two federates are spread across the country, the additional time required to transfer data back and forth is approximately 60 milliseconds.  (For example, roundtrip transfer of 50-to-1000 bytes of data between Washington, D.C. and Mountain View, CA takes 60-to-65 milliseconds.)  To achieve the effect of a cross-country WAN between two federates, they are connected through two routers and a 30-millisecond delay is introduced to each packet during the transmission between the routers.  With this configuration, the average response time was measured as 270 milliseconds.  This is acceptable as it is well below our 500-millisecond acceptable limit.  The only concern though, is that the RTI's failure to provide negative feedback on ownership requests.  When running a federation on a WAN, the time-out technique described earlier may be hazardous as some requests can take too long to be responded as the network temporarily becomes unavailable, which is certainly more likely on a WAN than a LAN.  Therefore time-out period would have to be kept long.  This period may have to be too long to account for low quality connections, and may deem running of the federation on a WAN impractical. 4. DiscussionsThe performance levels obtained using RTI for network communication instead of UDP in Virtual CIC application was acceptable.  Most of the CPU time spent from the time ownership request was made until the request response was received was spent by the Virtual CIC application.  It was measured that the time RTI takes to respond to ownership requests was about 15 milliseconds, compared to an average of 200 millisecond response time for the user to know whether he or she gets the ownership to an entity.  Therefore, RTI would perform well within acceptable levels for this task even for more federates than tested.  A response time of 500 milliseconds is considered acceptable for most Virtual CIC users.The experience in developing an HLA compliant application using the RTI libraries developed by DMSO was relatively painless.  The Application Program Interface (API) that was provided by the RTI library was sufficient in general.  However we did experience difficulty in a couple of areas.Firstly, there are three schemes provided by RTI to exchange ownership. According to one of the three schemes, a federate can request ownership for a set of attributes.  The federate owning those attributes gets a callback from RTI to release them.  When that federate responds to RTI by listing all the attributes it is willing to release, RTI lets the requesting federate what it is allowed to own.  The problem is that even when the federate that owned the attributes know for sure that it is not willing to give up the ownership to any of these attributes, there is no way it can respond to the request as such.  The consequence of this is that the requesting federate never hears anything from the RTI whether it will get the ownership for those attributes or not.  This can easily be fixed by letting the owning federate to respond to RTI by giving an empty list of attributes as the attributes the requesting federate can own.Second difficulty experienced in using RTI was that the part of the RTI code needed for interfacing with Virtual CIC appeared to have interfered with other software libraries Virtual CIC was using. Even when none of the RTI services were being used, simply linking the RTI libraries into a very simple IRIS Performer (a commercial VR development tool from SGI) [8] application created system crashes in a reproducible manner when a system call is made from the the C++  application, e.g. to sound the system bell: system("sfplay bell.aiff").  This is certainly an unacceptable behavior. Without the source code for the local RTI component that the applications link with, it is virtually impossible to identify the source of the problem.  However, through the use of a debugger, it appears that IRIS Performer and RTI are using conflicting signals that causes the system to crash.  One possible reason for this to occur is that maybe RTI is using global data that gets initialized and in the process uses signals. It is not yet clear what the cause of such flaky behavior is. There is also a need for better documentation of RTI software.  For example, the “RTI.rid” file that comes with the RTI distribution contains a slew of parameters that can be modified to achieve different behavior, and possibly better or worse performance.  These parameters are not explained in any documentation.RTI distribution includes an electronic version of the programmer's manual in Adobe Acrobat® format [9].  This is very useful to programmers.  It would be even more useful however if the document included a hyperlinked index, so that navigation is faster and easier.5.
