Wednesday, 17 MarchMr. Joe Lacetera opened the C4ISR Track/C4I Forum, and announced the approval/formation an implementation study group (ISG) to determine where we need to go in terms of standards for C4I interoperability.Mr. Bill Sudnikovich, Chair of the C4I forum then took the floor briefly, and opened with various administrative topics, after which we began presenting papers.The forum was able to work-in two unscheduled, invited presentations of high interest, and used the remainder our available discussion time to work with Joe Lacetera in getting the ISG off the ground. Joe presented a briefing in each of the joint sessions in order to spread the word and encourage participation. A copy of Joeâ€™s briefing is attached. The morning session featured the following papers:99S-SIW-061 Implementation of a Prototype C4I FOM (Bill Sudnikovich, John Roberts)99S-SIW-035 Using Standard C4I Components to Interface to Simulations (Don Timian)99S-SIW-021 Simulation and Evaluation of Adaptive Mobile Large-Sale Network Systems (SEAMLESS) (Chris Heydemann)99S-SIW-170 Using the seamless Environment to Realistically Emulate Communications(Aaron Steigerwald, Adam Sulesky, Larry Longmin)99S-SIW-181 jwars Communications Modeling (James Jones)After lunch, the C4I forum met in joint session with the Sensor forum (SENS) to hear the following 2 papers:99S-SIW-203 An incremental approach to development of a c4isr analysis federation (Greg Roszyk)99S-S-SIW-034 Data Alignment Between Army C4I Databases and Army Simulations(Michael Heib)Following the afternoon break the following papers were presented:99S-SIW-068 Addressing the complexity of data-link interoperability (Phil Yanni - presented by Pat Martin)99S-SIW-102 RTI Performance in Sending High Volume Data: An Update (John Shockley)99S-SIW-046 Benchmarking the RTI for Simulated Radio Applications (David Nemeth)Thursday, 18 MarchThe morning session was a joint session with the staff level training (SLT) forum. The following papers of joint interest were presented:99S-SIW-212 The Fixed Tactical Internet: Integrating Live and Virtual C4I Systems (Tom Kelso)99S-SIW-134 Real Time Connectivity: A Simulation to C4I System Interface Tool (Larua Hinton)99S-SIW-162 Simulating the Army Tactical Command and Control System Using the Run Time Manager: Concepts and Implications (Richard Ressler)99S-SIW-138 Results of the DARPA Course of Action Analysis (COAA) Proof of Principle Pilot Test (Greg Schow)99S-SIW-194 Intelligence Cells in Large Scale Exercises (Gerry Frazier)99S-SIW-190 Modeling and Simulation in Support of the US Air Force Expeditionary Force Experiment(Scott Johnson)99S-SIW-C4I Common Shared Data Environment for C4ISR and Simulation Systems (Andreas Tolk & Stephan Krusche) (Invited presentation, draft of paper for fall 99 SIW)Before breaking for lunch, the forum discussed restructuring for the fall '99 workshop in order to enable more joint sessions, noting the high-level of common interest in many of the presented papers and the fact that numerous papers had to be presented several times. The final scheduled paper was presented after lunch:99S-SIW-087 An Embedded Real-Time HLA Application Case Study: Part 1 (Kirk Dunkelberger)The forum wound up with an invited presentation: Navy Communications Reference Federation Object Model Development (Drs Albert Legaspi & Dave Nikhil)A work session was held to gather conference key points, work the charter and tasks of the ISG, and do preliminary planning for a summer interim meeting. A reflector is available and anyone interested should subscribe to SIW-ISG-C4I.
