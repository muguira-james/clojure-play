The lab owes its heritage to the System Simulation and Development Division of AMRDEC.  SSDD is a leader within RDECOM for Distributed Simulation with large cells suitable for full size helicopter cockpits, and engineering level models for flight, movement, multi-spectral sensors, and rapid terrain database development of geospecific locations.  The WPL is a direct application of those strengths, which is of immense use to Homeland Security as well as Force Protection.  Over the last two years, the WPL has been using the tools and expertise we have in house and inviting participation from outside agencies to collaborate. The simulation network is linked to others via Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) protocols, which have been used by DoD and industry for over 10 years to facilitate distributed virtual battlespaces. The WPL has led in the translation of the simulation outputs to immersive environments where the soldier, sailor, or airman can concentrate on the “information” and not be burdened with the data.  The simulation results are presented as visual and auditory stimuli, which not only speeds the translation process, but creates something akin to the “Fog of War”.  You no doubt have seen Carrier simulators where personnel emerge from a training session with elevated heartbeats and perspiration, because of the realism of the environment.  Those within DoD know the benefit of “training as we fight, and fighting as we train”, and so should the domestic responder.  The result is a robust environment which supports informed decisions about techniques and/or technologies, such as in Analysis of Alternatives (AoAs), and is useful to DoD Force Protection, and Federal, State and Local agencies for Homeland Security.  For each application, metrics can be chosen to measure, track, and justify decisions.  Usefulness of the WPL has evolved into three primary areas.  These are support for exercises, optimization of sensor locations within an existing specific environment, and SOP and planning development/optimization.  The Warfighter Protection Lab uses simulation technology to convey Homeland Security data for appropriate response.1. IntroductionThe Warfighter Protection Lab (WPL) was established in 2002 and is a Force Protection and Homeland Security Test-Bed supporting Huntsville, Alabama Redstone Arsenal and the surrounding region.  It has partnered with and immersed in the Redstone Arsenal (RSA) Garrison to provide Force operational development, evaluation, experimentation and implementation.  The Warfighter Protection Lab builds on the historical mission of developing and implementing live, virtual, and constructive modeling and simulation.  Using three-dimensional computer-generated graphics, the WPL simulates a variety of scenarios to help people train to be successful in force protection or homeland security related incidents.  Since its inception, the WPL has expanded support to the Center for Domestic Preparedness (CDP) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) among other programs.  After a successful Joint Staff Integrated Vulnerability Assessment (JSIVA) validation of RSA, that role expanded to designing the Midwestern Regional Operations Center (MROC) at Rock Island Arsenal (RIA) and the AMC Field Support Command (AFSC).2. PartnershipsOver the last two years, the WPL has been using the tools and expertise available in house and inviting participation from outside agencies to collaborate.  We link our simulation network to other networks via Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) protocols, which have been used by DoD and industry for over 10 years to facilitate distributed virtual battlespaces.  The DIS protocols are an IEEE standard, and are ubiquitous across the DoD simulation community.  The Warfighter Protection Lab is partnered with many different groups allowing a wide range of capabilities and expertise.  The WPL has affiliations with corporations and departments such as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Center for Domestic Preparedness (CDP), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Alabama Department of Homeland Security, Fifth Army, University of Alabama-Huntsville (UAH), Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), Intergraph, Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC), and Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA).  The lab combines the simulation technology and equipment of Intergraph, SAIC, and UAH to meet the objectives of groups involved in homeland security exercises and scenarios.  As we have added partners, we have extended the DIS connectivity as appropriate, so that added tools are compatible with existing simulations.3. Simulation for PreparednessEmergency preparation is the main goal for the WPL and it is met primarily through research, design and simulation of hazardous situations.  The Warfighter Protection Lab is comprised of a group of simulation environments in which any number of scenarios can be played out. Each system offers value in a variety of circumstances and together they make up an advanced simulation test-bed used for preparation and planning response to hazardous events.    EMBED PowerPoint.Show.8  Figure 2.1   In house simulations include IDEEAS, MAK Stealth, I/CAD, XIG, Commander, DI-Guy, Traffic Server, and AT Planner.3.1 IDEEASThe backbone of the WPL simulation network is an in-house simulation tool which has evolved over a decade of use within the Army community for live, virtual, and constructive simulation tasks.  Interactive Distributed Engineering Evaluation and Analysis Simulation (IDEEAS) is a high-fidelity object oriented simulation environment with added capabilities for system configuration and scenario development developed by AMRDEC at Redstone Arsenal.  It is a driver simulation showing a bird’s eye view of entities on a map developed using legacy tools and investments and applies battlefield management technology to force protection situations.  IDEEAS is used to test existing security systems and facilities and help develop tactics, techniques, and procedures for force protection and emergency response. Figure 3.1 The IDEEAS terrain map allows WPL personnel to simulate and re-create potential terrorist attack scenarios. IDEEAS is the driving simulation for all models in the lab’s tool network.  It uses Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) protocols to allow it to interoperate with other simulators, and/or real hardware. The DIS protocols facilitate this by providing a common operating environment using an IEEE standard network protocol.3.2 MAK StealthMAK Stealth is a three dimensional visualization tool used for situation awareness, simulation debugging, or after–action–review.  Stealth is used out-of-the box from MAK Technologies and comes with a variety of features including entity display, trailing effects, trajectory histories, entity labels, billboard icons for unit identification, translucent bounding volumes to represent aggregates, dynamic sensor volumes, and a 2D overlay with an entity locator and position indicator. Picture-in-picture inset views allow you to see what any vehicle is seeing, even as you watch it travel across the terrain.  This allows real-time viewing of assets in a realistic environment, enhancing simulation realism. Using MAK Stealth, emergency personnel can plan and rehearse emergency plans and procedures for any type of terrorist attack or natural disaster through real-time visual and audio simulations.3.3 I/CADIntergraph’s Computer-Aided Dispatch system is used in over 160 agencies around the world.  I/CAD seamlessly integrates intelligent, real-time mapping with call handling, dispatching, records and information management, remote access, and mobile data.  It displays data in an easy-to-follow, user friendly environment that models real-world, everyday decision-making processes. I/CAD allows emergency dispatchers to realistically respond to stimulation from simulation. A security dispatcher uses I/CAD to receive, store, retrieve, analyze, and disseminate information about an emergency situation. The dispatcher can direct, manage, and track emergency personnel. The result is a streamlined process that allows call takers and handlers to locate, filter, and route calls for service more effectively, providing accurate and prompt first-level response. I/CAD has the capability to interact with other simulations on the DIS network.  It is unique and valuable in that aspect and allows the WPL to visualize and rehearses incidents with GIS integration through multiple simulations in order to gain knowledge and awareness about hazardous events.  While many garrisons have access to computer-aided dispatch tools, the WPL is the only lab with the ability to link real-world tactical tools to a distributed interactive simulation. These exercises help reduce emergency incident response times and enhance training opportunities for first responders.3.4 XIG Alion’s (formerly CATI) Cross Platform Image Generator (XI-G) simulates physics-based UAV and sensor models (i.e. forward looking infrared (FLIR), Day-TV and night vision goggle (NVG). In addition, XIG is also used as a simulation visualization tool in the Warfighter Protection Laboratory to view scenarios in a three-dimensional environment.  3.5 CommanderCommander is a situational awareness tool built on the Geospatial Information System (GIS) application developed by Intergraph known as GeoMedia.  This tool was originally used in Garrison exercises as a means to quickly zoom in on and examine the infrastructure layers of the military installation, but is so versatile that it has been expanded several times to include other critical information such as vehicle tracking, plume cloud distribution, dynamic building and vehicle gate status.  It has capabilities far beyond a viewer, allowing resource tracking, interfacing with the WPL simulation suite, and as a front end driver for the CDP Incident Command Course tool.  Commander offers a situational awareness view of a state, county or municipality encompassing threat analysis with specific GIS data.  It is a valuable tool for asset monitoring and data storage and provides an inclusive view of all collected information.3.6 DI-GuyDismounted Infantry Guy (DI-Guy) Scenario was developed by Boston Dynamics as an interactive, three-dimensional simulation depicting individuals and their behaviors.  DI-Guy Scenario’s advanced capabilities help the Warfighter Protection Lab manage a 3D environment with people entities. Users can program individuals or groups to respond to events and entities in the environment.  The life-like simulation environment in DI-Guy permits the user to define behavior of an individual or group by selecting a leader model for them to follow.   This feature saves time and resources, allowing the user to concentrate on the specifics of the incident while still maintaining the reality-based behavior of the entities involved.DI-Guy includes models and behavior for approximately 100 characters, including eight kinds of soldiers and an array of specialists- such as landing signal officers, plane captains, first responders equipped with gas masks and MOPP gear- and male and female civilians. DI-Guy uses industry standard Open Flight models, making it possible to add your own models to the library. An advanced motion engine makes the physical behavior of DI-Guy characters extremely lifelike. DI-Guy comes with over 2,000 motions and transitions in its library, and the ability to add your own motions to the library using the optional DI-Guy Motion Editor.The WPL employs DI-Guy to create scenarios and control the placement and behavior of characters in detailed urban environments; allowing emergency responders to train for situational scenarios outside of actual emergency events.3.7 Traffic ServerTraffic Server simulates a real-life situation of emergency vehicle response.  In most emergency response situations regular traffic congests the roadways and influences the path and speed of the emergency vehicle.  To accurately simulate an emergency scenario, background traffic must be included.  Previously IDEEAS had no way of displaying all these vehicles at once, but with the traffic server interface, the vehicles can be seen and controlled accurately within the simulation.The WPL uses the traffic server to display vehicles on road networks for simulation scenarios and control emergency response vehicle dispatching to and from incident locations.3.8 AT PlannerThe Anti-Terrorism (AT) Planner was developed by the U.S. Army Engineering and Research Development Center as a method of predicting structural damage and blast zones surrounding an improvised explosive device (IED).  AT Planner is a model for structural failure and destruction possibilities evaluated through information about size, type, and distance of the IED as well as information about the building structure including height, material, wall positioning and window location.  It can be run on a laptop computer to assess hazardous situations and ensure the safety and well-being of the general public as well as that of the first responders by providing information about proper standoff distances surrounding a suspect IED.  AT Planner has been used in various Force Protection exercises by the WPL.4. Simulation Testing ExercisesThe WPL not only uses simulations to plan for disasters, we also help first responders prepare for real emergency situations.  Our technology is available to first responders when they need it most.  The WPL is involved in the testing of responders and dispatchers through the simulation of unexpected occurrences of natural or terrorist events. Virtual maps, databases, modeling, and simulation tools are networked to conduct valid analysis with fewer hardware and human resources.  Our simulation capabilities are designed and modeled in the lab, but are intended for use on location during emergency situations.  Large scale training exercises are essential for preparedness in the event of a hazardous incident or terrorist attack.  The massive cost of such incidents makes them impossible to conduct on a regular basis and has left the defense community seeking affordable ways to gain valuable training for response to emergency situations.  The Warfighter Protection Laboratory has stepped in to answer the call through the use of computer simulation to provide support and training for these scenarios without expending valuable resources.4.1 Unmanned aerial vehicle use at the WPLThe Warfighter Protection Lab makes use of unmanned vehicles for data retrieval.  Our partnership with the University of Alabama in Huntsville allows us to make use of their UAV, nicknamed the Flying Bassett, equipped with chemical sensor abilities as well as live video feed.  The Flying Bassett is integrated with many of our tools in the field exercises and is an important component in response allowing prompt situational awareness for first responders and emergency decision makers.4.2 The WPL and the Center for Domestic           PreparednessThe United States Department of Homeland Security’s Center for Domestic Preparedness (CDP) recently turned to the simulation experts of the Warfighter Protection Lab to help them build a high-fidelity simulation-based training system that would retain the realistic, engineering-and physics-based integrity of U.S. Army simulations to enhance their three-day training program aimed at first responders in an Incident Command Post.SAIC led the lab in producing the CDP scenario.  With a combination of DI-Guy, Commander, and ALERTS (a scenario timeline manager), SAIC designed and created a model city to house the scenario.  Students in the program now spend the first four hours practicing incident response through virtual reality technology simulation.  As a result of these modernized simulated exercises, responders are learning how to understand the resource requirements for a mass casualty terrorist event and how to be proactive and diligent in event planning in their own communities.4.3 WPL and the OMEMS/FBI Hazardous Devices                  SchoolThe lab has partnered with FBI and TRADOC Ordnance, Munitions, and Electronics Maintenance School in a unique 200 acre facility known as the Hazardous Devices School (HDS) on the Redstone Arsenal used for training bomb disposal.  Since there are live explosives used in training, it is critical that the range safety office have awareness of where students and visitors are on the campus.  The campus is divided into zones, so different activities can be concurrently ongoing in each zone.The WPL applies Intergraph’s GPS and radio equipment to ensure the safety of students and visitors at the school and surrounding areas.  Tracking transceivers are issued to visitors so that they can be closely monitored.  The software allows the safety officers to view each vehicle as an on-screen icon and click to determine occupants and crew.  An alarm is programmed into the software to alert the safety officer in the event that a vehicle is moving too close to a hazardous area.Figure 4.2 An overhead view of the HDS along with 	    Intergraph’s Intelli-Where Trackforce 	     vehicle tracking software.5. The WPL as an Emergency Control CenterThe WPL is also involved in control and support during emergency situations.  Through partnership with the Joint Task Force (JTF) Fifth Army, members of the WPL were recently deployed to assist in the relief efforts following hurricanes Rita and Katrina.  In house products from the WPL were used to create situational awareness maps of flooded residential areas in an attempt to help save victims of hurricane Katrina.  The team used WPL GIS tools to plot data received from police checkpoints, helicopter flyovers, zip code areas and de-watering stations into maps used to brief top officials on current conditions in New Orleans and the surrounding area.  The data was in constant transition with data coming in from many different sources.  The expertise of the WPL allowed the organization and updating of the ever-changing situation in a timely manner.  Our maps were being used in briefings of head officials from every department including the president of the United States.Figure 5.1 The WPL’s Mike Melton using GIS data  	    to map relief efforts during hurricanes Rita                    and Katrina. During the preparation for hurricane Rita, the technology and capability of the Warfighter Protection Lab was again called upon to provide help in relief efforts and emergency management.  We prepared maps and housing information for the projected destruction areas.  The use of GIS data helped local officials become better prepared to face the destruction of hurricane Rita.The Warfighter Protection Lab also participates in exercises known as Vigilant Shield conducted through the Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and DoD in an effort to keep up with emerging technologies suited to aid in the support of disasters and emergency situations.6. The Warfighter Protection Lab SummaryThe Warfighter Protection Laboratory located on Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama is a state-of-the-art force protection simulation test-bed supporting Redstone Arsenal and the surrounding region.  The WPL uses computer simulation to prepare and train first responders for emergency response to hazardous incidents.  Through partnerships with Intergraph, SAIC, UAH, FBI, DTRA, SMDC, the Alabama Department of Homeland Security, and more, the WPL has become a major player in homeland defense scenarios and simulation.  We use in-house software as well as out-of the-box programs to develop intense scenarios geared toward threat response.The use of simulation is becoming more and more advanced and it is now possible to accurately represent real-life situations and human response with computers.  The WPL utilizes this technology in an effort to provide valuable training at a much lower cost.  Our technology assists the emergency responder at the scene and allows quicker, more accurate response to crisis.  Continually adapting to changing threats in the Global War on Terrorism, the WPL develops and tests technical solutions to integrate various existing data sources (such as alarms, video, audio, and sensors), existing and emerging dispatch systems, geographic information systems (GIS), plume modeling, infrastructure and building design data, and other sources of information. Once solutions are identified and tested, the WPL makes them available for eventual adoption by military installations, state emergency management agencies, airports, utilities, hospitals, or other infrastructure.The Warfighter Protection Lab serves as a fast-track security solution development center where government agencies can go to quickly plan and test solutions for specific installations and regions. Federal, state, and local government agencies now can work together to defend our homeland security empowered with the tools necessary to detect, respond to, and mitigate terrorist threats. Through computer simulation and robotics, agencies can safely assess the situation and devise a way to fight an attack, saving valuable time and lives. Author BiographiesDAN BELK is the Warfighter Protection Lab Manager of the Aviation Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center.
