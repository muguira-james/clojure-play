“SCORM – simulation interface standards”Call for POSITION PaPERSOne of the important challenges faced by designers and developers of learning, education and training technology is how to integrate simulation-based learning experiences with SCORM environments. This problem has many aspects, both pedagogical and technical. A clear first step is to enable SCORM content or Runtime Environments to communicate with simulations in a standardized and interoperable fashion. Such "SCORM-Simulation Interface Standards" will lower the cost of integration, lead to tools that save designers and developers time and money and help simulation vendors develop reusable simulations and components.In response, two IEEE standards committees, the Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization - Standards Activity Committee (SISO SAC < HYPERLINK "http://www.sisostds.org/" \o "http://www.sisostds.org/" http://www.sisostds.org/> ) and the Learning Technology Standards Committee (LTSC < HYPERLINK "http://ieeeltsc.org/" \o "http://ieeeltsc.org/" http://ieeeltsc.org/> ), are embarking on a joint project to investigate and produce standards for interfaces between SCORM-based systems and simulations.The first meeting will be held in conjunction with the AICC meeting in La Jolla, CA, February 2-3, 2006.  The second meeting will be held in conjunction with the Spring Simulation Interoperability Workshop in Huntsville, AL, April 2-9.  AICC meeting information - please check the AICC web site for updates  HYPERLINK "http://www.aicc.org/" \o "http://www.aicc.org/" <http://www.aicc.org/>.Interested organizations and individuals are invited to submit a position paper prior to January 20, 2006 to Geoff Frank (gaf@rti.org), Robby Robson (rrobson@eduworks.com) and Katherine L. Morse (morsek@saic.com).Position papers:Shall outline an overall architectural or system approach to integrating simulations into SCORM learning environments Shall briefly describe any documented and implemented solutions that the submitter could contribute to a standardization effort. May propose undocumented and unimplemented solutions Are encouraged to include references to literature that would benefit the standardization effort. Are not scholarly publications or white papers. The intent is to capture ideas and proposals, not to write a book. Should be brief. The clearer the better, but it is more important to get ideas down than to polish the presentation.
