Chair and Vice Chair were not able to attend.There was some confusion by workshop attendees on the agendaRecommendations: improve early broadcasting of draft agendas to all group coordinators.All chairs submitted proposed agendas should be carbon-copied by the Executive Director or his designee to the SISO-PRP-PVT (private) reflector.  An even better solution would be have a “draft agenda folder” available on the SIW papers web page that contains the latest draft agendas in one place.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)13.8Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)20Peak attendance (including joint sessions)31Total papers presented11“No-show” presentations1Other presentations and panel discussions0Recommended Reading List nomination: None.                 2007 SPRING SIW OUTBRIEF FORM
