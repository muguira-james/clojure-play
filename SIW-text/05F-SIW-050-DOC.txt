This requirement is levied through a Key Performance Parameter (KPP) called Embedded Training.  To help satisfy this requirement, the Training Common Component (TCC) program was established with Environmental Representation (ER) a key TCC.  The objective of the ER TCC is to provide a consistent and authoritative representation of operationally relevant environmental features and attributes for the complete TCC.The initial ER TCC requirements were derived from previous Army training and simulation programs including primarily WARSIM and the One Semi-Automated Forces (OneSAF) Objective System (OOS).  However, it was determined that WARSIM and OOS not meet the full range of requirements for the operational, mission planning and mission rehearsal communities the TCC would be required to train.  Thus, the Common Data Modeling Framework (CDMF) Environmental Data Models (EDMs) were employed to supply additional operationally relevant features and attributes that were of interest to the FCS embedded training TCC. The question was asked, “How do these detailed requirements relate to the overall FCS requirements?”  In order to answer this question, the ER were mapped to Military Functions (MF) that have operational relevance.  These MFs were derived from the OOS Environment Runtime Component (ERC) Military Functional Uses (MFU) developed originally to assist the software engineers in implementing OOS ER, thus the OOS ERC MFUs were at a physical level.  For FCS TCC, there was a need to abstract the MFUs to a logical level to support mapping into other program documents.  After the extended MFUs were derived, they were mapped into the FCS missions.  This mapping ensured that all TCC environmental features and attributes were operationally relevant.  This paper describes the effort to ensure all FCS Training IPT environmental requirements are operationally relevant and are fully linked to approved FCS program level documents.  By implementing this linkage, the Training IPT has established a pedigree for all its feature and attribute requirements as being both operational relevant and required by the FCS program.IntroductionThe Future Combat Systems (FCS) program is identifying the promising systems and technologies for achieving the Army's vision of fielding a "Future Force.” The Future Force is the Army's full spectrum force; organized, manned, equipped and trained to be more strategically responsive, deployable, agile, versatile, lethal, survivable, and sustainable across the entire spectrum of military operations. FCS tactics will enable the Future Force to see first, understand first, act first and finish decisively as the means to tactical success.  This program will be a multi-functional, multi-mission re-configurable system of systems to maximize joint inter-operability, strategic transportability and commonality of mission roles including direct and indirect fire, air defense, reconnaissance, troop transport, counter mobility, non-lethal and C2 on the move. The goal of this effort is to develop a network centric advanced force structure, quantify its benefits and identify materiel solutions and technologies within the context of that force.  To achieve this goal of interoperability and commonality across the FCS, there is a requirement for a common environmental representation.Because the program requires a common environmental representation, PM FCS convened a meeting called the FCS ad-Hoc Terrain Integrated Process Team (IPT) in Rosslyn, VA on 8 May 2003.  The goal of this  meeting was “to arrive at a common understanding of the terrain data problem(s).”  The detailed discussion during this IPT meeting revolved around the question of the software required for terrain reasoning to support the requirements of the training, intelligence, and planning/mission rehearsal communities.  Based on the discussion, the FCS Configuration Control Board (CCB) charter the Geospatial Working Group (GWG), now called the Geospatial Battlespace Environment Working Group (GBE WG), to answer the questions above.  The FCS GBE WG also realized that terrain was not the only issue FCS faced in the environmental arena.  Thus, the scope of the GBE WG was amended to include the total environment and to ensure a common environmental service for all of FCS will be developed precluding redundant services.  BackgroundFor many years, the U.S. Army has focused its environment efforts on the terrain.  However, the FCS has recognized the need for the other domains of atmosphere, ocean, and space and the need to have these in a common environmental representation.  This common environment also means that the operators and trainers will be using the same environmental representation.  Also, FCS is interested in the operationally relevant environmental requirements with training embedded in the operational system and both using the same environmental data.  In order to help meet FCS training requirments, the FCS Training IPT developed the Training Common Component (TCC) program.  There are seven (7) TCCs.  One of the TCCs is called Environmental Representation (ER).  The ER has the task to identify the environmental requirements needed to fulfill the KPP and then determine what technologies either are developed or those areas that require U.S. Government agencies to develop the technologies that are needed to ensure FCS requirements are met.As mentioned above, the FCS identified the environment as an area that spans all of the FCS systems.  To that end the FCS GBE WG has the charter to define the problem space and help identify the requirements that each IPT must address.The GBE WG was redirected by PM FCS in October 2004 and January 2005 to:“reinvigorate a cross IPT detailed geospatial requirements collection and analysis effort to flush out the FCS geospatial features, attributes, enumerations and their mapping to military functions.”This paper describes the Training IPT efforts in meeting this direction by PM FCS.  However, before a detailed discussion of the Training IPTs efforts in developing its requirements, there must be a discussion of the initial work by the FCS GBE WG that defined the problem space of “what is geospatial”.The Definition of Geospatial for FCSThe FCS GBE WG under the auspices of the FCS Functional Decomposition Functional Allocation (FD/FA) effort developed the definition of “geospatial” that would apply to the FCS.  That definition is:“Mission-relevant, earth-referenced data pertaining to air, land, sea, and space.”The next question is what is the definition of air, land, sea, and space.  The GBE WG defined these terms, too.  First, the definition of “air” is:“The body of air surrounding the earth (apparently) free or unconfined space in the atmosphere; extends from the stratopause (the boundary of the mesosphere (space) and the stratosphere (air)) approximately 100km above the surface of the earth down to the earth’s surface; things fly in the air; does not include air encapsulated in caves, buildings, tunnels, etc.”The definition of “land” is:“The solid part of the earth's surface, as distinguished from the sea or water, or from the air; The physical features of the ground surface, to include the subsurface.  These physical features include both natural (e.g., a hills) and manmade (e.g., pipelines) features. Major terrain types are delineated based upon local relief, or changes in elevation, and include flat to rolling, hilly and mountainous. Other important characteristics used to describe the terrain include hydrologic features (e.g., swamps), vegetation characteristics (e.g., forests) and cultural features (e.g., cities). Complex terrain includes any characteristics or combination of characteristics that make military action, such as maneuver, difficult. Mobility classes are also used to describe the trafficability of the terrain. The three mobility classes are: unrestricted, restricted and severely restricted.”  The definition of “sea” is:“The continuous body of salt water that covers the greater part of the earth's surface and surrounds its land masses; any part of this, as opposed to land or fresh water. The Sea includes the littoral zone that extends from high tide to a depth of 200 m (660 ft).  Brackish water and inland water is not included.”Finally, the definition of “space” is:“The part of the universe that extends from the tropopause of the Earth's atmosphere outward. While a precise limit cannot be ascertained, in general it begins at about the altitude above the Earth that corresponds to the lowest stable satellite orbits and above which aerodynamic forces can no longer support the control of conventional aircraft. This is usually an altitude in excess of 100 kms.” With these definitions and the Training IPTs requirement to train on all aspects of the FCS, the Training IPT set out to define the operationally relevant features and attributes that are needed to meet the totality of the FCS mission requirements.Determining the FCS Training IPT Environmental Representation RequirementsThe main objective of during the process of determining the FCS Training IPT environmental representation requirements was to ensure the requirements have a pedigree.  This means that all FCS Training IPT environmental representation requirements must be traceable to current U.S. Army approved documents/doctrine.  Once identified the requirements were classified as air, land, sea, or space per the definition of geospatial for FCS.  Then the requirements were linked to the FCS System of System (SoS) Specification via DOORS.  This gave the Training IPT its top level requirements.  Next individual features and attributes were determined.  These were identified by reviewing the established features and attributes for the systems that FCS must be able to interoperate with and are called complementary programs.  These features and attributes were then classified as air, land, sea, space requirements.  Finally, the features and attributes were abstracted up one level.  The next several subsections will describe what the Training IPT did in these mappings. FCS Environmental RequirementsThe environmental data requirements from FCS program level documents were identified and extracted from the ORD by the Training IPT.  This list was used here.  Also, the list was provided to the GBE WG for its FD/FA requirements evaluation.  Once that effort is completed, the list of approved program requirements will be compared to those identified by the Training IPT.  This will ensure that the Training IPT has a complete list of approved program requirements.  However, most feel that the list the Training IPT developed is a good starting point.Table 1 is the current list of domain/sub-domain definitions used by the Training IPT with the FCS operational requirements spreadsheet.  This list is based on the initial version of higher level classes that have been discussed with the Data Architect Team (DAT).  As discussions continue, this list will change.  The Training IPT has provided the DAT with its suggestions for incorporating our requirements into the FCS Unit of Action (UA) Information Model (IM).  This is a Logical Data Model (LDM) that is based on the Generic Hub (GH-6) also known as the Command and Control Information Exchange Data Model (C2IEDM).  These along with the MFs discussed earlier might be the way the DAT abstracts the environmental requirements in the UA IM.  The Training IPT efforts in providing the DAT with our proposed LDM will be discussed in an accompanying paper.As stated earlier, it was our opinion that all environmental requirements (implied/derived or not) should be listed.  If it is decided that implied requirements are just that and should not be included, it is very simple to remove them as opposed to adding the implied requirements later if they are actually needed.   EMBED Excel.Sheet.8  Table 1. Domain/Sub-domain definitionsTraining IPT Feature and AttributesParallel to the effort to identify the environmental requirements, the Training IPT began development of its individual features and attribute requirements.  The initial effort to define this list of requirements used tools that had been developed by the simulation community.  Under the sponsorship of PEO STRI, AMSO, DMSO, and TEC, several systems requirements have been mapped to the Environmental Data Coding Specification (EDCS) using the Common Data Model Framework (CDMF).  Those systems were used to establish the union of the initial Training IPT environmental representation requirements.The legacy systems that were used to create this union for the FCS environmental data model were Digital Topographic Support System (DTSS), Integrated Meteorological System (IMETS), OneSAF Objective System (OOS terrain), OOS AOS, MM5, Mission Specific Data Sets (MSDS) 1-5, Littoral 1-5, Joint Common Data Model (JCDM), Joint Mapping Toolkit (JMTK), and Digital Nautical Chart (DNC).  The union of these system’s environment feature and attributes produced over 20,000 feature attribute pairs.  It is these feature attribute pairs that became the initial input for the FCS UA IM.  The Training IPT then used the ERWin data modeling tool to produce its suggested representation of these requirements in the UA IM.  ERWin was used because the C2IEDM was developed used it to represent its class structure.  This creates some problems because the FCS UA IM is being developed using Rational Rose.  This issue along with all the data modeling efforts by the Training IPT will be discussed in the accompanying paper at this conference on the Training IPT data modeling requirements and efforts.The Training IPT requires the use of the EDCS.  Further, the EDCS is required by the Training Common Component effort and is called out in the FCS Technical View (TV-1) prescribed under the DOD Architecture Framework (DODAF) process.  Additionally, the complete environment needs to be represented.  Only EDCS meets this requirement of representing the complete environment and the EDCS is a published international standard that can be extended by use of its registry to represent any new FCS environmental requirement that is found by any IPT or the GBE WG FD/FA work.  These are the primary reason the Training IPT requires the use of EDCS.  For a thorough discussion of EDCS, the reader is referred to the SEDRIS web site ( HYPERLINK "http://www.sedris.org" www.sedris.org).    While the Training IPT uses EDCS it is understood that other programs and data producers might use another dictionary for their environmental representation requirements.  To that end, the Training IPT did a series of mappings of its requirements to five (5) different dictionaries.  Those dictionaries are the EDCS, the Feature and Attribute Coding Catalog (FACC), the DGWIG Feature Data Dictionary (DFDD), the NGA Feature Data Dictionary (NFDD) and the Army Battlespace Environment (ABE) program.  These mappings are the topic of another paper being presented at this conference.  It should be pointed out that EDCS is the only one of these five that is able to represent all Training IPT requirements at this time.By using EDCS and the CDMF a union of current and legacy systems feature and attribute requirements was accomplished.  It was determined that this union should provide the Training IPT with a good initial estimate of the required environment feature and attributes.   The legacy systems identified above were used to produce the first estimate of required features and attributes.  That list had to be compared against the FCS environmental requirements.  The Training IPT did a “scrubbing” of these requirements in order to capture a comprehensive list of features and attributes.  This scrubbing is believed to represent at a high confidence level a good representation of the overall feature and attribute requirements needed to fulfill the representation of the environment.  The current list of Training IPT required environmental representation features is about 600 and the associated attributes is approximately 800.  And as pointed out above, these requirements cover the gamut of the environment (air, land, sea, space) and include the union of requirements that can be found in several legacy systems per the requirement found in the CDMF.  The one area that is not represented in this list of requirements is the urban requirements.  That list of requirements has just been recently derived.  It too has a pedigree for all its requirements to approved U.S. Army documents.  There is a sister paper to this paper at this conference describing the Training IPT efforts in determining its urban feature and attribute requirements.Military Functions and the mapping of them to the Training IPT feature and attributes along with mappings to FCS RequirementsAnother important area is development of mappings to establish a level of abstraction for the individual features and attributes.  That level of abstraction needed to be based on understood military functions.  Thus, a list of Military Functions (MF) was developed.  Table 2 is that list.  Note that the term Military Function is a misnomer in the sense that these functions describe actions that are independent of the agent executing the function.         Table 2:  List of Military Functions.Military Function1Cross-country mobility (and planning) (includes exterior UGV movement)2On-Road mobility (and planning)3Human movement inside structures and enclosures4Human movement urban exterior5Human movement non-urban exterior6Vehicle movement inside structures and enclosures (UGV)7Air unit/vehicle mobility (and planning) (includes UAV movement)8Maritime mobility (Open water and Littoral)9Riverine mobility (Rivers and Inland water)10Logistics11EO/IR propagation and sensor detection (Visible, IR, RF, MW wavelengths)12Acoustic propagation and acoustic wavelength detection13Seismic propagation and sensing14Omitted15Omitted16NBC17Airborne intelligence18Ground-based intelligence19Space-based intelligence20Space-based communications21Terrestrial communications22Battle damage assessment (BDA)23Interaction with non-combatantsWhile there can be other categories of Military Functions or other opinions of potential categories, this list was developed based the existing Military Functional Uses (MFUs) that are used by the OneSAF program and the list of tasks found in the Army Uniform Task List (AUTL).

These mappings ensure the Training IPT trains based on established missions for the UA.  The spreadsheet of the mappings of the features and attributes to the MF is not shown dues to its size.  That spreadsheet is available for review.SummaryThe Future Combat System (FCS) Training Integrated Product Team (IPT) has a program level requirement to support all facets of embedded training across the entire FCS program.
