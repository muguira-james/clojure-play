Need to agree on definition applicable to the C-BML activities based on the evaluation of the circulated definition of ICE (assigned to Andreas Tolk).Action Item Two - Discuss the process for Review (Pre-Ballot and Ballot iterations) in particular as it affects the Drafting Group. This should lead to a defined process of how we will do it in C-BML. Chuck will set up monthly telecons between DG and PDG leads.Action Item Three - Come to agreement on what the specific points of content will be for the Phase I Specification Documents. Mark Pullen presented a slide of items that were discussed at the August Meeting, and these were voted on at the SIW meeting.Decision Point One - Group decision to have a second Vice-Chair, copying the situation where we have a US and International Chair and Co-Chair, we will also have a US and International Vice-Chair and Co-Vice-Chair.
