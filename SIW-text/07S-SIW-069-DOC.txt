TES has allowed troops to train for practical missions in highly realistic combat environments without the associated risks involved with live weaponry and munitions.  Furthermore, field medical personnel have had the capability to train within these exercises, as well, through the use of the various means such as paper casualty cards and the Electronic Casualty Card (ECC), a proposed – and under development – component of the U.S. Army’s laser-based field training system that can allow correlation between virtual injuries and simulated weapons detonations [1][2].  The current development of the One Tactical Engagement Simulation System (OneTESS) will introduce several advancements in the TES environment, including a medical simulation capability that will not only model injuries and the degradation that results from those injuries, but also will allow medical trainees to implement various treatments while modeling the physiological reactions to those treatments.  This paper will serve as an introduction to this capability by first providing an introduction into TES followed by a history of the ECC.  That will segue into a detailed description of the intended capabilities and features of the Mobile Medic Application (MMA), the Personal Digital Assistant (PDA)-based tool that will facilitate the interaction between the casualty and the medic.  The paper will conclude with remarks about future research and visions for the MMA.                            IntroductionNo infantry tactical training event should be considered complete without the ability for combat medics to participate.  Indeed, in a real combat environment, medics must tend to wounded soldiers while conflict continues to rage.  As such, numerous products have been used in an attempt to enhance the realism of that training for both the medical personnel and the soldiers they virtually treat.  With the future migration of the One Tactical Simulation System (OneTESS) into the U.S. Army’s training repertoire, this medical training capability must, too, be transitioned in.  To address this need, Engineering and Computer Simulations, Inc., has developed a prototype medic application housed on a Personal Data Assistant (PDA).  This paper will describe the features and capabilities of this application as well as the initial communications interface that will allow it to interoperate with OneTESS.The following section begins with a detailed description of the OneTESS program.  OneTESS has implemented an initial demonstration of the MMA that took place in December of 2006 at the Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation & Education Conference.The next section describes the previous systems used to simulate medical casualties and treatment during TES exercises.  That is followed by a discussion of the MMA, its capabilities, features, and communications interface.  The conclusion provides a summary of the paper and a discussion of future research ideas.Tactical Engagement Simulation (TES)OneTESS is the Army’s program for the next-generation of TESS.  For greater context, consider that live training for military purposes dates back millennia [3].  Hand-to-hand combat drills under highly constrained conditions and target practice likely have histories as long as that of warfare, itself.  With the introduction of the Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) in the 1970s, live, tactical training took a quantum leap forward.  For the first time, soldiers could conduct force-on-force training under safe and, at the same time, relatively unconstrained conditions, closely reflecting the conditions experienced during actual warfare.  The application of what was then state-of-the-art laser technology enabled this advance, but this technology now faces two significant disadvantages: Lasers cannot represent indirect fire, or Non-Line-of-Sight/Beyond-Line-of-Sight (NLOS/BLOS) engagements without additional support, such as what is provided by Simulated Area Weapon Effects – Radio Frequency (SAWE-RF)Opaque and translucent obscurants that do not stop bullets, such as foliage and fog, can block laser beamsFigure 1 opposite shows a military training exercise taking place with the use of MILES equipment.  Note the equipment that makes up MILES.  The weapons in the photograph have attachments on the ends that look like metal boxes, approximately 1” X 2” X 3” in size.  These attachments fire the infrared encoded laser beams that constitute an electronic bullet.  These infrared pulses must intersect with one of numerous sensors integrated within the soldiers’ clothing.  In the picture, these sensors can be easily differentiated from the rest of the equipment as black circles, approximately one inch in diameter.  These sensors are most noticeable in a halo pattern on the Kevlar helmets and on straps going down the soldiers’ ribcages.Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 1.  Soldiers training using MILES equipmentAn important, but often overlooked, aspect to TES is the inclusion of combat medic training.  Numerous technologies and procedures have been used to facilitate in the training of medics on the battlefield.  However, all of those previous training instruments have suffered from various weaknesses.OneTESS will use a virtual medic application that will addresses these shortcomings and enhance the training value for medics within a TES training environment.  The following sections will provide a history of previous medic training tools, an introduction of the application being used in tandem with OneTESS, and an explanation of future directions.Previous Medical Applications for TESSimulated tactical training has been a part of military preparation for hundreds of years in some form or another.  Be it the Romans scripting their battles in the mountains of Switzerland and Italy or the Germans performing similar rehearsals prior to combat during both world wars, this simulated warfare has been present within the earth’s mightiest militaries.What has been absent through much of that history, however, has been the inclusion of simultaneous medic training.  This can be attributed, at least in part, to the longstanding fact that injuries on the battlefield often resulted in death.  The technology and procedures to prolong the lives of wounded on the battlefield did not yet exist, so there was no need to train for that aspect of combat.As warfare modernized, the ability to medically treat soldiers on the battlefield improved by leaps and bounds.  Because of this, the added need for training came about.  As such, technology has been developed during that timeframe to facilitate this type of training without putting soldiers at any additional risk of injury while training.This has resulted in the development of three main systems.  The first, simply called the Casualty Card, largely involves the handing out of cards that have textual descriptions of various combat injuries.  The second, a conceptual extension of the Casualty Card, is called the Electronic Casualty Card (ECC) and implements the Casualty Card in a computerized way that eliminates the need for paper cards.  The last, called the Battlefield Medical Information System – Tactical (BMIST) employs a handheld electronic device that acts as an interface between a wounded soldier and a combat medic.Casualty CardsWhen casualty simulation began diffusing into TES, the main medium for communicating wound information was in the form of casualty cards.  Casualty cards consist of variably-sized paper cards that describe the attributes of various combat-related injuries.  The simplicity associated with this system is only one of its advantages.  Another significant advantage is that the types of injuries are limited only by the type of combat being simulated during training.  For instance, in combat that includes only M16 rifles as weapons, one would not expect to see shrapnel or radiation wounds.  Additionally, this method is highly portable and inexpensive.Unfortunately, these advantages also contribute to the lack of realism as a glaring weakness.  While it does allow combat medics to practice planning and treatment in a battlefield environment while receiving critique from supervising trainers, the Casualty Cards do not allow for the opportunity to diagnose or, in most cases, directly treat the simulated casualty lying in front of them.  This lack of realism led to the drive to develop a system that would promote higher training value, eventually an computerized version called the Electronic Casualty Card.Figure 2 opposite shows a picture of a casualty card.Figure 2.  Picture of a casualty card [4]Electronic Casualty Card (ECC)The Electronic Casualty Card (ECC) [5] has offered an alternative to the primitive paper cards that allows automation of the casualty generation and treatment process and a more realistic set of injuries based upon the type of weapon used to inflict a wound and the location upon the body that the projectile hits.  Additionally, the ECC does not require additional personnel to hand out paper cards to indicate a wound.The ECC was developed by Lockheed Martin Electro Optics Systems as a vest-mounted device used in tandem with the Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) and the Simulation Area Weapons Effects (SAWE) systems with force-on-force training exercises.  A hit occurs when a MILES sensor receives an encoded infrared laser beam, prompting the ECC to generate a casualty, resulting in an appropriate type and severity of injury.  Through the use of an interrogation device that works with the ECC, a training field medic can diagnose the trauma and select a variety of treatments.  If the wounded soldier receives no medical attention or incorrect medical attention, then that casualty dies.  Conversely, proper medical intervention can stabilize and save the life of the casualty.  The ECC provides more than 40,000 symptoms and treatments as well as several bodily injury locations, including the head, neck, torso, abdomen, arms, legs, and hands, all treatable by a medic during a training exercise [6].It should be noted that, in general, the ECC has not been fielded for standard use in training.  It remains a significant component of the Army research and development effort, Combat Trauma Patient Simulator (CTPS) [6].Figure 3 below shows an illustration of soldiers wearing MILES equipment instrumented with an ECC.  The ECC resides on the left shoulder strap of the MILES vest.Figure 3.  Illustration of soldiers wearing ECC with their MILES gearBattlefield Medical Information System – Tactical (BMIST)Taking this type of interactive technology a step further, the Battlefield Medical Information System – Tactical (BMIST) originated as a handheld computer that can store and retrieve patient information for medical professionals on the battlefield.  However, the greater potential for this technology to apply to simulated training exercises was acknowledged and, thus, it has expanded into a training tool, as well.The software, developed by Fort Detrick’s Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center, has most often been resident on the iPAQ Pocket PC, manufactured by Hewlett-Packard Co., [7].For the purpose of medical training within a TES environment, BMIS-T has been used as a handheld assistant that allows medics to interact with a simulated wounded soldier.  Among the actions that can be performed are:Record interactions such as the application of various treatmentsRetrieve a history of those interactionsTransmit the history of those interactions for use in an After Action Review (AAR) [8]Figure 4 opposite shows a picture of the BMIS-T system in use.Figure 4.  BMIS-T system in use [9]The Mobile Medic Application will address the shortcomings of all of these previous systems and provide a more realistic and therefore, more valuable training experience to military medics.Mobile Medic ApplicationThe OneTESS Mobile Medical Application (MMA) will be used during OneTESS exercises to perform medical treatment on casualty wounds caused by OneTESS virtual munitions.  Because it is a live-virtual exercise environment, a soldier in a OneTESS exercise will not have any physical signs of being injured.  Two of the challenges for the MMA include bridging the gap between the virtual and the live domains and processing a medic’s treatment interventions back into the OneTESS training environment.  Information about a casualty’s wound will be kept inside the OneTESS simulation.  Medical personnel using the MMA will retrieve this information from a OneTESS player unit to create a casualty scenario on the mobile device.  The medical personnel will perform treatment interventions on the live victim and synchronize the casualty’s state with the OneTESS representation of that casualty on the mobile device.  At that point, if the soldier can continue with the exercise, a Return to Duty is initiated.  Otherwise, the soldier is evacuated or dies of wounds.The following subsections will first cover the current capabilities of the MMA that were developed for support of the 2006 Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation and Education Conference (I/ITSEC) OneTESS demonstration in Orlando, FL, and then continue with details regarding future MMA capabilities.Current CapabilitiesAs intended only for demonstration purposes in late 2006, the MMA functionality is limited but shows portions of the major features of the future capabilities.  Application AnatomyThe basic design of the current application has two main parts: Live treatment simulationAAR capabilitiesFigure 5 below shows the high-level flow diagram of the application anatomy.Figure 5.  High-level flow diagram of application anatomy [10]When the user first launches the application on the mobile device, a main menu gives the user the choices of starting the treatment simulation or retrieving AAR data from a previous treatment scenario.The treatment simulation contains a user interface where the Combat Medic can respond to a simulated treatment scenario and perform medical treatment to a wounded soldier.  Once a casualty is manually detected, the medic can perform a variety of medical procedures and treatments, as shown in Figure 6 below.Figure 6.  Selecting the Tourniquet treatment option [10]The AAR portion of the application will evaluate the performance of the user.  Students, instructors, trainers and Observer/Controllers will have the capability to review stored exercise data from the MMA.  The user will be able to review stored exercise data of the previous treatment only.  Figure 7 below shows a portion of the AAR capability.Figure 7.  AAR screen capture from MMA [10]Numerous, lower-level capabilities augment these overarching features of the MMA.  The next four subsections delve into these capabilities in greater detail.Wound Types and LocationsCurrently, the MMA supports sixteen different injury type and location combination.  At first, it might seem that any injury type could apply to any bodily location, but some simply do not make sense.  For instance, it does not seem likely to suffer from an amputation wound on the chest.Ultimately, wound types and wound locations are determined by the OneTESS player unit, and then simply supported by the MMA.  Once a soldier has been hit by an electronic munition, the wound will be available for the medic to treat.  Table 1 on the following page lists different wound locations and associated wound types.Table 1.  Wound locations and wound types [10]Body PartWoundLeg (left and right)Gunshot WoundAmputation3rd Degree BurnArm (left and right)Gunshot WoundAmputation3rd Degree BurnChestGunshot WoundAbdomenGunshot WoundShrapnelHeadGunshot WoundThe behavior of these wounds is largely determined by blood volume.  The blood volume model tracks the volume of blood within the casualty’s body.  The concept of a blood volume model is simple – the blood volume will decrease with a bleeding wound and increase with a blood transfusion.  Different wound types will have different flow rates, but there are other factors to take into consideration.  The average human has between 14 and 18 pints of blood.  After only 2 pints of blood loss, the casualty is at risk of death.  A typical transfusion of 1 unit of blood – about 1 pint – should take between 2 and 4 hours.  Blood loss rate can be as high as 1 pint per minute.  The loss of blood causes the heart rate and blood pressure to increase.  If more than 2 pints of blood are lost, the casualty dies.  Therefore, treatment becomes a race to prevent blood loss from occurring at a faster rate than blood transfusion.The overall bleeding rate is determined by computing the blood loss per body part and then summing a total.  Each body part can have a different bleeding rate based upon the type of wound it has.  Furthermore, the restriction of blood flow is determined by the treatment.  For example, a gauze on an amputation will slow, but not stop, the bleeding.  Only the application of a tourniquet can stop the bleeding caused by an amputation injury.  Thus, the application of the correct treatment becomes critical to the survival of the casualty [10].Physiological ModelTo create realistic virtual casualties and treatment interventions in a live training environment, a physiological model that simulates how a body would react to wounds and treatments is needed.  If a casualty has severe bleeding and is left without treatment for too long, the soldier will bleed to death.  If the medic applies a tourniquet, the bleeding will stop and the casualty will have a better chance of survival.  Modeling the casualty’s physiology is important because it gives the user feedback on the effects of treatment interventions performed on the casualty [10].  It should be noted that this model was developed solely for the I/ITSEC demonstration of a proof-of-concept and lacks scientific merit.  It is based largely on the circulation system.  The application that will eventually be fielded, however, will receive approval from the Army Medical Department (AMEDD).EquipmentThe MMA will also support the ability of a medic to carry a limited amount of medical supplies into the field.  This will be determined by collective weight, ensuring that a training medic is unable to carry unrealistic amounts of medical equipment onto the battlefield.  The equipment that is current available is:Bandage – applied after gauze will stop bleeding to gunshots and shrapnel woundsGauze – applied by itself to a wound will only slow down bleedingScissors – removes clothingStethoscope – can be used to check the heart and lungsTourniquet – stops bleeding to appendage wound bleedingThis set of equipment supports basic lifesaving techniques and procedures [10].ExaminationsExaminations are available to check the vitals of the casualty.  These vitals are all affected by the loss of blood.  The MMA allows for the examination of the following medical cues:pulseairwayblood pressurerespirationsOnce again, these examination capabilities support basic lifesaving techniques and procedures [10].MMA-OneTESS InterfaceThis section covers the preliminary MMA Interface Control Document (ICD).  This defines what information will need to be included in an application protocol for MMA interoperability with the OneTESS player unit of the medic.  The ICD consists of the Protocol Data Units (PDU) that are communicated between the MMA and the OneTESS Player Unit.  The PDUs defined in this section should not be confused with those of the Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) protocol.The MMA current uses the following set of PDUs:Get Wound QueryReport WoundSet Casualty StatusEach of these PDUs has a distinct role pertaining to the communication between the MMA and a OneTESS player unit.  The following sections describe these PDUs and their roles in greater detail.PDU HeaderEvery PDU will use this header, which contains general information that is shared among all the PDU types.  Table 2 below breaks down the content of the PDU header.Table 2.  PDU header breakout [10]FieldBit LengthDescriptionVersion8PDU Protocol VersionType Field8PDU TypeData Packet Length16PDU data portion length in octetsTimestamp32PDU creation timeChecksum32Data verification, does not include headerThe Get Wound Query PDU initiates the transfer of a casualties status to the MMA, by essentially asking the OneTESS player unit if the soldier with which it is associated has suffered an injury.  This PDU is remarkable in that it is notated by the appropriate Type Field value in the PDU header and it has no PDU body.  That is, only a header is sent.The OneTESS player unit responds to the Get Wound Query PDU regardless of its health status with a Report Wound PDU.  If the soldier is uninjured, then the wound type is zero, corresponding to a healthy soldier.  The breakout of the Report Wound PDU is shown in Table 3.Table 3.  Report Wound PDU [10]FieldBit LengthDescriptionPDU Header96PDU Protocol VersionWound type8Type of wound sufferedWound location8Bodily location of woundWound severity81 (least severe) to 10 (most severe)PDU padding8Wound duration32Time in seconds since the wound occurredOnce a casualty has completed treatment, its status is updated to the OneTESS player unit with a Set Casualty Status PDU.  The casualty status can have one of three values, determined in tandem by the medic and the simulation, itself:Return to dutyEvacuate (EVAC)Died of woundsTable 4 below breaks out the content of the Set Casualty Status PDU.Table 4.  Set Casualty Status PDU [10]FieldBit LengthDescriptionPDU Header96PDU Protocol VersionNew Casualty Status8Status of the casualty following treatmentPDU padding24Through the design and use of these PDUs, the foundation is laid for future – and more meaningful – interaction between a OneTESS player unit and the MMA.  More generally, this is one step closer to having a meaningful training experience for a combat medic within a TES training environment [10].Training with the MMAThe inclusion of the MMA within a TES training event can allow a more comprehensive training experience for the entire range of personnel on a battlefield.  Currently, only limited opportunities exist to train battlefield medics during the heat of the battle.  The use of this tool can change that situation.  The following bullets describe the flow of a typical use case for the MMA.A soldier is hit by simulated gunfire, shrapnel, or in some way affected by discharged weaponrySimulated injuries are initiated for that soldier, including a time-out clock that indicates how long the soldier has to live if left untreatedEventually, a medic who carries the MMA arrives at the injured soldier (or group of injured soldiers)The medic uses the MMA to establish a wireless connection with the OneTESS player unit(s) and determine which soldier(s) require attention firstThe medic uses the MMA to assume the simulation of the soldier’s woundsThe medic uses the MMA to apply various treatments to the soldier in an effort to stabilize the simulated injuriesDuring this process, the MMA wirelessly sends state updates to the OneTESS player unit to prevent the soldier from dying of woundsWhen the medic is finished treating a particular soldier – that is, when the wounded soldier can return to duty, must be evacuated, or has died of wounds – control returns to the OneTESS player unitWith the combination of this flow and the individual capabilities afforded by the MMA, a more seamless and realistic training environment can be achieved for battlefield medics.  More difficult diagnosing situations, numerous treatment options, and eventually a larger toolset will allow medics to prepare for more varieties of situations.Conclusion and Future WorkAdding a medical simulation capability to OneTESS fulfills a significant need within the TES environment.  To fully simulate the battlefield and the military roles that must play out on that battlefield, medical simulation capabilities for TES must exist.  The Mobile Medic Application (MMA) addresses that need.The MMA currently has a small subset of capabilities that served as a successful proof-of-concept demonstrated at the 2006 I/ITSEC.  In the coming months, the MMA will assume added functionality that will enhance its effectiveness in delivering realistic and effective training capabilities.Most notably, the number of wound locations, wound types, and their combinations will expand, as shown in Table 5 below.Table 5.  Future wound locations and wound typesBody PartWoundLeg (left and right)Gunshot WoundAmputation3rd Degree BurnFracture (open and closed)Blunt TraumaArm (left and right)Gunshot woundAmputation3rd Degree BurnLacerationFracture (open and closed)Blunt TraumaDislocationChestGunshot wound w/ exit woundLacerationSucking Chest Wound3rd Degree BurnTension PneumothoraxBlunt TraumaBackExit Gunshot WoundLacerationSpine Injury3rd Degree BurnBlunt TraumaAbdomenGunshot WoundShrapnelLaceration3rd Degree BurnBlunt TraumaHeadGunshot WoundLaceration3rd Degree BurnBlunt TraumaGeneralHeat StrokeHypovolaemic ShockIn addition to the greater number of wounds, the physiological models will undergo detailed enhancements.  For instance, the blood volume model will be composed of discretized bins as described in Table 6 below.Table 6.  Discretized blood volume model% Blood LossClinical Signs<15Slightly increased heart rate, local swelling15-25Increased heart rate, increased diastolic pressure, prolonged capillary refill25-50Above plus:  hypotension, confusion, acidosis, decreased urine output>50Refractory hypotension, refractory acidosis, deathIn addition to these enhancements, a heart model, blood pressure model, and respiratory model with detailed outputs will be used to generate more descriptive casualty status reports.Furthermore, a greater list of supplies will be available for use by the medic trainee.  Four different aid bags will be available to contain the equipment from the following categories, with examples:Airway Supplies – Nasopharyngeal airways, Oropharyngeal airwaysBreathing Supplies – Vaseline gauze pads, Asherman chest sealCirculation Supplies – Kerlix, CravatsFracture Supplies – Sam splints, Ace wrapsAntibiotics – Gatifloxacin tablets, CefotetanPain Medications – Morphine Tubex injectors, ToradolNuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) Medications – Nerve Agent Antidote Kit (NAAK) injector, Convalescent Antidote for Nerve Agents (CANA) injectorMiscellaneous Supplies – Large abdominal pad, Band-AidsThe number and types of treatments will also increase dramatically in future versions of the MMA, allowing the tool to more effectively prepare combat medics for their role within a real combat environment.Altogether, these improvements will serve to significantly enhance the ability of a combat medic to train within a TES training event.  This will ultimately equate to a better prepared and more deadly fighting force that will better withstand the rigors and unpredictabilities of real combat.References[1]	Proctor, Michael D., and Greg S.
