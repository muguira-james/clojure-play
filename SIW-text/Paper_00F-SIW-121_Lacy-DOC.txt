IntroductionComputer Generated Forces (CGFs) rely on behavior specifications to support realistic simulations.  The US Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Analysis Center (TRAC) in Monterey, California is sponsoring Army standards research to promote behavior reuse in next generation simulations.   The project will deliver proposed standards for representing behaviors using the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) and examples of marked up behaviors from legacy simulations.  XML is designed to facilitate structured data interchange by providing a means to model data at various levels of complexity.  XML also provides validation mechanisms to check data for structural correctness, format independence to publish content in multiple formats, and vendor and platform independence to process any conforming document using standard commercial software.  The project’s long-term research goals include reduced simulation development times and improved interoperability between CGF simulations by standardizing the interchange of behavior data.  This effort leverages prior XML-based standards research for simulation data [1] and specifically scenario data [2].2. CGF Behavior Specification EffortCGF systems are increasingly data driven.  New Army CGF systems such as Warfighter’s Simulation 2000 (WARSIM) and OneSAF require behavior specifications read by the simulation software [3].  CGF sponsors and developers invest significant resources into developing behaviors and authoritative conceptual models of domain expertise to support behavior development.The process of describing accurate representations of CGF behaviors is complex [4.  This project involved developing a CGF Behavior Specification Data Interchange Format (DIF) by reviewing legacy CGF systems, reviewing various behavior-related representations, designing a set of logical data sub-models, developing an XML Document Type Definition (DTD) to represent the model, and demonstrating the use of sample data with off-the-shelf applications.The research identified legacy behavior representation schemes from the Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT) Semi-Automated Forces (SAF), ModSAF, and WARSIM.  Assessing these behavior representations highlighted data requirements necessary to support behavior interchange standards.  Researchers categorized common data elements among the legacy behaviors to identify groupings of required data elements.  Next, existing representation standards were reviewed to determine their applicability for describing behaviors.  This information was used to develop a set of logical data sub-models.  The  sub-models provided detailed descriptions for representing metadata, knowledge representation constructs, declarative knowledge, procedural knowledge, and strategic knowledge.  Researchers then developed an XML representation of the data model and documented the data model in a DTD specification.  Researchers translated selected sample behaviors from the three legacy simulations into XML representation.  Once in XML, developers used commercial-off-the-shelf tools that support the XML data standard to manipulate the CGF behaviors.2.1 Legacy CGF AnalysisA review of existing (legacy) CGF behavior methods was performed to help identify common data elements.  The review focused on CCTT, ModSAF, and WARSIM.  Figure 1 presents a comparison of the knowledge representation mechanisms used in the development of the three legacy systems. CGF behaviors are developed by representing the “real world” based on descriptions from Authoritative Data Sources (ADSs).  These descriptions are used to develop Knowledge Acquisition (KA) and Knowledge Engineering (KE) documents.  Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) and Software Design Documents (SDDs) provide guidance to implement the behaviors.  The behaviors are represented in data and read by code, or directly implemented in code.The legacy analysis included a review of the subject systems’ knowledge development processes. The review of legacy systems demonstrated the difficulty in developing a common interchange format.  Differences in behavior representation range from CCTT’s hard-coded Finite State Machines (FSMs) in Ada, to WARSIM’s complex Behavior Definition Frame (BDF) behaviors described in the Behavior Specification Language (BSL).  Table 1 consolidates the various knowledge representation constructs into a knowledge representation framework based on Zachman’s Information Systems Architecture [5]. Researchers determined that no single representation format can be identified as the best reuse  format.  Formats must be considered in relation to the behavior development process and other formats within that process.  Based on the review of legacy systems, the standard for sharing CGF behaviors should support the description of metadata, process actors, and process steps within a structured syntax. The best candidates for reuse among the legacy representations reviewed were the CCTT Combat Instruction Sets (CIS), ModSAF Conceptual Models (CM), and WARSIM Behavior Definition Frames (BDF)2.2 Existing Standard RepresentationsA review of existing knowledge representation standards was conducted to determine if any were applicable to CGF behavior development.  A wide variety of existing standards were reviewed.  The standards deemed most useful for reuse addressed requirements for syntax, planning constructs, process details, simple documentation, lexicon, and metadata.One challenge in reviewing existing standards for applicability to CGF behaviors is the diversity of CGF systems.  The scope of the CGF behaviors language must be clearly define the types of behaviors supported.  It became apparent that no single existing representation standard supports all CGF behavior specification requirements.  However, several existing standards can support a subset of the CGF behavior representation requirements.  Elements of the existing standards can be reused in defining the CGF behavior specification language. Figure 1. Comparison of Knowledge Representation SchemesTable 1.

The Resource Description Framework (RDF) [6] is defined using XML.  RDF was identified as a candidate for satisfying the syntax requirements of the specification.  The Core Plan Representation (CPR) [7] was identified as reusable for representing planning constructs. The sDocBook standard [8] was selected as the best candidate for representing simple documentation information.  The Conceptual Models of the Mission Space (CMMS) Common Semantics and Syntax (CSS) could be used for supporting the military ontology/lexicon required by the users of the CGF behavior specification [9].  The vCard [10] and Dublin Core [11] standards support metadata reuse.2.3 Data ModelA logical data model must support implementation-independent behavior representations and unique representations implemented by legacy systems.  The data model supports a variety of representation methods.  However, additional knowledge representation sub-model entities will be required to support new representation techniques such as neural networks, case based reasoning, and active networks [12].The logical data model was separated into the following major sub-models, in increasing level of complexity:Metadata, Knowledge Representation Constructs,Declarative,Procedural, andStrategic.The definition of these sub-models is based on commonly identified Knowledge Representations categories [13].The logical data model was developed to describe the behaviors specification.  The data model is intended to be a first description that will evolve as research continues.  The logical data model was depicted using the Integration Definition Language for information modeling version 1X (IDEF1X) format [14].  IDEF1X is the DoD’s preferred language for representing data models.  An associated data dictionary was developed that details entities and attributes presented in the data model diagram.2.4 XML Data Interchange FormatXML was selected as the method for describing the data interchange for the behavior data.  XML is a meta language – a language for describing languages [15].  XML languages use markup similar to hypertext markup language (HTML) found on most websites.  XML is beginning to be used by several DoD simulation-related applications. XML has been embraced by major developers of COTS including Oracle and Microsoft.  The availability of COTS to support XML files reduces the investment required in custom software development.2.5 Sample BehaviorsSample data was taken from CCTT CISs, ModSAF CMs, and WARSIM BDFs for translation into the XML standard.  The data was read by commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) tools to demonstrate the ability to use tools without custom coding to manipulate XML files.Unfortunately, only the WARSIM data contained rich descriptions of behaviors.  The CCTT CIS and ModSAF CMs were primarily textual descriptions.  Representing finite state machine level behavior descriptions would have required reverse engineering the representations from software.3. ConclusionsThe development of next generation simulations often involves lengthy timelines and high costs.  The result is expensive objective systems delivered with dated technology.  The modeling and simulation community continues to research techniques to ensure training and analysis centers are supported with modern, cost-effective simulations.  Reuse of CGF behaviors saves development resources, but requires technologies described in this paper to be an effective technique.  Specifically, enabling developers to select, manipulate, and integrate existing behaviors using XML and COTS tools that support the XML data standard will significantly improve simulation development times and enhance interoperability between models.  4.
