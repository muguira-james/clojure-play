Name of Forum or Group:  Distributed Simulation Process and Tools (DSPT)ChairJake BorahVice ChairJane BachmanSecretaryPierre GauvinObjectives for this Workshop:  DiscussProcesses for developing distributed simulationsTools for developing distributed simulationsExercise planning and management1. 06S-SIW-056, “Proposed Meta-Data for Describing Simulation Representational Capabilities” (Joint Session with VV&A forum: 41 attendees)Key points:Need a good set of meta-data to facilitate reuse.A smaller set of meta-data is more likely to be used and be usefulUse abstraction which is facilitated by understanding causality, domain, errors, etc…Don’t need to know the internals, but the inputs, outputs, …Recommendation:Merge abstraction based meta-data with some other methods to improve composability 2. 06S-SIW-009, “An Application Extension for the Military Scenario Definition Language” (Joint Session with CFI forum: 35 attendees)Key points:Scenario generation needs to be automated for portability, simulation independenceCultureSim: Urban warfare, crowdsNeeded to decouple MSDL from MSDE (Military Scenario Definition Environment)Identify C-BML 5Ws in MSDLUse C2IEDM as common reference modelUse web servicesExtensions to MSDL: basic definitions; stochastic behavior: agents, groups and crowdsRecommendation:Can use MSDL to initialize C-BML and C2IEDMMSDL needs formal extensions which must be validated – pass on to MSDL PDGCultureSim requires extensions, but not necessarily via MSDLShould enumerations be part of MSDL or should they be an extension?Pass on identified gaps to MSDL PDG3. 06S-SIW-042, “Reducing Integration Time and Risk with the HLA Evolved Encoding Helpers” (Joint Session with CFI forum: 27 attendees)Key points:Information models required to exchange data between systemsData needs to be encoded IAW data modelSometimes there are errors in encodingEncoding is standardized in HLA 1516Recommendation:Use encoding helper classes – make part of HLA evolved 4. 06S-SIW-087, “Experiences with an XML Format & Syntax for Describing Interoperability” (Joint Session with CFI forum: 41 attendees)Key points:Need interoperability descriptionsBuild on Net Unity architecture (05F-SIW 074) and related to “A Performance Evaluation of Dynamically Generated Gateways” (06S-SIW 086)Separate data transformation and processingXML Interoperability Description based on XSLTXML is error-prone and hard to readExtending XID in XML is tedious and requires schema changeRecommendation:Look at alternatives to XMLUse programming language? Potentially C# and .Net5. 06S-SIW-115, “From FOMs to BOMs and Back Again” (Joint Session with CFI forum: 40 attendees)Key points:BOMs can help improve composabilityUse of BOMWorks to create object and behavior BOMs from FOMFrom BOMS to BOM assembly to FOMRPR BOMRecommendation:Converting FOM to BOM improves composability thru atomicityLet people know about availability of RPR BOM on www.BOM.info6. 06S-SIW-116, “Adding Aggregate Services to the Mix: An SOA Implementation Use Case” (Joint Session with CFI forum:  51 attendees)Key points:Problem: obfuscated interoperability. Sometimes requires bridgesUse SOA to improve interoperabilityNeed to facilitate aggregation BOM Aggregation FrameworkModel aggregation vs entity instance aggregationRecommendation:Implement aggregation to reduce processingUse SOA construct to provide aggregation service7. 06S-SIW-040, “Introducing the Federation Engineering Lessons Learned Exchange” (32 attendees)Key points:Sponsored by DMSOWeb site to collect lessons learned from all practitionersAim to produce a best practices guide based on lessons learnedRecommendation:Join, participate and contributeDSPT forum will initiate a standing federation listing as an aid to help research into federation best practices.8. 06S-SIW-031, “Planning and Execution of Distributed Military Training Events Using a Browser-Based Integrated Collaborative Environment” (18 attendees)Key points:Use distributed collaborative environment to plan distributed simulationsSOA constructReserve resources, allocated JITRecommendation:Distributed events require distributed planning9. 06S-SIW-130, “Multi-Simulator Interface (MSI) for Complex Sessions” (15 attendees)Key points:Developed MSI – Significant reduction in size of code and LAN trafficOpen Source - Msi.sourceforge.netXML socket streamNo transformation of data on sending. Local transformation if requiredRecommendation:Simple tool for connecting simulations Small number of simple interfacesLooking for volunteers to test and build10. 06S-SIW-012, “Obstacles to Producing Realistic Urban Traffic in a Distributed Environment” (Joint Session with VWS/LOG forums:  28 attendees)Key points:CultureSim – distributed simulatorLimit behaviorLane based vs vehicle basedDDMLatencyDead reckoning algorithm also improved performanceRecommendation:More work on ownership managementIsolate as library 11. 06S-SIW-059, “Incremental HLA-Based Distributed Simulation Cloning on Object Instance Level” (XX attendees)Comments and Recommendations:DSPT forum will disseminate information about availability of the RPR BOMDSPT forum will initiate a standing list of active federations.DSPT forum will disseminate information on how to apply for access to the Federations Lessons Learned web site (url:  HYPERLINK "https://partners.mitre.org/sites/hla_ll/default.aspx" \t "_blank" https://partners.mitre.org/sites/hla_ll/default.aspx)DSPT forum will disseminate information on how to access the source code for the Multi-Simulator InterfaceAverage attendance (excluding joint sessions)21Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)32 – 040Peak attendance (including joint sessions)51 – 116Total papers presented10“No-show” presentations1Other presentations and panel discussionsNARecommended Reading List nomination: 06S-SIW-115, “From FOMs to BOMs and Back Again”06S-SIW-116, “Adding Aggregate Services to the Mix: An SOA Implementation Use Case”                 2006 SPRING SIW OUTBRIEF FORM
