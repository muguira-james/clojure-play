One of the tasks assigned to the Study Group was to produce a C4ISR/Sim TRM User Guide.  This report represents a preliminary release of the User Guide.

To address this issue, the Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization (SISO) [1] initially chartered a Study Group (SG) for M&S-to-Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) Interoperability (SG-C4I), which began work at the 1999 Fall Simulation Interoperability Workshop (SIW) and submitted a final report [2] at the Fall 2000 SIW.  This report analyzed and discussed the status quo, and recommended a course to follow with respect to C4ISR/Simulation (C4ISR/Sim) interoperability.  Specifically, the report recommended the formation of a follow-on C4ISR/Sim SG to begin work on a broad-based Technical Reference Model (TRM), which would provide a standard frame of reference describing and categorizing interoperability among, and supporting the interfacing of, C4ISR systems and simulations. This C4ISR/Sim TRM SG I began work at the Spring 2001 SIW and submitted a Final Report  [3], which outlined the basis for a C4ISR/Sim TRM and recommended that a follow-on study group be chartered by SISO to continue the development of the C4ISR/Sim TRM.  Some of the immediate goals of the C4ISR/Sim TRM SG II included:A C4ISR/Sim TRM Use-Case studyInitial development of a TRM SourcebookInitial development of a TRM User GuideThe first of these tasks was reported at the Spring 2003 SIW [4]; the second is being reported concurrently with this paper [5].  This report covers the third task, that of initial development of a TRM User Guide, the basic goal of which is to facilitate the use of the TRM.1.2	Continuing Development of the TRMThe TRM SG I provided a set of guiding principles for developing the C4ISR/Sim TRM which state that the TRM must be:ComprehensiveEasy to InterpretTraceableUsableIndependentThese derive from the definition and purpose of the model, and are to be adhered to in all further development.  The SG also recommended the analysis of use-cases as a basis for analyzing a proposed TRM against its guiding principles.  These use-cases should cover end-user and provider situations from both the C4ISR and M&S perspectives and should address the identified domain challenges. It was further recommended that the SG II endeavor to document use-cases within the following areas: US DoD DII COE NATO Command & Control ComponentsInterface DevelopmentFAA Application Domains DoD Test Range OperationsTrack Data ManagementThis preliminary version of the User Guide is based on analysis of two US DoD use-cases [4]. A comprehensive goal of future versions of the guide is to provide a model for use-case analysis in the context of the TRM Functional Interface Graphic (FIG) [5,6], the C4ISR Interoperability Lexicon [7], and the C4I FOM [8-11].  It will only be through establishment of a comprehensive use-case history, through user feedback, that we will achieve a robust User Guide and the establishment of the TRM as a useful frame of reference.  It is intended that the User Guide, as a living document, will grow with increased use-case analysis, and evolve into a useful tool for supporting interface development.In Section 2 of this report, we present a high-level review of the C4ISR/Sim TRM FIG, and in Section 3 we review the previously reported use-case analyses.  In Section 4, we give a more detailed presentation of the TRM FIG, information exchange categories, as reported by Carr [6] at the Spring 2003 SIW, and summarized by Caylor, et al [5].  In Section 5, we re-analyze the two use-cases in the context of the new TRM FIG and attempt to relate the information exchange data to the C4I FOM.2.0  The TRM Functional Interface GraphicA generic view of the functional interface between systems and simulations is shown in Figure 1. On the left, we have a C4ISR system whose structure will depend on various influences, including the constraints placed upon it by its operating environment.  For example, U.S. DoD systems may be constrained by the DII COE, while NATO systems will have other constraints.  On the simulation side there will be attributes of the models defined by the requirements of the simulation.Figure 1.  Generic View of a C4ISR/Simulation InterfaceA more detailed view of such an interface, Figure 2, was included in the SG I Final Report [3].  The function of the interface is to:1. Control the information flow between the C4I system and the simulations and2.  Align the information among the systems so that the information is received in a system’s native format.In addition to the functions that an interface must perform, the TRM graphic identifies three general classes of data that must be exchanged between simulations and C4I systems to support full interoperability: Execution Control, Persistent Data and Non-Persistent Data. Persistent Data includes nonvariant, or slowly varying data such as Order-of-Battle (OB) information that a C4I system would have in an OB database. Non-persistent data is the type of data that would be represented as interactions in an object model.The TRM also supports physics effects modeling, such as communication effects modeling, which provides communications realism through the calculation of the effects of the communications channel through which the data is passed. Figure 2.  C4I/Simulation Interoperability TRM Graphic3.0  Review of Previous Use-Case AnalysesThis preliminary version of the User Guide is based largely on the processes outlined in “A Model for Use-Case Analysis For the C4ISR/Sim Technical Reference Model” [4], which reviewed two specific US DoD use-cases, in the context of the TRM.  One of these use-cases involved the linkage of a C4I Collection Management System to an Intelligence Sensor Simulation Interface [12], and the other, the Interfacing a C4I System to Tactical Communications Simulations [13].  The second case was chosen primarily because its approach could serve as an archetype for the interoperability of C4I systems and simulations.As stated in the introduction, an immediate goal is to develop modus operandi for use-case analysis.  We begin by reviewing the analysis of the two use-cases for interfacing of systems and simulations analyzed in Reference 5.  In both use-cases, the analysis was done in hindsight, after the simulations had already been performed. The use-case analysis involved categorizing the actual data transfers of the simulations under the broad headings provided by the TRM Functional Interface Graphic.Table 1 illustrates how data transfers, selected from the first use-case, aligned with the broad categories of data exchange defined in the TRM Functional Interface Graphic.  Column one of the table lists the TRM categories.  Column two lists data exchange items used in the simulation interfaces.  Column three describes how the data exchange was accomplished.TRM CategoryInterface QuantityExchange MethodExercise Control InteractionsInitialization/ExecutionInitialization of target databaseJCMT and TACSIM databases with target characteristics must be manually reconciled.Data CollectionCollection requestsInterface saves input requirements messages and output mission tasksOn-Persistent DataOrdersRequirements messagesAutomation assisted translation from messages to TSIR’sReportsCollection reports (TACELINT, TACREP, etc.)TACSIM generates collection reports which are accepted by JCMT and ASASTracksActual status of collection assetsAborted missions must be manually enteredNon-Persistent DataUnit DataAsset characteristicsJCMT and TACSIM asset characteristics must be manually reconciled.

Comparison of Technical Reference Model Data Exchange Categories with JCMT to TACSIM Interface QuantitiesWhen broadly interpreted, the various categories of the TRM did correspond to issues that had to be addressed in the use-case interfaces, indicating that the model is of value in guiding interface development efforts.One element of the actual simulation, not accounted for in the TRM, was a requirement to add or transform information within the interface.  For example, the simulation was required to transform general collection requests into specific asset taskings.  This requirement arises because C4I systems normally have humans on each end interpreting the data elements.  In this case, and often in the other C4I/M&S interface cases, there is a need to minimize the human (manpower) requirements on the simulation side.  This was achieved by incorporating artificial intelligence and automation assisted components into the JCMT to TACSIM Interface. The simulation incorporated a complex mission optimization process that allowed a single controller to perform the functions of multiple asset managers.  The second use-case involved the linking of a real C4I device, called the Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2) with a tactical communications simulation.  The FBCB2 is a C4I system that has the capability to send and receive messages via tactical radios.  The modeled simulation involved Tactical Internet (TI) federates.  This case was chosen primarily because its approach could serve as an archetype for the interoperability of C4I systems and simulations.In Table 2, we have selected a few examples pertinent to the analysis.  An example of Persistent Data, in this use-case, was Order-of-Battle (OB) information that C4I systems would have in an OB database.  The simulation used a copy of the FBCB2 persistent OB data in its own database server, and each of the simulated components queried the database on startup.  OB data and the communications plan, which is part of the TI, are shown in the table, along with examples of CategoryInterface QuantityExchange MethodPersistent DataOrder of Battle DataSTORM simulations use a copy of the FBCB2 persistent OB databaseNon-persistent dataC2 dataCommunicated between the simulations and the FBCB2s continuously using the JVMF standardSA dataCommunicated between the simulations and the FBCB2s continuously using the JVMF standardData that was not represented in the TRM GraphicGPS dataCIGNM simulation provided realistic unit position locations of objectsCommunications EffectsCommunications degradationApplied to messages by Communications Effects ServerTable 2.  Comparison of TRM Data Exchange Categories with STORM to Tactical Internet Interface Quantitiesother non-persistent data types, which, while part of the actual simulations, are not applicable in this study.Again, when broadly interpreted, the various categories of the TRM did correspond to issues that had to be addressed in the use-case interfaces, and we found the TRM FIG to be a useful tool in helping to characterize transactions among systems and simulations. For example, under Simulation Effects, the TRM supports communication effects modeling which provides communications realism through the calculation of the effects of the communications channel through which the data is passed.  This category of the TRM FIG was required in [13] to support communications degradation data provided by the Communication Effects Server in the Tactical Internet simulations.  Other data the TRM FIG helped classify, included an Order of Battle database which fell under the Persistent Data category; and C2 and SA data, which fell under the Non-Persistent Data category.However, as in the first case, there were elements of the simulation requirements not fully supported by the TRM FIG.  For example, the simulation used Global Positioning System (GPS) data, a data type not explicitly supported by the TRM FIG.  While this is not a short coming of the graphic, which is intended to define broad categories of interface data, it does indicate a need for a database underlying the graphic, which can be queried for information relevant to specific interface or interoperability elements.4.0  TRM Information Exchange CategoriesThe use-case analyses presented in Section 3.0 were based on the TRM FIG depicted in Figure 2.  The FIG has evolved since the use-cases were generated. The version presented in Figure 3, and in the C4ISR/Sim TRM Sourcebook [5], was introduced by Carr at the Spring 2003 SIW [6].  It now describes four categories of information exchanged between C4ISR and simulation systems, as shown in Table 3.The TRM FIG is described at some length in the Sourcebook.  The primary purpose of Table 3 is to identify sources that provide additional details for each information exchange subcategory.  In this preliminary release of the User Guide, the references shown in Table 3 are, with the exception of [03S-SIW-028], papers that generally describe the subcategories. As more use-cases are received, they will be referenced against the appropriate subcategories.Figure 3.

TRM FIG Information Exchange Categories5.0	Relating TRM Information Exchange Categories to the C4I FOMIn our previous use-case analyses [4], the second use-case [13] message interactions and GPS data interactions were compared with the SISO C4I FOM [8-11] in the context of the TRM FIG. These interactions were found to be subclasses of generic interactions of the Tactical Internet Model Suite FOM [8], which itself uses a subset of the prototype C4I FOM objects and interactions.  In general, it was possible to draw a one-to-one correspondence from a C4I system through the TRM FIG to a C4I FOM entity corresponding to an entity in the simulation.   Therefore, we found that the C4I FOM could be used as a Reference FOM (RFOM) in cataloging these transactions.  However, further development of a C4ISR RFOM will be required to provide a comprehensive set of interactions to support TRM users.Table 4 is an extract from the Object Class Structure Table of the C4I FOM.  While we do not work with all of the elements shown, we show them as examples from the FOM.  In Table 5, in a heuristic approach, and without intent to be exhaustive, we relate selected entities to the class entities, and draw a one-to-one correspondence from a C4I system through the TRM to a C4I FOM entity corresponding to an entity in the simulation.  The intent is to show a tracing from system to simulation via the TRM and the FOM. We also included one example of Execution Control.  We could have shown others.  For example, the C4I FOM includes  HYPERLINK "E:\HLA\FOMs\CMSE-8 html\inter_4.html" FederateHeartbeat for the Communications Server and the GPS Server. A next step in development of the User Guide will be the complete set of FOM entries corresponding to the Information Exchange Categories delineated in Section 4 of this report.  It is anticipated that this will lead to the construction of a C4ISR/Sim Interoperability TRM RFOM, which in itself should be a subset of a SISO C4ISR RFOM.Class1Class2Class3 HYPERLINK "E:\HLA\FOMs\CMSE-8 html\object_18.html" Message (N) HYPERLINK "E:\HLA\FOMs\CMSE-8 html\object_19.html" TextMessage (PS)  HYPERLINK "E:\HLA\FOMs\CMSE-8 html\object_44.html" VoiceMessage (PS)  HYPERLINK "E:\HLA\FOMs\CMSE-8 html\object_20.html" CommEffects (N) HYPERLINK "E:\HLA\FOMs\CMSE-8 html\object_21.html" NetworkDelay (PS)  HYPERLINK "E:\HLA\FOMs\CMSE-8 html\object_22.html" PathLoss (PS)  HYPERLINK "E:\HLA\FOMs\CMSE-8 html\object_41.html" Jamming (PS)  HYPERLINK "E:\HLA\FOMs\CMSE-8 html\object_42.html" Interference (PS)  HYPERLINK "E:\HLA\FOMs\CMSE-8 html\object_23.html" C4Idevice (N) HYPERLINK "E:\HLA\FOMs\CMSE-8 html\object_24.html" EndUserSystem (N) HYPERLINK "E:\HLA\FOMs\CMSE-8 html\object_25.html" C2Device (PS) HYPERLINK "E:\HLA\FOMs\CMSE-8 html\object_40.html" IWDevice (PS) HYPERLINK "E:\HLA\FOMs\CMSE-8 html\object_33.html" NetworkDevice (PS)  HYPERLINK "E:\HLA\FOMs\CMSE-8 html\object_38.html" RadioDevice (PS)  HYPERLINK "E:\HLA\FOMs\CMSE-8 html\object_26.html" CommNetwork (PS)   HYPERLINK "E:\HLA\FOMs\CMSE-8 html\object_27.html" IWEffects (N) HYPERLINK "E:\HLA\FOMs\CMSE-8 html\object_28.html" UnauthorizedAccess (PS)  HYPERLINK "E:\HLA\FOMs\CMSE-8 html\object_29.html" DenialOfService (N) HYPERLINK "E:\HLA\FOMs\CMSE-8 html\object_31.html" ForcedSuicide (PS) HYPERLINK "E:\HLA\FOMs\CMSE-8 html\object_32.html" Flooding (PS) HYPERLINK "E:\HLA\FOMs\CMSE-8 html\object_30.html" SpoofingAttack (PS)  HYPERLINK "E:\HLA\FOMs\CMSE-8 html\object_34.html" NavDevice (PS)   HYPERLINK "E:\HLA\FOMs\CMSE-8 html\object_35.html" Fed_Status (N) HYPERLINK "E:\HLA\FOMs\CMSE-8 html\object_36.html" Fed_Status_CIGNM (PS)  HYPERLINK "E:\HLA\FOMs\CMSE-8 html\object_37.html" Fed_Status_NavClient (PS)  HYPERLINK "E:\HLA\FOMs\CMSE-8 html\object_39.html" CommUser (PS)  Table 4.

Given the variety of M&S applications, and the need to address legacy, interim, and future needs, it must also be comprehensive.   This paper just represents the preliminary release of the User Guide, which will ultimately diverge from the Sourcebook and take the form of a handbook.  In this context, this section outlines an emerging interoperability analysis process (Figure 4).6.1	Interoperability Analysis ProcessThe interoperability analysis process begins when a requirement for a simulation system(s) and a C4ISR system(s) to interact is identified.  Before proceeding directly to the application specific implementation, the developer should consult the TRM Sourcebook and User Guide.The Sourcebook should aid the developer with the initial analysis, by providing:Lexicon, context, rationale and goals – to set the stage for new users.References to existing implementations and use-cases, which allows the user to determine if new ground must be plowed.References and discussion that provide insight into issues such as a) status of interoperability standards and models, b) levels of fidelity and interoperability required for various applications, c) legacy, interim and upcoming architectures, d) differences and similarities between C4ISR and M&S requirements, and e) differences between U.S. and international military requirements.The Sourcebook also provides an introduction to the TRM FIG described in Section 4 of this paper.  The definitions, examples, and commentary provided should help the developer determine specific (but not detailed) interaction requirements.  This will ensure that broad categories of data and interactions are not missed during the initial analysis.The User Guide is intended to help the developer through the system design phase, by providing:A process for addressing interoperability issues.In-depth discussion of the issues touched on in the Sourcebook.A TRM FIG analysis example (Sections 3 and 5 of this paper).As it evolves, the User Guide will also include a description of current and near-term C4ISR/Sim interfaces (hardware links and software protocols), and a discussion of C4ISR/Sim data engineering issues (common databases, data management, data translation, data alignment).  Subject matter experts will also be identified.The final step in the process is a Use-Case Report.  The purpose of these reports is to provide feedback that can be incorporated into subsequent releases of the Sourcebook and User Guide.  They can take just about any form, including:Formal or written reports submitted to SISO [1].Papers presented at the biannual Simulation Interoperability Workshops.Informal written reports submitted to SISO.Emails to Sourcebook and User Guide authors or editors, and C4I Study Group and Forum Chairs.Exchanges on the SG-C4I Reflector.7.0 SummaryThis report provides a heuristic model for presentation of use-cases in the context of the TRM FIG, the C4I FOM, and the C4ISR Interoperability Lexicon.   The review of two previous use-case analyses shows that the information exchange categories of the TRM do correspond to interface exchange data of the use-case interfaces, and that the TRM FIG is a useful tool in helping to characterize transactions among systems and simulations.  However, the current analysis is based on only the two use cases reported to date.  It will only be through establishment of a comprehensive use-case history, through user feedback, that we will achieve a robust User Guide and the establishment of the TRM as a useful frame of reference.  This should include the development of a supporting C4ISR/Sim Interoperability TRM RFOM and a complete mapping of the RFOM entities to the TRM Information Exchange Categories. It is intended that the User Guide, as a living document, will grow with increased use-case analysis, and evolve to a more useful tool for supporting interface development.RecommendationsForm a C4ISR/Sim TRM Product Development Group (PDG) to establish the TRM as a SISO Reference ProductPut out a call for papers involving use-case analysis of the TRM to be reported at the Spring 2004 SIWEstablish a use history to facilitate development of the TRM into a useful frame of referencePublish a more comprehensive TRM User Guide when appropriate9.0  References[1]	Simulations Interoperability Standards Organization (SISO),  HYPERLINK "http://www.sisostds.org/" http://www.sisostds.org/[2]	Timian, D.
