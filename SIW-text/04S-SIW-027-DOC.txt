There is a constant drive to expand the utility of M&S through distributed simulations, federations, and other such initiatives as composability, High Level Architecture, and the Extensible Modeling and Simulation Framework (XMSF). The Department of Defense and commercial sectors' increased reliance on M&S has necessitated a method to provide documented proof of M&S credibility. Although the Navy has mandated M&S Verification, Validation, and Accreditation (VV&A) to provide this credibility, no single standard has been created to execute the documentation process.Clearly, this lack of coordination and consistency begs the development of a single, clear, standard method and repository to facilitate the execution of this mandate. The development of the Department of the Navy (DON) VV&A Documentation Tool (VDT) and VV&A Markup Language (VVML) seeks to fill this void by standardizing and streamlining the M&S VV&A documentation process. The web-enabled VDT not only stores VV&A documentation and its associated information in one repository, but also standardizes and expedites the documentation process through intuitive templates and inherent flexibility via the VVML base. This paper builds the case for a VV&A documentation standard and details the role that VVML and VDT play in the realization of standardization.1. IntroductionThe ever-increasing use of modeling and simulation (M&S) in global communications, education, business and defense defines the twenty-first century. Seemingly, all areas of everyday life rely on M&S to provide the world with greater capabilities at lower costs. It is not surprising then that the Department of the Navy (DON) has led the way in incorporating this highly diversified technology to provide a pervasive set of M&S tools for application by operational units and across the four pillars of naval M&S: operations and experimentation; training; acquisition; and analysis and assessment (SECNAVINST 5200.38A [1]).As M&S evolves into reuse, greater federations and distributed simulations, the need for a standardized means to prove the credibility and usability of M&S becomes more urgent.1.1 Background: Verification, Validation, and Accreditation (VV&A)DON issued a mandate for M&S VV&A (SECNAVINST 5200.40 [2] to address this need. The key focus of DON M&S VV&A is to present accurate and correct information to users so that they can make conscientious and informed decisions regarding the use of M&S. In the past, defacto accreditation, i.e., acceptance based solely upon past use of the M&S and not upon examination, was used due to the lack of M&S documentation. Because of the lack of a formalized VV&A documentation standard, the credibility of the M&S is generally unsubstantiated. However, as M&S is increasingly relied upon to make realistic representations of the “real world” as well as critical decisions with substantial risks, it is clear that “it has worked so far” no longer suffices. With such factors as the safety of human lives, reductions in costs, schedule and funding being dependent upon the accuracy of M&S, it is clear that VV&A must be accurate and consistent.The need for standardization of VV&A documentation is thus a formalized set of processes designed to ensure the safety, cost effectiveness, and reliability of M&S. To facilitate the execution of these processes, a VV&A framework and processes have been outlined and in the Department of the Navy Modeling and Simulation Verification, Validation, and Accreditation Implementation Handbook, Volume 1 VV&A Framework [3]. Thus, the vehicle for creating M&S credibility is set into motion through VV&A.1.2 Necessity: Standardized VV&A DocumentationAlthough VV&A creates the framework and processes required to ensure the credibility of M&S, VV&A may be considered an incomplete effort without structured documentation. VV&A documentation must address the concerns of the M&S user by demonstrating its credibility with solid evidence. In other words, VV&A documentation must build on the M&S requirements for use, design specifications, development processes and procedures, and reporting of the M&S assumptions, capabilities, and limitations. The efficacy of VV&A hinges upon its thoroughness and consistency.The simplest way to ensure this pedigree of VV&A is to standardize the documentation process. The Navy Modeling and Simulation Master Plan includes standards as one of the enablers to “promote the development and use of standards, in order to reduce M&S production costs, while enabling consistent and comprehensive representation” [4]. As mentioned above, although there is a need for standardization, but no one tool, template, or language exists to facilitate such standardization. Therefore, it is not surprising that the VV&A documentation process remains inefficient. By extension, the potential for legacy M&S reuse under such conditions has been heretofore hindered by the lack of consistent documentation and the research needed to assess the applicability of an M&S in question for the new user’s purpose.Credible and consistent VV&A documentation has remained elusive. Since hesitation to conduct VV&A continues despite a DON mandate and implementation guides, something further is still needed to activate and facilitate the VV&A documentation process. In an effort to capture the problem, the Navy collected data on VV&A implementation needs over the past several years. The dominant stumbling block has been the facilitation of its execution. VV&A implementers consistently indicated that the most difficult aspect of implementation was the initiation: who does what, when and where to start, what to do and how to do it, and how to bring about the structured management needed to produce precise, complete, and useful documentation that will support informed decisions. The fundamental problem is clear: implementation guidance alone cannot meet the needs of consistency and reuse. A concrete, tangible standard for reporting information that is easy to use is needed.1.3 Utility of VVML and VDT in VV&AThe clamor to simplify the documentation process with an intuitive format is the foundation for the creation of VV&A Markup Language (VVML). The evolution of the DON's effort to support VV&A documentation has brought several key, M&S-wide desiderata to light: the possibility of VV&A documentation standardization, the need to promote M&S reuse, and the need for easy, on-line VV&A collaboration. Richly structured VV&A processes are possible by utilizing the Extensible Markup Language (XML) to create universal access to M&S data. The VVML concept directly addresses these VV&A needs by leveraging the XML-based framework into a VV&A-specific language, thereby providing a bridge between M&S requirements, open source and web-enabled standards. Further, the execution of VVML in the VV&A Documentation Tool (VDT), with its intuitive templates and user interface, solves both the initial documentation and reuse standardization problems. The associated benefits of such a marriage are numerous: adaptability to changes in VV&A structure and data, portability to enable universal, web-enabled access to VV&A information; the capacity to link to the Navy M&S Resource Catalog [5]; and easy maintenance and reference.2. PurposeTo date, no standards specify what information, documentation, or format is required for M&S VV&A. However, observing the common needs of numerous M&S VV&A programs reveals that an efficacious and accommodating VV&A documentation process hinges on two key factors: a common documentation standard and a method by which to achieve this documentation. This paper will show that VVML provides the extensible language necessary to generate a common VV&A template and VDT provides a standard content and format for all VV&A implementation. Continued discussions, collaboration, and incorporation of M&S VV&A needs will only provide ever-greater utility of VVML and VDT.Thus, this paper argues the need and justification for a single M&S VV&A documentation standard; provides a walkthrough of the VVML concept and its application through the VDT; and delineates the evidence needed to place VVML and the VDT as considerations for M&S VV&A standards. By extension, the need for VVML and the VDT in the context of the DON’s emphasis on M&S reuse and future endeavors will be highlighted. VVML and the VDT will prove to be inextricably vital to the creation of a formal and consistent means to evaluate M&S and the creation of federations, distributed simulations, interoperable and composable M&S.This argument will be presented in three parts: the presentation of the VVML concept, its utility as facilitated by the VDT, and the justification for its consideration as the foundation for future standardization. Finally, the discussion will conclude with future VVML/VDT capabilities and areas for consideration by the VV&A community in expanding VVML/VDT utility.3. Revolution: Utility of VVML and VDTVVML and its application, the VDT, provide the standardization and flexibility needed to create consistency in VV&A documentation by leveraging XML and providing users with a physical and tangible object to guide them through the VV&A documentation process. VVML creates consistency with the DON mandate by paralleling its contextual structure to VV&A Handbook, Vol. 1 Draft [6] while the VDT creates VV&A metadata files to record the VV&A process and progress. For each M&S project a single metadata file is created that contains four related documents: the Accreditation Plan, Accreditation Report, Verification and Validation (V&V) Plan and V&V Report. The resulting VVML file establishes a searchable index that facilitates configuration management, requirements traceability and a host of other benefits that will be addressed in the body of this paper. The flexibility of this web-based language and tool can save time and money by uniformly delivering M&S projects for accreditation and creating searchable M&S documentation repositories for future reference.3.1 VDT: Implementers' Interface with VVMLVV&A implementers require a quick and efficacious means to understand and perform the VV&A process. The VDT fulfills this need by formatting the required documents directly from the VV&A template and creating a manageable VV&A task list. Correlation with the VV&A Handbook, Vol. 1 Draft [7] and the draft VV&A instruction [8] provides additional clarification of those sections that new VV&A implementers may not understand and facilitates the easy creation of the required plans and reports. Once the VV&A implementer familiarizes him/herself with the VDT template fields and creates a VV&A task list, the VVML supports the execution of these tasks by connecting all members involved in the M&S development and VV&A effort through a single collaborative documentation standard. The VDT captures the textual documentation within specific contexts defined by the VVML. The collection of VVML files is then stored in a single repository, such as the Navy M&S Resource Catalog [9], creating a valuable asset to the DON M&S community.This standardization of the VV&A documentation process may inherently make systems engineering and M&S development more formalized and rigorous. VVML adheres to the standard VV&A template for documentation by representing the required M&S VV&A information while the VDT uses VVML to surround the VV&A content. With the VDT portal, VV&A metadata can be captured for multiple projects and will be able to be linked with the catalog. Thus, VVML promotes project visibility and facilitates information exchange. This specialized portal and/or the catalog will provide a robust web interface for searching for specific VV&A criteria.4. Evolution: Creation and Development of VVML and VDTThe VDT’s first iteration was as a stand-alone Microsoft Access database, which evolved into the Versions 1 and 2 of the VDT developed by SPAWAR Systems Center Charleston. Multiple users tested Beta Version 1 and their comments were incorporated, as appropriate, in the final release. Numerous comments received called for collaboration and information-sharing utilities. The success of VDT hinges upon participation from various members within the program and organizational resources, both internal and external. Hence, responses to the utility and capabilities comments were addressed to several users including: OPNAV, Marine Corps, Navy and Army threat systems offices and other organizations.Strong consideration was also given to interoperability with the DON M&S Resource Catalog [10]. The catalog was created to promote M&S reuse by providing a centralized repository where a registered user can enter information about M&S. The linking and portability of XML can allow certain VDT fields to be directly linked to catalog and to populate the database with current information with the consent of the user. The VDT/catalog-posting automation will relieve VV&A implementers from having to manually re-enter this vital information. Archiving VV&A historical information that future users can access in the catalog facilitates the evaluation of existing M&S for reuse based on the VV&A documentation.4.1 VVML: MetadataMetadata can be stored as data; as well as a resource indicated as a URL, i.e.  HYPERLINK "http://www.navmsmo.navy.mil/" http://navmsmo.hq.navy.mil/; one resource may therefore contain information about itself and/or another resource. One goal of writing structured metadata is to include as much of the syntax and semantics such that maximum information can be acquired when referencing a metadata document. In the context of the catalog, structured content in the metadata is paramount to populating the database with useful information. To make this XML data interchange a reality, the establishment of a metadata standard is necessary so that its content conforms to VV&A policy and complies with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) XML Schema [11]. As the primary goal of the VVML is inherently to provide a framework for tracking VV&A activity, the source code in Figure 1 is provided to show the attribute tags used to track events:Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 1. XML Code segment4.2 VVML: Hyperlinks and XML Sub-languagesFurther supporting the use of XML and web-based applications as the basis for VV&A documentation standardization are hyperlinks, which provide a simple, yet powerful, means of linking documents. As such, VVML applies the XML Linking Language (XLink), XInclude and XPointer languages to facilitate the VVML role of Metadata Collector and future capabilities discussed later in this document. Because XLink allows more abstract linking than standard HTML, users can insert and move elements into XML documents with greater flexibility, the creation and description of links between resources becomes more robust. “XLink provides a framework for creating both basic unidirectional links and more complex linking structures[,] allow[ing] XML documents to assert linking relationships among more than two sources, associate Metadata with a link, and express links that reside in a location separate from the linked resources [12].” XML syntax is used to create structures that can describe both simple, unidirectional hyperlinks (similar to HTML) and more sophisticated links. XLink’s value to VVML and the VV&A practitioner is that it can include a wide array of documents. Audio, video, database data, training media, schedules, and even XML-enabled test results can thus be added to any VV&A document file. This will be particularly useful for regression testing by linking statistical applications directly to the VDT.While XLink is an XML-based language that specifies constructs for advancing linking in XML documents, XPointer is a non-XML language that allows the user to address the internal structures of XML documents by specifying link sources and targets [13]. The XPointer language can be used as the basis as a fragment identifier for any Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) reference. By definition, a URI is a series of characters used to differentiate names. URIs locate a resource whose Internet media type is one of text/xml, application/xml, text/xml-external-parsed-entity, or application/xml-external-parsed-entity [14]. The XPointer’s capacity to harness URI fragments allows the VDT to manage validation test parameters. In contrast, XLink allows the management of parameters such as schedule and cost. Using the XPointer specification, the VDT can reference test results pointing directly to another application by simply pointing to the URI of the application.Finally, the VVML incorporates the XInclude specification to provide the mechanism for organizing and capturing non-text data such as graphics, embedded objects or files. XInclude provides a link with the attribute value of embedded resources in documents generated by the VDT. Such links provide syntax independent of media type to indicate that a resource is to be embedded graphically within the display of the document [15]. This capability has far-reaching implications. For example, it can add the ability to link live schedule information or even model information directly from the M&S applications to the VV&A project file.5. Utility: Benefits and Limitations of the VDT/VVMLThe benefits of VVML and the VDT are numerous: from one-step standardization and aggregation to universal applicability. Further utility and expansion into the area of M&S scheduling and management covers only one feature that the VDT may hope to achieve in the future. However, it is also important to note the current limitations of VVML and the VDT, not only its benefits. As such, this section seeks to provide the road ahead as well as the status of VVML and the VDT’s utility.5.1 One-Step Standardization and AggregationThe main benefit of using the VDT over Microsoft Word® is that only the VDT facilitates standardized preparation of VV&A documentation and supports the aggregation of V&V information in M&S repositories, such as the Navy M&S Resource Catalog [16]. The result is similar to using tax-preparation software to fill in tax forms and file income tax return electronically. Both the preparer and the government easily achieve greater levels of consistency and efficiency by using this standardized method.The overall VDT process produces standardized representations that can be tailored to accommodate any VV&A project. Specifically, VVML is structured to provide the four documents articulated in the VV&A Handbook Vol. 1 Draft [17] in electronic form:Accreditation PlanV&V PlanAccreditation ReportV&V ReportThese four documents describe specific tasks and correlate to the VV&A process. These processes include:VV&A planningData V&VConceptual Model ValidationDesign VerificationImplementation VerificationResults ValidationVV&A reportingThus, the VDT and its VVML underlay form the only tool that not only creates standardized documentation, robust flexibility, and XML-based utility, but also ensures compliance with DON M&S mandates.5.2 Ease of Use and Universal ApplicationAs noted above, the Web-based VDT application utilizes XML to enable its underlying database to create an easily accessible user interface that supports DON VV&A mandates. The VDT is accessible from any browser and connects to a specialized website that serves the latest VDT version. The web interface supports multiple platforms to ease and assist the user to produce standardized VV&A documentation. In order to consistently fulfill this tall order; verify that all requirements are met; and ensure that any user, regardless of familiarization with the VV&A process, can easily accomplish all tasks, the VDT represents a tree of documentation headings with user directions and an edit window that accepts formatted text and pictures as depicted in Figure 2.Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 2. The VDT main window displays the content associated with the “System/Process Modeled” subject of the V&V Accreditation Plan.Additionally, the current iteration of the VDT interface is sufficient to represent all M&S acquired, developed, managed, and used by DON activities. The fact that all categories of M&S used by DON activities (including live, virtual, and constructive simulations; distributed simulations; federates and federations; emulators; prototypes, simulators; and stimulators) can harness this tool with relative ease with little additional effort is in itself a revolution in M&S VV&A documentation. In the increasingly demanding world of M&S management, the importance of the VDT for project developers, system engineers, system architects, testers, and management attempting to balance their traditional responsibilities, challenging schedules, and tight budgets with the new demands of M&S VV&A can hardly be understated.As discussed earlier, the VDT creates each report separately by user request to the format prescribed by the document templates. For easier access and standard formatting, VV&A project content is sequentially placed between indexed documentation headers while maintaining the user-supplied formatting intact. Each report is then generated and can be previewed using the universally recognizable “Print Preview” menu selection. The “Print” menu selection generates and sends a standardized report to the specified printer. The following is an example of the Print Preview window.Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 3. Standard Print Preview window5.3 Current VDT LimitationsThe VDT directly manages the VVML structure and document content to the new VV&A documentation standard. Because the VDT can include “cut-and-paste” data from other editors and tools, the VDT promotes sharing of information from various reference materials.  Like most tools, the VDT is bounded by it’s own limitations and certainly not an all inclusive tool.  The features such as cost, schedule, and risk computation still need to be developed.    We are investigating technologies that will best afford an integration and incorporation of these features.  Additionally, the collaborative capabilities afford by web technology is being also being investigated.  Currently, the collaboration is limited to by the accessibility of data.  In other words, a single user can access the data at any given time.  This feature is also being investigated so that multiple users can collaborate and share the same data at any given time.   There are other limitation and additional research is required.  Some known issues include:Dependent on Web connectivityThe addition of a spell check featureThe capacity to add a table of contents, page numbers, and indexesBinary representation of images that occupy less disk space that XML-wrapped rich text5.4 Tailoring of V&VPerceptions of the VV&A process are that it is exhaustive and costly. Poorly planned VV&A may fall into those categories. Therefore, it is suggested that this judgment process be conducted using common sense, sound business management practices, and be considerate of time and resources efficiencies. Organizations can adhere and comply with instructions to do VV&A, follow the guidelines, and produce meaningful VV&A documentation efficiently with the use of the VDT. Documentation content is the sole responsibility of VV&A practitioners. As such, portions of the VV&A content may be left blank, resulting in abridged VV&A reports.Although this may not be limitation of the VDT, it is included in this section in order to clear the understanding that VDT does not conduct tailoring of VV&A.  It is the user who uses the tool with foresight, knowledge, and understanding of M&S requirements that allows the tailoring.  The tool is only a mechanism to impart this knowledge in a template format.6. Future Capabilities6.1 Flexibility and Additional FunctionalityThe release of a new standard for Navy VV&A documentation clarifies, characterizes, and evolves the VV&A process. In synergy with this evolution, VVML emerges as the single standard to represent VV&A project artifacts. Because VVML is a language that can easily adapt to future requirements and evolving VV&A methods, software development, and VV&A process maturity, higher levels of validation categorization and new means of requirements traceability can be established and standardized through the VDT. VVML also has the capacity to adapt to additional XML tags. VVML extensions open new possibilities to represent complex relationships between M&S components. Often expensive, proprietary tools appear to fill the current void. However, continued improvements to the VDT will extend and improve the management of the VV&A process, including:Monitor and measure VV&A activities and progressProvide essential feedback regarding the organization of VV&A activities within the M&S lifecycleCollect and summarize lessons learned to extrapolate possible improvements to future VV&A processes and standardsExpand data import and export methods including requirements traceability matrixes and other tool matrixes.6.2 VDT Support Web-Centricity and Streamlined SchedulesWith regard to the DON’s emerging web-centric approach, the VDT application has the possibility of improving the management of VV&A processes by providing timely visibility of progress, audits, summary analysis, and judgments of credibility. By using the VDT, M&S managers can coordinate their efforts to respond to critical issues of performance and effectiveness, thereby streamlining the effort to quantify and mitigate risks. Future versions of the VDT will manage a template that extends for each of the project components. After the VV&A process is tailored to fit the project, a schedule can be created that associates VV&A activities and time with costs. Thus, the VDT has the potential to quantify and track costs. This functionality will help evaluate project risk as a relationship to historical, budgeted and projected costs.As the VDT suggests a roadmap for the direction and completeness of the documentation based on the stage of the M&S development cycle, the VDT can evolve to promote each specific V&V process stage. The VV&A calendar can be used as a simplified resource planner to organize high-level tasks. As a web-accessible tool, the VDT can support a standardized process to efficiently capture and share VV&A data for streamlined documentation and collaboration while VV&A activities are audited throughout the execution. Hence, the VDT emerges from a documentation template program to a full service VV&A assistant that supports an organization’s advance into process maturity.The VDT organizes VV&A information that identifies how the M&S project can sufficiently execute VV&A and meet acceptability criteria. When actual results of V&V testing are available, M&S management gains a cohesive understanding of the M&S progress by tapping into this rich resource, thus casting away the vagueness and opacity so often noted as a frustration of VV&A. With such openness and clarity, the acceleration of the overall M&S schedule is likely as developers will be able to identify and focus on higher-priority tasks which directly relate to the most important M&S acceptability criteria. Because VVML has the capability to conjoin system-level tests with expected results, the applications of VVML in the VDT can be expanded ad infinitum to create and maintain a matrix of relationships that represent the acceptability criteria and the status of system-level tests and analysis.6.3 ComposabilityThe capacity for any one standardized template to be deployed without knowledge of the M&S developer’s methodology (e.g., fast-prototyping, functional decomposition, or object-oriented) has been noted during the VDT development effort. By encapsulating the details that VVML uses to represent a structure of data, models, and simulation component documentation in the extensive template framework, documentation interoperability can be substantively evolved via VVML generation and links.  Composability is the capability to select and assemble various combinations to satisfy specific user requirements meaningfully. A defining characteristic of composability is the ability to combine and recombine components into different systems for different purposes.  VVML supports the definition of  composability by providing an environment where dynamic interaction and interchange of information exchange is required to develop a formidable VV&A documentation.   A concerted effort by the XMSF Group [18] promotes the concept of composable components. To arrange and compose new M&S projects and configurations, M&S will require consistent and standardized nomenclature, high-level descriptions, and the designation of each M&S specific solution. It is important to note that although VVML is designed to support associations in the VV&A documentation, certain sections of VV&A documentation describe unique qualities: system components and their associated requirements, acceptability criteria, assumptions, capabilities, limitations, and test results. Those who would compose an M&S need a strong understanding of the various implementation techniques and their purposes. In such circumstances, there may be no better representation of the documented, analyzed, and approved M&S, than the project’s VVML file.6.4 M&S Reuse and Cost SavingsThe consistent use of the VDT and VVML directly aids in effort to reuse M&S by standardizing original VV&A documentation for ready accessible reference and possibly reducing the cost of doing VV&A for legacy M&S. VV&A documents provide a concrete, value-added deliverable that benefits the entire M&S community. The users who evaluate M&S for reuse will not only have easily accessible and consistent VV&A documentation, but also access to the original validation test results and expected outcomes all in one file, thus streamlining future efforts to understand legacy M&S performance and capabilities.7. SummaryThe Navy Simulation Baseline Assessment [19] for FY02 provides an annual of M&S expenditure for the Navy in the areas of training and education, operations and experimentations, acquisitions, assessment, and management, science, and technology. With much riding on the line, the standardization of VV&A documentation is no longer a nicety; it is a necessity. VVML and its implementation via the VDT specifically address this exigency by developing a single VV&A documentation standard. Together, VVML and the VDT streamline VV&A by automatically generating standardized documentation and saving the information as constant VVML files. VVML provides a specialized XML-based language to create a unique DON VV&A documentation template. The VDT dynamically applies VVML to aggregate the VV&A content. It is the VDT’s use of VVML that solidifies a solution that aggregates the VV&A documentation process and provides a more meaningful representation of VV&A information. As the foundation of VVML is the highly malleable XML, future growth in addressing the growing demands of M&S VV&A, its management, and processes and flexibility is virtually limitless. VVML, the foundation of the VDT, may lead to advancements in how VV&A results are composed, organized, distributed, searched, shared, and reused.8.
