Let’s make sure we do not schedule anyone back to back in the future; at least a 30 minute break is recommended.Transfer of control between federates continues to be a growing area of interest for the forum.One presentation recommended that SISO look into providing standards for the use of avionics equipment and software in flight simulators. VWS will explore this further with the author to see if a study group should be considered.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)025Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)030Peak attendance (including joint sessions)060Total papers presented12 (14 with Joint)“No-show” presentations0Other presentations and panel discussions0Recommended Reading List nominations (including previous nominations):04S-SIW-08204S-SIW-13204S-SIW-079
