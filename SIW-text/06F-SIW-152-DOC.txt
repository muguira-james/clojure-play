Name of Forum or Group:  Analysis ForumChairCam TranVice ChairEmmet BeekerSecretaryJohn FayObjectives for this Workshop:Discuss recent developments in network-centric operations and architectures as spearheaded by service oriented architectures (SOAs) and, in particular, Web services.Explore new techniques and practices of Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis (MS&A) as well as formal specification approaches and tools to relate missions and resources, simulation results and requirements.Familiarize the audience (in particular, ANL Forum) with the theme (“Human Behavior Representation in Modeling and Simulation”) of the workshop.Comments and Recommendations:Paper 06F-SIW-013 provides a recommended guide for tailoring the DoD Architecture Framework (DoDAF) for Service Oriented Architectures (SOAs) and illustrates with an example.  Paper 06F-SIW-036 presents an architectural overview of shared data services as Web services in support of communications and network modeling, simulation, and analysis (MS&A) together with potentials, challenges, and feasible options.  The paper also provides key aspects of shared data services in support of MS&A in general.Network MS&A is the central theme of 06F-SIW-021 and 06F-SIW-017; network testing and analysis is the main focus of the Invited Presentation “USAF Distributed Missions Operations Latency Testing”.  Paper 06F-SIW-070 explores the novel use of federation of Map Aware Non-uniform Automata (MANA) to expand the area of simulation.  Paper 06F-SIW-099 pushes the Missions and Means Framework (MMF) forward from the previously developed conceptual model to a logical data model. Paper 06F-SIW-048 presents an overview of an attempt to develop mechanisms and tools to link simulation results and analyst requirements.Three papers 06F-SIW-026, 06F-SIW-063, and 06F-SIW-074 are of interest to Human Behavior Representation.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)21Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)30Peak attendance (including joint sessions)76Total papers presented14“No-show” presentationsNoneOther presentations and panel discussionsOne (1) Invited PresentationRecommended Reading List nomination: 06F-SIW-036 presents a high-level architecture of shared data services as Web services to support communications and network MS&A, identifies potentials, challenges, and feasible solutions, as well as key aspects of shared data services in support of MS&A in general.06F-SIW-021 provides an overview of network MS&A in support of the One Tactical Engagement Simulation System (OneTESS) with emphasis on lessons learned concerning technological risks associated with bandwidth, latency, reliability, engagement adjudication and data collection.                 2006 FALL SIW OUTBRIEF FORM
