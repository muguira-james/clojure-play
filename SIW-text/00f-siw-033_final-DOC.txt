IntroductionThis paper describes a product development model that could form a basis for discussion of the economic benefits of simulation.  The context of this paper considers a product development program from concept through retirement, where simulation may be used to reduce life-cycle costs.  The benefits of simulation in the following product life-cycle areas are explored: 1) event replacement, that is using a simulation to replace a particular test or other activity, 2) product improvement, such as using simulation to improve a manufacturing process, and 3) evaluation of alternate designs during development using simulations.  Although there are other implications, they are not considered in this paper. Military weapon system programs strongly influenced the decisions in the development of these equations.  However, the authors were uncomfortable with placing an economic value on military issues such as time-to-deployment.  This led to using commercial product development terms and explanations.  Many of the concepts presented are applicable to military weapon system programs but the reader is left to assess the degree of applicability.The equations developed describe the economics at two levels.  The first is at the level of the entity investing in a new product for sale, called the investor level.  At this level, only economic elements that are likely to be affected by simulation used in product development are considered.  The overall profitability and investment policies of the company are not considered.  The elements-of-interest at this level are profit from product revenue and product development costs, which include simulation costs.   The intent of the first level is to show economic impact in terms of conventional accounting using elements that can be found in product introduction plans, capital budgets, profit and loss statements, and balance sheets. The second economic level addresses effects on the first level elements-of-interest that occur when instituting the next increment of the use of simulation.  The assumption is that simulation(s) may be introduced into the product life cycle at any point or incrementally.   Only the costs or benefit of the next increment of simulation being considered are estimated.  This second level or next increment is referred to as the simulation being planned. Both the adverse effects of failure in using simulation as well as the benefits of success are included.Finally, hypothetical examples are given to demonstrate the effects and potential cost benefits of simulation at various stages of the life cycle of the product. 2.0 The Investor Level Equations (first level)The elements-of-interest at the first or investor level are:Profit from product revenue ().  This includes profit in the profit & loss sense and recovery via depreciation of the capitalized costs of the product development.Product development investmentFunds ().  This is the cash flowing into the product development either from the capital budget or from current year profits and overhead.  Product development and product sales occur over a period of months.  The period starts with month 0 and ends with month n.  New product development starts at month 0.  The product goes to market (is deployed) in month  and the product is no longer viable for sale at month n.   This is the essence of the economic model that this paper addresses, i.e.t:= 0,1,.. s,.. n2.1 Profit from product revenueProfit from product revenue starts at month s and stops at month n.  Month s depends on when the product is ready for sale.  Month n is fixed to the calendar by external market conditions.  There is a product introduction planned at month s and profit from revenue, Rt for each month out to n.  Profit from product revenues are zero prior to month s.  This plan is an array of monthly values or a function that produces Rt values for each month as a function of t.R(t) := R0.. Rs.. RnThe total life-cycle profit from product revenue can be written as                 (2)It is assumed that the market size for this product is not fixed in that profit from product revenue could increase by getting to market earlier and by increasing monthly profit, Rt, through lower production costs and better customer acceptance.2.2 Product development investmentProduct development investment starts at month 0 and continues through the month prior to the month when the product goes to market.  For this model, at month s the new product development project is over and product development investment stops.   There is a product development plan that includes all increments of accepted simulation usage, costs, and benefits, as well as all other development costs, but not the costs or benefits of the current simulation being planned.  This plan is an array of monthly product development investments.I(t) := I0.. Is.. InThe total development costs can be written as          (3)2.3 Effects of Simulation at the Investor LevelFigure 1 illustrates the effects on development costs and profits caused by changes in the month that the product goes to market. Figure 1Some uses of simulation are aimed at reducing s; that is, market introduction is made earlier.  If month s moves to the left, there is more profit from product revenue, R.  Conversely, some uses of simulation increase s, that is, the product introduction to the market may be delayed.  If product introduction is later, the profit from product revenue for the missed months is assumed to be lost.  Also, if s moves to the right, then product development investment increases in that the investment must continue to be made each month that the product continues to be developed.The use of simulation may also decrease I or increase R independent of the time-to-market changes.Some uses of simulation are aimed at reducing , that is, market introduction is made earlier.  If month  moves to the left, there is more profit from product revenue.  Conversely, some uses of simulation have the potential for increasing by increasing product quality or utility, or by improving the time to market.  If product introduction is later, the profit from product revenue for the missed months is assumed to be lost.Some uses of simulation are aimed at reducing the product development investment (), which would increase the overall cost benefit.  However, if  moves to the right, then  increases in that the investment must continue to be made each month that product entry is delayed.3.0 Costs and Benefits of the Simulation being planned (second level) The simulation being planned is paid for by the new investment required for the development and operation of a simulation intended to reduce product development costs or increase profits.  The total cost of the simulation being planned is defined as S.For the simulation being planned, the cost benefit equation development follows these guidelines:Variables and terms are easily identifiable with the product development project.Variables of interest for concepts such as cost-as-an-independent variable can be easily solved.  Partial derivatives can be computed for any variable.Where more elaborate functions are needed, they may be substituted for variables in the equations.New costs and benefit terms can be added to those described here.The net benefit to be realized by the simulation increment being planned is B.3.1 Simulation Savings due to Replacement of Program EventsSimulation may be used to replace tests, mockups, etc.  These are treated as events that represent potential savings if replaced by simulation.  A surface to air missile might be tested throughout the envelope of required operation.  Alternatively, some or all of the tests might be replaced by simulation.   The benefits associated with event replacement come from; first, savings directly associated with the event itself and, second, with a reduction in time to market.  A third benefit is the reduction in risk associated with the events that use simulation but are not replaced by simulation.  This third benefit is not discussed in this paper.  Assessment of the value of this risk reduction is a good topic for another paper.These variables are used in the event replacement term:	 the reduction in  associated with replacing events by the simulation being planned.  Events that must occur because of technical, contract, or demonstration requirements are not included.   	the fraction of P that will be realized with the simulation being planned (0<=p<=1).	The reduction in time-to-market to be realized by event replacement with the simulation being plannedThe event replacement benefit($) term will then be        (4)3.2 Simulation Savings due to Project Length Reduction from Faster Alternative EvaluationSimulation is used to evaluate alternative designs during concept and engineering development phases.  The savings show up as reduced time required for evaluating design alternatives that would have been evaluated more slowly.  This might be thought of as speeding up the design rejection rate.  Not included in this term is the use of simulation to improve product performance or quality by evaluating more alternatives.  This is covered under product improvement.An additional variable needed for the alternative evaluation term is:	The time-to-market reduction to be achieved by faster alternative evaluation with the simulation being planned (number of months)The faster alternative evaluation benefit term ($) is then              (5)3.3 Product Improvement Opportunity TermSimulation may be used to improve product quality and performance.  These opportunities are usually associated with evaluating more design alternatives and evaluating alternatives to a greater depth of detail.  For example, better quality can be achieved by more detailed simulation of alternative manufacturing processes and more detailed evaluation of maintenance procedures.  Better performance may be achieved by evaluating more design alternatives.  However, evaluating more design alternatives is assumed to make time-to-market later.The following additional variables are needed for the product improvement term:	the value of product improvements, increases in , that potentially could be realized by simulation  	the portion of M expected to be achieved in product improvements by the simulation being planned (0<=m<=1)r	the number of months that would be added to the project time s by the planned simulation for product improvementThe product improvement benefit term is then         (6)3.4 The Equation of net Benefits (B)Three of the cost and benefit terms defined above include summations over profit from product sales and product investment.  When combining these terms in a single equation, simply adding them would cause some double counting of benefits.  That is, the profit or investment for a single month would possibly be added more than once.  A more correct combination would be to group all the variables that affect the shift in market entry s and use a single summation term.The equation of net benefits for the simulation being planned is given by combing terms above using a single summation term.       (7)If we assume that monthly values of R(t)  and I(t) are closely represented by Rs and Is  for months close to month s, then equation (7) may be written as:     (8)4.0 A look at the end conditionsFor the case where no simulation is planned, used, or implemented, the cost of building and using the simulation is zero, the number of months of project time decrease and increase are zero, and the benefit realization variables are zero.  For this case, net benefits are zero.B=0              (9)For the case where the simulation is planned and implemented but no benefits are realized the realization variables p, m, k, and g are zero and r and S are their estimated values.             (10)For the case where the simulation is planned, implemented, and used and all potential benefits are realized, the realization variables are 1.0.         (11)5.0 A Hypothetical ExampleThe project is to design a new consumer product, CP.  The vendor is the manufacturer, designer, and the seller of CP. Customer savings in training and maintenance are assumed to benefit the vendor by an amount equal to the customer benefit.  This customer benefit represents increased quality and tends to increase market share and total value.The vendor has an integrated set of simulations that can be modified to represent the functions of CP, its maintenance, and training.  This modification will cost S1.  This set of simulations will be used in the design phase to reduce the iteration time for each design (g months).  Approximately half of this time saving will be used to run additional cases that will improve quality, maintainability, and training (M).  The simulation set will also be used to reduce the number of tests needed to qualify CP for its range of operation.  This substitution of simulation for tests will reduce the project time k months.  The simulation set will be modified to meet this requirement.  This modification will cost S2.CP is to replace a competitive product.  CP will sell at a lower price than the competitive product and will contain all the newest technology.   Each month of delay in CP introduction is costing the vendor $100K in profit from product revenue.  In addition, the investment associated with the product development is costing $100K per month of development time.The values for the input variables are given below.  Dollar ($) values are in thousands:Costs of modifying  the simulation set:Monthly cost:Rs = 100, monthly profit from product revenue.Is = 100, monthly product development investmentCosts and savings estimates due to event replacement:P =200, potential reduction in development costsp = 0.6, fraction of P expected to be realized k = 2, reduction in time-to-marketEstimates of Costs and savings due to product improvement:Project length arguments:M = 300, potential increase in profit from product revenuem = 0.6, fraction of M expected to be realizedr = 1, product entry delay caused by product improvement simulationCosts and savings estimates due to faster alternative evaluation:g =2, reduction in time-to-marketEstimates of benefit realization arguments:The nNet benefits to be realized are         (12)And, the new product entry date is 3 months sooner.A note on the example:  A four-month time-to-market delay would wipe out all the $750K of planned benefits.  The total simulation development costs is $150K while a month’s delay costs $200K in product development costs and product sales losses.  If the simulation development is on the critical path, the simulation alone represents a development risk each month of more than its total development costs. 6.0 ConclusionA mathematical model is presented in two levels.  The first level takes the view of the entity making the product development investment and which will receive the benefit of that investment.  This investment level model contains three variables:The product development investment (I)The investment recovery and profit from product sales (R)The time-to-market for the product (s)The second level model relates trade study variables to the investor model for a next increment of simulation use being planned.  The trade study level results are expressed in a single equation that gives net benefit effect on the variables in the investor model.The equations developed can be used to demonstrate the benefit for a project of using of simulation savings to:Reduce investment costShorten time-to-marketImprove product quality Reduce manufacturing costsThe reduction in benefits from a delay in time-to-market is included.The equation development guidelines set forth in the introduction were met; the most important of these being the ability to find input argument values in conventional project and accounting practice.Author BiographiesREUBEN S.
