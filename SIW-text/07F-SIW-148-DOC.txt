Given the DoD management changes that are ongoing, it is recommended that SISO consider inviting M&S steering committee and/or future M&S coordination agents to the Spring SIW. These M&S agents align well with the SIW forums of Acquisition (SMAS), Analysis, Test, and Training.2. The FCS program has initiated the integration of the Federation Development Process with the overall System Engineering Process. One of the major points they recommend is that the federation be treated as a deliverable and “first class object” in SBA programs.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)21Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)30Peak attendance (including joint sessions)30Total papers presented10“No-show” presentations0Other presentations and panel discussions0Recommended Reading List nomination:  48, 83                 2007 FALL SIW OUTBRIEF FORM
