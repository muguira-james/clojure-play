Common Image Generator Interface Study GroupChairRonald G. MooreVice ChairWillard B. PhelpsSecretaryMichael ButterworthObjectives for this Workshop:Brief the Common Image Generator Interface (CIGI) Survey of Interest resultsDetermine the next step for the CIGI groupComplete the study, and close the study groupComments and Recommendations:The CIGI community is very small.  There is good industry interest and the government is very supportive.In general, it is felt that the cost to create a SISO, IEEE or ISO image generator interface standard will be more costly than it is worth.  That is, based on the cost to reintegrate a new image generator, and the number of times reintegration will be required, compared to the support (time and money) required to develop a standard, the standard will not be cost effective.The Open Source community will be pursued as the model that best fits the CIGI community’s needs!A CIGI Open Source Community of Interest (COI) will be formed to oversee the development of the CIGI Interface Control Document (ICD) and the Open Source code.  Membership and voting methods will be based on SISO current process and procedures.All CIGI COI members will contribute to the ICD and Open Source developmentCompliance to the CIGI ICD will be accomplished per program.  The CIGI COI will address conflicts and issues.SISO will be asked to host the CIGI Open Source Community of Interest bi-yearly meetings.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)10Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)14Peak attendance (including joint sessions)14Total papers presented0“No-show” presentationsn/aOther presentations and panel discussions2Recommended Reading List nominations (including previous nominations): N/A
