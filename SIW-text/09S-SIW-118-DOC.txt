SISO feature in the next or a future SIW, the concept of: M&S  Integrated With Real-Time Military Operations.  Our forum will be happy to assist in framing this.  The idea would be to show how M&S, its tools and technologies; can contribute to, and have direct military utility for, military operations. This would be unique, direct, ways M&S can benefit the Warfighter in conducting his or her mission, in a real-time decision support and IT capability role,  rather than the traditional non-real time analysis, planning and training functions.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)32Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)44Peak attendance (including joint sessions)?Total papers presented12“No-show” presentations0Other presentations and panel discussions4Recommended Reading List nomination:   09S-SIW-027               2009 SPRING - OUTBRIEF
