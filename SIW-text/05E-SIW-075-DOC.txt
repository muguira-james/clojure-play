scenario development tools have been non-standard and closely coupled to the simulation they support. This close coupling severely limits third party tool development and sharing of scenarios among simulations and between simulations and C4I devices. The final report of the recently completed Assessment of the Need for Product Data Representation Standards (ANDPDRS) SG identified “Campaign/Mission Scenario Data Presentations” as a simulation standards gap and nominated the MSDL effort as a possible solution. The Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization (SISO) has approved the Terms of Reference for organizing the Military Scenario Definition Language Study Group. The kickoff meeting was held at the SISO Spring 2005 Workshop to elect the officers of the Study Group and convey the intents of developing the standards for Military Scenario Definition Language to the M&S community. The Study Group was officially recognized on April 29, 2005. Currently there are more than 100 subscribers to the Study Group reflector. See annex B for the list of subscribers.PurposeThis progress report documents the Study Group activities from its formation at the Spring 2005 Workshop to the Euro 2005 Workshop. The findings and status of the tasks are also recorded in this report.ScopeThe Study Group targets to complete tasks 1, 2 and 3 that are defined in the Terms of Reference. First, it has reached the community and gathered the inputs, comments that can be used to define the requirements for the MSDL standards. Second, the collaboration with Coalition Battle Management Language (C-BML) effort is also progressing to assure the similarities are identified and assigned appropriately, thus avoid the overlapping of efforts and conflicting standards. Third, the results of the first and second tasks were used to produce this progress report and the Table of Contents for the final report. Also the collected requirements have been continuously evaluated to prepare for the standard specifications development.ObjectivesThe two main objectives to be accomplished for the Euro 2005 Workshop by the Study Group are producing the Table of Contents for the final report and the production of this. The remaining objectives that are defined in the TOR are to be accomplished for the Fall 2005 Workshop in September.Intended AudiencesThis document is intended for the Modeling & Simulation community.References	SISO References:Document NumberTitle1SISO-ADM-005-2004Policy for: The Style and Format of SISO documents2SISO-SG-TOR-MSDL_2005-04-06MSDL Study Group Terms of Reference 3SISO-ADM-003-2002SISO Balloted Products Development Process (BPDP)4SISO-ADM-002-2003SISO Policies and Procedures (P&P)Other References:Document NumberTitle1FM 7-15, 15 August 2003Army Universal Task List (AUTL)2CJCSM 3500.04C, 1 July 2002Universal Joint Task List (UJTL), version 4.23XML Schemahttp://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchemaDefinitionsArmy Universal Task List	The Army Universal Task List is the comprehensive listing of Army tactical-level collective tasks.

Present the final report.Requirements SolicitationThe first task of the Study Group is harvesting the requirements from the community to understand the needs of the community. The requirements solicitation was begun with the usage of the OneSAF Objective System’s MSDL schema as the starting point. The package was prepared and distributed to the Study Group reflector on 3 May 2005.  This package contains the MSDL schemas and documentation, the MSDL Overview presentation by Jeff Abbott, the MSDL Collaboration presentation by Dr. Robert Wittman, the OOS MSDL specifications document that describes the MSDL schema structure. The inputs and comments from the community were requested and collected for discussion at the face-to-face working session on 8-10 June 2005 in Orlando, Florida. Inputs and CommentsA spreadsheet was created to capture the raw inputs and comments from the community via the emails, reflector and meetings. The inputs and comments were either discussed at the face-to-face meeting, or via reflector and emails, or at the teleconference meeting to seek consensus of the community that they can be accepted as the requirements for MSDL standard specifications. The table below shows the to-date collection of the inputs and comments that were evaluated and accepted by the community as the requirements for the standard specifications development:Comment #Inputs/CommentsComment SourceComment TypeRecommended SolutionDomain1Is the final version of the "Specification for: Military Scenario Definition Language" document intended to be a product of the Study Group or of the Product Development Group?SpecificationThe specifications for standards development will be developed by the Study Group. The draft standards will be developed by the PDG when we move from SG to PDG. We are putting this initial draft specification out to solicit comments and provide the basis for conversation and collaborations.2Is the scenario definition language to be used in the other domains than military (some of the applications are used to simulate purely civil environment)?SpecificationMSDL is the Military Scenario Definition Language. As such, we are focusing it on the military domain, not the general simulation domain.  Aspects of the civilian domain that impact military operations may be represented as appropriate, and it is possible that the representation of non-military functionality could be added during subsequent versions of the specification.3If MSDL can be used in the civil environment, here are some possible guidelines:- Impact on the use of the standard in other domain must be taken into consideration.- The  structure and organization of the scenario definition language should be documented as generic (non-military) in its own document.- The purely military domain portions should be in their own specific documents.- The purely civil domain portions should be in their own specific documents.SpecificationComments will not be applicable if MSDL is for military simulation only.4Is this standard destined to become an international standard? If so here are some possible guidelines:- Precedence should be give to the use of international or recognized as international standard (ISO, IEEE, SISO and NATO). Mapping from the international standard to some of the country specific standards could be included as recommendation. Country specific standards could also be revised and promoted to become SISO standards.- The principle behind the standard should be neutral when defining elements and relationships.Specification5Definition Correction: In the MSDL_Specifications_InitialDraft.doc document, page 3, in the "Acronyms and Abbreviations" section, METOC is defined as "Metrological" instead of "Meteorology & Oceanography"Wayne Smith - wayne.r.smith@erdc.army.milLanguageWill be corrected at the time the document is updated for Euro 05 SIW. The update version to be posted to WebBoard by 6/27/056Potential requirements to extend MSDL XML Schema to include ABCS network data for both OOS and the C4I adapter.1) January, ARL:UT provided to OOS PM recommended schema extensions for ABCS network data 2) March, ARL:UT provided an XML data file based on the MSDL XML schema with UTO and network for the 1st CAV DIV (ABCS 6.3.6) that was generated by ACSIS tool. 3) The ACSIS database includes detailed data about an exercise-specific UTO and its associated ABCS/FBCB2/BFT network data to initialize/synchronize both ABCS and simulations. The ACSIS database includes many detailed network configuration and addressing data elements. We attempted to select the data elements required by the simulation itself and the C4I Adapter based on past meetings and discussions with PM OOS and to extend the MSDL XML schema based on the appropriate "business rules" used in ABCS version 6.3.6 & 6.4 If changes or additions to these network data element extensions are required, we are ready to support.4) We would also like to discuss other issues related to the UTO based on the DoD Global Force Management (GFM) initiative (GFMIEDM) and the Army Force Management System (PEO EIS FMS) program.  The ACSIS database currently assigns Enterprise-wide Identifiers (EwIDs) to Army organizations (units) and these new initiatives will also assign EwIDs to platforms, equipment, crews, and personnel billets.5) The DoD and Army Net-Centric Data Strategy is very important to both C4I systems and simulations and their interfaces (C4I Adapters) for training, testing, mission planning, COA analysis, and mission rehearsal purposes.  I think that MSDL requirements related to SIM-C4I should be addressed by this Study Group, perhaps as a sub-group (focus group) with the objective to add appropriate C4I network (ABCS and other service C4I) data elements to the MSDL Specification.ARL:UTC4I AdapterOngoing work will look at generalizing the representation of battle command so that it can be used for other nations, other services, and other doctrines.Army7The report from the Fidelity Implementation Study Group contains the long discussion on resolution. It also contains a very large set of definitions that includes some that are on our list. The document is 99S-SIW--167. We should probably start from thoseFrancois Gagnon - gagnonf@cae.com1. By Robert Wittman - rwittman@mitre.orgGreat idea, we referenced that paper early on for OOS level definitions and will use here again.All8Base Object Model (BOM), which is an XML-based standard being developed within SISO may be a good fit for MSDL collaboration. There are some elements of the BOM standard related to the conceptual model space in identifying patterns of interplay and states that can correlate with a scenario description. - BML focuses on the description of executable tasks and assigning these to militiary entities- MSDL targets the initialization of simulation systems with the military scenario.- MSDL allows the generation of the military scenario that consists of the initial state of the military situation and planned actions.- BOM allows the identification of what conceptual entities and events are to be at play and the common activities (called actions) that occur among them, and then allows the object models that can be used to support those conceptual entities and events to be mapped and identified (using HLA constructs)- The conceptual entities and events that are identified in the BOM could be mapped to elements of the scenario description identified within the MSDL, and conversely, the scenario description within a MSDL document could reference BOMs that support the scenario, which could effectively allow support for an executable conceptual model.Paul Gustavson will provide brief overviewGeneral9Is the "IsDeaggregateOnDisplay" flag for a unit used when displaying only?UnitThe "IsDeaggregatedOnDisplay" flag is used to determine if a unit icon is to be displayed.10If so (comment # 9), what happens when there are multiple displays? Does a change in one display affect the other displays or does each display have their own value?UnitThat is not the intent. The intent is to maintain a consistent display of units and overlays when an MSDL scenario is exported from one system and loaded into another. MSDL was implemented for scenario inter-change. Currently, how an MSDL compliant application makes use of the underlying MSDL data run-time is left to each application. Since, MSDL does not constraint how an application operates, it could be used as suggested (either way).11Statement: "Currently, how an MSDL compliant application makes use of the underlying MSDL data run-time is left to each application."If the underlying use is left to each application, how can we guarantee that the common scenario as defined by the MSDL standard produces "identical" behavior for each application? If the data is treated differently, we loose the entire purpose for the convenience of a standard to supply cross-application inputs of a common scenario and validation of consistent treatment for the behavior/performance scripts contained in the scenario.Addition to comments 9 & 101) We can never guarantee that the scenario will behave in the same way in all simulations. Every simulation implements behaviors, physical models, etc. in different ways. The purpose of MSDL is to ensure that all importing simulations are initialized with the same data: order of battle, locations, comms networks (eventually), tasks(eventually), etc. Fair fight and other issues have to be resolved through other mechanism.2) Clarification for recommended solution to comment #10: MSDL was not intended to specify "how" an application works. MSDL was intended to specify 'what' military scenario data is to be interchanged. So, from that perspective, the Is DeaggregatedOnDisplay elements was intended to provide a mechanism for specifying the common operating picture (COP) to be interchanged. How multiple displays are used to view the COP of a scenario that is 'in progress' (under development or simulating is up to the application side. MSDL simply ensures the COP can be saved as part of the military scenario.3) Final resolution: propose the following information be included in the MSDL peer review spread sheet (was MATREX spreadsheet):* Parent Attribute Path (where is or to insert the attribute)* Attribute Name* Datatype (itself when is also a type)* Units (when applicable)* Cardinality (number, 0+, 1+, etc)* Layer (Core, Common, Custom)* Category (Current Situation, Course of Action, Management, Documentation)* Domain (multiple is better)* Description* RationalWhere Category is:* Current Situtation (see MSDL scenario definition) & Initial Condition* Course of Action (see MSDL scenario definition) & Sequence of Events* Management [ex. Object Handle]* Metadata & Documentation [ex. ExecutiveSummary]12Perhaps some metadata elements need to be added to the MSDL XML Schema about the particular military scenario such as, exercise name, OPORD name/number reference, task organization (UTO) index and version (i.e. UTO 2.1), who developed the scenario, when the scenario was developed, etc.  If the complete MSDL is going to be developed over time by different organizations/sources, perhaps some metadata elements are needed to describe who added, modified, deleted particular data elements when. ARL:UT; B. CarltonSpecification13ACSIS currently includes unique enterprise wide identifiers (ORG_EID) for all Army organizations.  The Global Force Management program will include ORG_EIDs as well as EIDs for all equipment types, crews, and dismounted personnel billets.  Perhaps a ORG_EID needs to be included in the MSDL Unit data element.ARL:UT; B.

See Annex D for the agenda. Several topics were discussed and the details are provided in the following sections.Military Scenario Definition Language Overview and DiscussionThe purpose of the overview is to open the roadway to defining the scope of the Military Scenario Definition Language by the community. See presented document, Military_Scenario_Definition_Language.ppt (posted on the SISO WebBoard, 14 June 2005). MSDL – Constraints and PracticesMSDL is constrained in both scope and depth. Scope is presented by the definition of a Military Scenario. Depth is presented by the application independence of the data: Core, Common, and Custom applications of scenario data. MSDL practices are:The XML style that provides for consistent format and unambiguous content.The XML Content & Organization that uses and describes the keys, references and consumer/provider options.The Standards that provide for interoperability between C2 planning systems and the tools which execute those plans (simulations). See the presented document, MSDL Constraints & Practices.ppt, (posted on the SISO WebBoard, 14 June 2005).Proposed MSDL DefinitionsThe Study Group has proposed the following definitions for the terms that are important in defining the scope for MSDL.OwnerTermDefinitionRelationship to MSDLReferenceOOSMilitary Scenario Definition LanguageMSDL is an XML data interchange format used to interchange military scenario across systems and applicationsJeff AbbottOOS Military Scenario  MSDL - Proposed: Scenario is the current situation in terms of METT-TC plus the current course of action.

An identification of the major entities that must be represented by the federation, a conceptual description of the capabilities, behavior, and relationships (interactions) between these major entities over time, and a specification of relevant environmental conditions (e.g., terrain, atmospherics).  Initial and termination conditions are also provided.  The style of format of the scenario documentation (e.g., graphics, tables, text) is entirely at the discretion of the federation developer.  However, communities of use may wish to establish scenario documentation standards among themselves to facilitate reuse of scenario components. [7]  4. A part of the modeling and simulation database that contains the force structure, its mission and plans, and the terrain area in which the simulated engagement occurs.

Report from Fidelity Implementation Study Group.UKCommunications Table  SEQ Table \* ARABIC 2: MSDL Proposed DefinitionsRelevant Projects, Products and Topics to Define MSDLThe purpose of this section of the report is to demonstrate that the study group has taken a broad view of the community and worked to bring others into the MSDL study group process. Below are the major organizations/projects with which we have coordinated.MATREX - Initialization of Distributed SimulationsThe matrix, which was developed as part of the MSDL and MATREX collaboration effort was presented. It describes the elements, attributes and other considerations for extending the MSDL. This matrix was seen as a possible example that the MSDL Study Group could use for good ideas extensions. See example document, MSDL_MX Survey Example.xsl, for matrix contents. Also see presented document, MATREX Sim Init Briefing to MSDL Study Group.ppt (posted on SISO WebBoard, 14 June 2005). The group determined that this matrix proposed by the MATREX team would be the straw man for the method by which others would recomment changes to MSDL. A peer review was opened on 14 June 2005 and completed on 23 June 2005 to comment on this spreadsheet as a method and recommend improvements.AWARS, CAPES/MC2, C3 DriverMC2/CAPES will be funded for upgrade to use MSDL and support the standardization process. MCT interacts run-time with AWARS to maintain COP and receive SA. MSDL support will be in place by the end of FY05. See presented document, AWARS-CAPES-C3D-3.ppt (posted on SISO WebBoard, 14 June 2005).MSDL, BML and BOM CollaborationThe relationship among MSDL, BML and BOM was described. The BOM documents the conceptual object model for use in extending and modifying systems, which implement from the BOM. Suggested that the Extendable Modeling System Framework (XMSF) profile could be used to create a profile of MSDL. BOMs have the advantage over enumerations that they identify, not only the object type, but the events/behaviors that object supports. BOM Ids could be mapped to 2525B symbol Ids to provide a common understanding of objects, behaviors and interactions between planning systems and execution/simulation systems. See presented document, BOM_MSDL_BML_060905.ppt (posted on SISO WebBoard, 14 June 2005).Terrain Reasoning and Geo BMLTerrain impacts ability to:ManeuverCommunicateTarget/ObserverEngageMust be able to relate the plan (phase, task, ect.) to the effects of mission time and space. What is the effect (most likely, most dangerous) of geography on the plan?Applies to the (semi-automatic) development of IPB (OCOKA)Observation and fields of fireCover and ConcealmentObstaclesKey TerrainAvenues of ApproachIntelligence preparation of battlefield is significantly important to placement and selection of control measures. GeoBML would be used to interchange the understanding of how terrain impacts on or is being utilized in support of a plan in context to the relationships between the terrain and the control measures which make up the plan.See presented document, Stein_GeoBML_06_09_05.ppt (posted on SISO WebBoard, 14 June 2005).CAE - Definition, Requirements, OrganizationNeed to identify guidance information to aid in consumption of scenario data. When two models apply which should be used in context to the scenario/situation? Suggestions are considered for implementation to the current MSDL schema.Make scenarios modular to swap out forces, weather, COAs, ect. Subsets of the schema could be produced from a top-level schema that references the initial subsets schema element.Attached equipment, type, identification, and owner.Role information needs to be included.Include behaviors to be supported by entity/unit (Symbol Ids do this today)Support:Mission specific objectives and targetsROE – provides an abstraction of behaviorsStrict time-line, random, or free-play time-line (injected events)Link objective with COA, phase, event, and activityMission specific groups (IFF, administrative organization). In navy for example, a group of ships executes as a consolidated group. Should MSDL support this?Equipment specific behavior (mission specific, loads, marking, etc)Mission participant aggregate & groupOrganization (military command relation)Physical (location relations, physical proximity)Interoperability issues/opportunities for MSDLSim to simSim to planning toolsMan (in the loop) to sim & planning toolsEnvironment issuesInter-application commonalityReference methodsSee presented document CAE_MSDL_Orlando_2005_06_09.ptt (posted on SISO WebBoard 14 June 2005). All of these inputs will be taken into consideration. As we move from SG to PDG, we will begin to peer review these comments. Again, the purpose of settling on common definitions is to bind the discussion and ensures we are all speaking the same language. Settling on these common definitions and a standard process will greatly enhance our ability to execute the PDG process.IMASE Scenario Generation Tool (ISGT)ISGT supports MSDL version 3.1.0 (Block C, build 21). It is able to handle 100k – 150k entities; includes entity level resolution; correct RF, EO and IR signature a part of the scenario. See presented document, ISGT Description 2.ppt (posted on SISO WebBoard 14 June 2005).MSDL and ACSIS Network DataEndeavor by PEO C3T, SIMCI OPT and DMSO to solve current and future C4I and simulation initialization challenges. Initialization does not equal complete scenario generation. The ACSIS database includes the UOB and EOB initialization data that is common to both Army C4I systems and simulations. There is plan for ACSIS to extend MSDL for initialization. See more details in section 5.7.1. See presented document, ACSIS_Overview_MSDL_1JUN05.ppt (posted on SISO WebBoard 14 June 2005).Fort Future: Lessons Learned from Modeling of Scenarios and Courses of ActionSuggestions that MSDL needs to address scenario results such as: Evaluation scheme (task measures), objectives and HIE (High Interest Events), etc. GIS data sets are needed in MSDL.See presented document, FF overview for MSDL-SG.ppt (posted on SISO WebBoard 14 June 2005).Scenario Generation Server (SGS)SGS is capable of extracting scenario data from different C4I and simulation data sources. SGS is a pre-exercise tool and is developed for USAF. Scenario considers blue and red orders of battle, airspace control order, mission tasking, model parametric, environment, and communication protocols. SGS has UOB DIF and extension for air campaigns, it uses neutral data interchange format SGSDIF and gateways from SGSDIF to specific formats for C4I & SIMs.See presented document, SGS-30min-brief-2005Mar.ppt (posted on SISO WebBoard 14 June 2005).Signal Scenario Development Toolkit (SSD TK)The presentation for this topic was submitted, but it was not presented at the meeting. See the document VG-397 FGS—Enhanced_SSGTK_MSDL_Study_Group_Comments.ptt (posted on SISO WebBoard 14 June 2005).Domain AnalysisAreas of Interest Matrix are used to determine the organizations’ consumption from MSDL or/and contribution to MSDL development. Organizations have identified and provided the result of the domain analysis in the spreadsheet shown below.

The remaining subsections highlight coordination activities and specific coordination points necessary for aligning the C-BML and MSDL standards-based activities and products.    FY05 MSDL & C-BML Study Group CollaborationDuring FY05 the primary collaboration activity is to identify the scope and coordination points between C-BML and MSDL and to define the alignment activity and schedule.  The POCs for MSDL and C-BML are Dr. Rob Wittman and Major Kevin Galvin respectively.  As depicted in figure 1, C-BML intends to serve the international command and control, simulation (live, virtual, and constructive), and robotic domains with doctrinal, data representation, and protocol standards to communicate strategic, operational, and tactical orders to superiors, peers, and subordinates.  MSDL intends to serve the international command and control and simulation domains with data representation and file transmittal format standards to define military scenario information that can be populated by MSDL compliant scenario planning tools including C4I devices and read by MSDL compliant live, virtual, and constructive simulations including DIS or HLA-based federations.  To meet these objectives both efforts have started to define the military elements, activities, relationships and interactions of interest.  Both efforts have also initiated data modeling efforts with the C-BML leveraging and extending the Command and Control Integrated Exchange Data Model (C2IEDM) as its logical data model, and the MSDL effort developing an XML-based schema and data model.Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 1: BML & MSDL ScopeBoth C-BML and MSDL are leveraging the 5W concept (Who, What, When, Where, and Why) to support the identification, storage, and description of Military entities including organizational and platform level entities,Activities that can be performed by the entities, andRelationships and interactions between the entities, organizations, their assets, and the activities.Additionally both groups, the MSDL under the project leadership of the OneSAF Objective System (OOS) and Army-BML under a Simulation and C4I Interoperability Overarching Integrated Product Team (SIMCI-OIPT) sponsored effort (currently unfunded), are working together to develop a common tasking grammar specifying the syntax and semantics of assigning of a task to a subordinate (entity or organization) by a superior (entity or organization).Finally, both groups are using a phased approach in their Product Development Group (PDG) related planning efforts.  The groups are coordinating their phased approaches in addition to the rules for structure, content, and format as well as the context (NATO, Land, etc.) for the initial and follow on PDG development efforts. Throughout the remained of FY05 the C-BML and MSDL Study Groups will continue to collaborate on the domain and process definitions; data modeling conventions, rules, and guideline definitions; and the tasking grammar development to ensure consistency, alignment, and the ability to easily share products between the groups.FY06 MSDL & C-BML Product Development Group Collaboration and AlignmentPhase I of the MSDL & C-BML PDG effort is anticipated to begin in FY06.  During this phase both groups move into their initial PDG processes.  The focus of the collaboration shifts from process and rule definition to developing a specific set of standards associated with the structure, content, and format for a defined context of entities, activities, relationship, and interactions.   It is expected that this initial PDG effort will collaborate and align with respect to the following:The 5 Ws concept with potential extensions to support Which and How attribution.The naming conventions and types of units, activities, interactions, and relationships.The initial rules and guidelines for structure, content, and format.The initial context for structure, content, and format (NATO, Land, etc.).Continued collaborative development of the formal tasking grammar.FY07 MSDL & C-BML Product Development Group Collaboration, Alignment, and ExtensionPhase II of the MSDL & C-BML Product Development Group is anticipated to occur in FY06.  During this phase both groups refine and extend their initial PDG processes and products.  The focus of the collaboration shifts to extending the context of entities, activities, relationship, and interactions.   It is expected that this second PDG efforts will collaborate and align with respect to the following:Refinement and extension of the naming conventions for units, activities, interactions, and relationships.Refinement and extension of the standardized rules and guidelines for structure, content, and format.Refinement and extension of the standardized context for structure, content, and format. Initial standard-based definition of the formal tasking grammar.Interim ReportThe third task defined in the TOR is preparing the interim report and delivering it at the Euro 05 SIW. The executive summary of the progress report provides the content for the Interim Report. The report will be presented at the Euro 05 SIW on 29 June 2005. See document, MSDL_Interim_Report_29June05.ppt.Process, Schedule, and Good Idea Submission GuidelinesThe fourth task defined in the TOR is performing analysis to determine steps required to establish product specification. The process was discussed at the meeting and comments are requested from the Study Group members by 23 June 2005. The consensus on this process is expected at the Euro 05 SIW meeting. See presented document, MSDL_Process6-02-05.ppt (posted on SISO WebBoard, 14 June 2005).Straw Man Review ProcessThe Study Group review process and shown in Figure 2 is both iterative and incremental.  It allows for the entire Study Group to review and collaborate on the contents of a particular product in an open forum.  Every effort will be made by the study group chair to use network-based mechanisms to distribute and receive comments on the products under review.  The process steps are described below:The process begins with the Study Group Chairperson proposing a new or pre-existing product. The product can be a process definition, a schedule, a document, the MSDL specification, or some other artifact appropriate for review.The review is then opened and announced along with the review opening and closing dates via the SISO MSDL Study Group reflector.  The product is also distributed via the reflector or posted on the SISO MSDL Study Group website. Study Group members then review and comment on the product in an agreed to format or via the SISO reflector discussion threads.  The Study Group Chair is investigating an open source request tracking tool called Web-RT to capture and disposition comments.  Once the review period has ended the Study Group Chair dispositions, clarifies, and integrates as necessary changes into the product under review.  At the end of this stage the product with modifications is redistributed to the Study Group along with a new final review period including the start and end review period dates.Study Group members perform a final review and provide comments in appropriate format to the Study Group chair via the SISO reflector or other agreed to mechanisms.  The Study Group Chair dispositions, clarifies, and integrates final changes and produces the new product baseline (Baseline x+1).  The process is then repeated using the new baseline as the starting point as part of the normal, deliberate review cycle.Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 2: Product Overview ProcessStraw Man Initial ScheduleSeveral key study group products have been proposed for review and comment by the Study Group Chair.

The study group will submit the results via a Final Report at the Fall 05 SIW. The report will summarize the technical findings; describe the significant achievements. The documents that are produced by the study group activities are evaluated and used to create the draft specifications for PDG.The study group will recommend organizing of the Product Development Group to SISO. Fall 2005 Workshop PlanThe focus of the Study Group at this workshop is to deliver the products that allow the Study Group to conclude its activities and nominate the Product Development Group.Deliverable ProductsThe Study Group will deliver three documents at the Fall 2005 SIW for conclusion of the Study Group status and beginning the nomination of the Product Development Group. The deliverables are:The Comprehensive Final ReportThe SIW paper of the Final Report summary.The recommended products to be developed by the PDG in each phase.Product Development Group NominationA Product Development Group nomination was submitted to SAC 14 February 2005; the nomination will be revised to include the findings of the Study Group.  The product nomination (PN) will be reviewed at the next study group meeting in August 2005. The PN will be submitted at the Fall 05 SIW, accompanied with the Study Group Final Report to SAC. Active MSDL Collaboration EffortsArmy Command and Simulation Initialization System (ACSIS)ACSIS-MSDL collaboration effort has defined two working phases: event planning phase and scenario generation phase using ACSIS generated data. The event-planning phase includes a piloting effort to initialize OOS using ACSIS data. The MSDL files will be created using the same ACSIS initialization data set that was used to initialize the C4I devices; these MSDL files are then used to initialize OOS. The short-term plan for the scenario generation phase is starting with an ACSIS generated MSDL, compliant file that has data consistent with a C4I Data Load. The data is imported into MCT without modification and create SSDL file. The data is also imported and initialize the C4I adapter.Some of the ACSIS requirements have been implemented into the MSDL schema; this version of XML schema is available but not included in the package that was distributed via the reflector. The discussion on ACSIS network data usage was continued in the MSDL Study Group face-to-face meeting in June 2005. BMLThe focus of BML-MSDL is coexisting to support hearty scenario definition (MSDL) and execution time information exchange (BML). The collaboration effort has scoped the BML and MSDL by C4ISR and simulation domain. BML is an unambiguous C2 Information Exchange for real-world operational C2 exchanges that includes scenario-based information. MSDL is unambiguous Military Scenario Definition to be used to initialize the simulations including the C2 tasking information. A common grammar or translation between grammars supports interchange between MSDL & BML tasking language information.In December 2004, BML-MSDL participants agreed to work toward common tasking language grammar. In March 2005, the first set of grammar was developed for the selected tasks from the Army Universal Task List (AUTL); the grammars were implemented in the current MSDL XML schema.IMASE Scenario Generation Tool (ISGT)IMASE Scenario Generation Tool (ISGT) has the requirement to support the rapid generation of Operational Test threat scenarios for system testing of US Army Intelligence and Electronic Warfare (IEW) Systems. ISGT has entered into one of the last phases of development. Its current capabilities include multiple client/server using Microsoft SQL, intelligence data importing using UOBDAT v8.1, scenario data import/export using ISGT XML schema, and scenario data exporting using the MSDL schema. ATEC Headquarters has given the task to examine the integration of ISGT, BML, ACSIS and C3 Driver. Currently ISGT has been able to export scenario data into other M&S systems, such as OneSAF Objective System (OOS) using MSDL v3.1.0 Block C build 21.MATREXMATREX has funded OOS to extend the MSDL schema to support MATREX and CERDEC experiments in defining a consistent military scenario for simulation initialization across an entire set of federates.In March 2005, the MATREX-MSDL participants met in Orlando and developed a phase strategy for the collaboration effort. The phases are identified along with the scope of work for each phase. Phase I of the project is in progress.Phase I: Data IdentificationPhase II: Interface DevelopmentPhase III: Business Rule Development for Populating DataMarine Corp CASTUPThe Marine Corp’s Combined Arms Staff Trainer Upgrade (CASTUP) is currently using MSDL as the mechanism to export military scenario data from their real-world C2 device, C2PC, and import into the OTB and OOS systems. The collaboration effort has been going on for at least a year; the Marine Corp and OOS developers are working closely to integrate the new requirements and modifications of MSDL schema into both projects.OneSAF Objective SystemThe OneSAF Objective System (OOS) has developed the MSDL XML schema that is being used as the starting point of the requirement-harvesting task by the MSDL Study Group. The MSDL XML schema is being evolved to support other collaboration efforts that intend to use OOS.AWARS, CAPES/MC2 and C3 DriverMC2/CAPES will be funded to upgrade and support MSDL standard. This support will be in place by the end of FY05.SIW PapersSeveral abstracts of SIW papers that describe the MSDL collaboration efforts have been submitted to SISO for the Fall 2005 SIW. They are: MATREX – Initialization of Distributed Simulations: A Better Way (Fall 05 SIW Abstract)While great strides have been made in the advancement of distribution simulation, one area that has lagged behind is the development of initialization data for a diverse set of simulations that must interoperate in a meaningful way.  Typically, this process involves multiple organizations developing data to initialize their respective simulations, along with a concurrent or subsequent process to ensure that the simulations have a common understanding of the data that will be shared.  Although this process has been executed successfully, it could be improved greatly.  Difficulties exist with configuration management, as data changes made for any single simulation can have impacts on other simulations in the distributed system.  An even larger challenge is the ability to repeat a distributed simulation execution, as each simulation has one or more associated input files that must be reused.The Modeling Architecture for Technology, Research, and Experimentation (MATREX) is developing a mechanism and software for an improved distributed simulation capability.  The MATREX approach employs a common, standardized, data source for all simulation components.  This approach leverages the Military Scenario Definition Language (MSDL) and the Military Scenario Development Environment (MSDE), as used with the OneSAF Testbed Baseline (OTB) and the Objective OneSAF System (OOS).  In addition, MATREX also employs both commercial software and MATREX-developed software to allow for the consolidation of simulation configuration data, as well as for the instantiation and initialization of many additional simulations.  Ultimately, the goal is to store all initialization data for a distributed simulation execution in a single data file.  As data is accessed from a common source, simulations receive consistent representations of simulated entities, and repeating a simulation execution just requires retention of a single data file.MATREX –  (Fall 05 SIW Abstract)Language (MSDL), has been developed by PEO STRI, and proposed to describe military scenarios in an XML grammar in order to initialize any scenario, independent of simulation environments. The ARMY M&S community is coordinating efforts to formally define the MSDL schema in a modular fashion to accommodate the needs of M&S systems and federates.The Modeling Architecture for Technology, Research, and Experimentation (MATREX) Defense Technology Objective (DTO), managed by RDECOM, is planning to use MSDL to initialize its various federates. This paper will develop an approach for autonomous initialization of the MATREX simulation environment using the MSDL schema.   The MATREX team is working with federate development teams to understand their scenario initialization data requirements. These requirements will then be translated into MSDL extensions that the MSDL development team can include in their development cycle when applicable. Once the language reaches a sufficient level of maturity, all initialization tools will be able to read/write data in the MSDL format to express and initialize scenarios in the MATREX environment. Although an MSDL Study Group has been officially approved by the Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization (SISO), and the MATREX DTO is planning to utilize MSDL, there are still issues to be resolved in ensuring that MSDL will be a practical solution for general simulation initialization.  This paper will also develop an approach for using the Resource Description Framework (RDF), an emerging semantic web technology, to assist in expressing scenarios. The RDF is an evolving information format using universal resource identifiers (URIs) for identifying terminology.   It is envisioned that the components of a scenario can be described by MSDL sub-schemas and identified by URIs. The RDF can provide the format to fully express a scenario from the URIs of the components.Military Scenario Definition Language Study Group Final Report (05F-SIW-017)Military Scenario Definition Language (MSDL) Study Group was formed to find the solution that will allow the sharing of the military scenario among the simulations. The goal of the Study Group was to verify the needs for standards, evaluating existing related standardization effort and cultivate a broad base of support across the simulation community for development of MSDL product. The Study Group proposed the following tasks in the Terms of Reference to achieve its goal: reach out to the community to gather the requirements and inputs for MSDL; collaborate with existing standardization effort, C-BML; perform analysis and prepare a set of recommendations for steps required to define the specifications of the eventual product. This paper reports the status of the tasks and the findings of the Study Group. Annex A		AcknowledgementWe would like to thank everyone who contributed to this effort by all means.
