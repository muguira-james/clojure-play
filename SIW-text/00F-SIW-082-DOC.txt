The intent of the initiative is to reduce the time, resources and risk associated with acquisition, enable the integrated product and process development (IPPD) and improve the quality of the fielded product. In March 2000, responsibility for the SBA Initiative was assigned to the Director, Interoperability.  He, together with the Acquisition Council of the Executive Council for Modeling and Simulation, is defining the near, mid and long term actions to implement SBA and to coordinate those actions both within DoD, with our allies and with industry.  This paper presents not only a background of SBA, but also identifies the actions that have occurred since the Spring 2000 Simulation Interoperability Workshop, and provides an Office of the Secretary of Defense perspective on implementing SBA. The realization of SBA will require advances in M&S technologies and standards.1.	IntroductionOver the past four years, the Defense Acquisition Community (both industry and government) has been working towards a vision called Simulation Based Acquisition (SBA) (see figure 1).  What success have we had?  What evidence is there that we have made a difference?  In this paper, we stand back from the individual efforts, and examine the issue from an enterprise perspective.  When we do so, a reassuring pattern emerges.  We attempt, as best one can in the midst of an event, to report on the transformation that is underway.  We present the evidence that exists that supports the thesis that fundamental changes are occurring in the way the Defense Department undertakes acquisition of its new weapon systems.  In part, this change is due to an increasing reliance on and exploitation of advanced technologies, including simulation, to improve both the development process as well as the products being developed.Figure 1.What is remarkable about the transformation we are witnessing is the manner in which it is occurring.  Rather than the traditional top-down approach, the evidence indicates that much of the progress is happening at the grass roots and mid-to-lower levels.  This paper provides a background on the SBA Concept and the current SBA Initiative.  It presents an overarching view of current events, reviews and comments on the evidence, and assesses the progress being made by government and industry towards the vision.  2.	Background2.1 	Context: Current Revolution in Business AffairsThere are several revolutions underway today within the Department of Defense (DoD).  The Revolution in Military Affairs challenges us to be prepared both to fighting differently and to engage in different kinds of conflicts than we have fought before.  Our focus has shifted to such things as information dominance, rapid force projection, and smart self-contained weapons.  As we modernize our armed forces, this revolution is defining what we must buy.  Likewise, the Revolution in Business Affairs directs that we place management emphasis on core competencies.  There is an emphasis to reduce overhead, leverage computer technology and ensure interoperability among systems.  This revolution is impacting how we buy [Ref 1].2.2	SBA ConceptThe SBA concept would employ a number of new technologies, including the robust use of simulation, to address what we buy and how we buy it.  In particular, some of the most promising technologies are those that will enable advanced modeling and simulation (M&S).  It is believed that these technological advances will usher in an era where the use of M&S tools in acquisition will become pervasive.  It is envisioned that much of acquisition will be done in the virtual environment.  This will permit, for example, the examination of many more alternatives during the acquisition process than has been the case traditionally.  As the design of the product is refined, so are the associated models and simulations.  The process will produce both the product and mature representations of the product.  These latter will support the sustainment, modifications and ultimately disposal of the product over its total life-cycle.  SBA entails deliberate and coordinated use of M&S across the many acquisition domains, over all phases of a program’s life cycle.  It further promotes the reuse of M&S between programs.2.3	The GenesisThe genesis of the SBA movement was at the grassroots level within government.  This was in response to a need to change the existing way DoD does acquisition. That need has been described in papers given at earlier Simulation Interoperability Workshops [Refs 2 and 3]. Faced with the task of acquiring increasingly complex systems, faster and with relatively fewer resources than in the past, individual acquisition programs have been forced to explore new ways to accomplish their mission.  The advances in computer, visualization and communication technologies, among others, have permitted these programs to use M&S to support the designing, building, testing and fielding of very sophisticated products.  The evidence from these experiences suggests that substantial economies can be realized if we can integrate the use of M&S across the various functional areas within a program, across the different phases of a program, and across programs themselves.  Today’s programs recognize that models and simulations will become core resources for the future of acquisition within DoD.  For all those involved in the acquisition of new systems (whether they determine requirements or address how the new weapons will contribute in a system of systems environment), the use of M&S early and throughout the acquisition process will become essential. 2.4	Confirming EvidenceThe confidence the DoD leadership has placed in SBA is based on strong and compelling evidence found in recent acquisition programs.  In the Study on the Effectiveness of Modeling and Simulation in the Weapon System Acquisition Process, instances are cited that illustrate the potential benefits of SBA [Ref. 4].  Examples include how M&S tools have permitted the Navy to reduce the standard parts list from 95,000 for the Seawolf class submarine to about 16,000 for the NSSN.  The Army Tank and Automotive Research Development and Engineering Center was able to design a new, low silhouette tank prototype using 14 engineers for 16 months, whereas it previously took 55 engineers 36 months.  Using Computer Aided Design (CAD) models on the B-2 program permitted the Air Force to achieve first-time correct tube bending of expensive titanium electronic cable conduits.The evidence from programs such as these, combined with examples from industry (e.g., the automotive and aircraft manufacturers) and the research initiatives of DARPA and other agencies (e.g., Simulation Based Design) illustrates the potential contribution of a comprehensive, integrated simulation-based approach to defense acquisition. 2.5	SBA InitiativeThe initiative associated with SBA attempts to identify and implement the actions required to bring about the new approach to systems acquisition, and doing so in the most efficient, expeditious and least disruptive way possible.  OSD is committed to making SBA a reality, and recognizes the need for change in the acquisition process if we are to modernize the force.  In 1998, a joint SBA task force made up of representatives from the Services and several DoD agencies was created to develop a conceptual Road Map of what needed to be done to realize an SBA environment in Defense acquisition.  It was recognized from the start that the acquisition community consists not only of the Defense acquisition workforce, but also includes industry.  An SBA industry steering group worked with the Acquisition Functional Area Council to help identify the elements and principles associated with SBA and exemplified a tenet of SBA – a partnership between government and industry.  The current approach has been to encourage the individual efforts in order to advance the knowledge about the use of M&S in Defense acquisition, and, from an enterprise perspective, to take those steps to expedite and facilitate the best practices.3.	Service ImplementationAll the military Services are responding to this initiative with actions of their own.  And this trend is not limited to DoD alone.  NASA has a similar initiative, as do other government agencies.  Similarly, Industry, in the commercial arena, has also made changes in its processes to incorporate SBA-like ideas.3.1  ArmyThe Army’s initiative for capitalizing on M&S technology to address the issue of system development and life-cycle costs through the combined efforts of the requirements, training and acquisition communities is entitled: Simulation and Modeling for Acquisition, Requirements and Training (SMART).  This acronym was coined by LTG Kern (see the May/June 2000 issue of PM Magazine for additional thoughts by LTG Kern on simulation and acquisition reform).  For the Army SMART is about collaboration (see fig. 2).  Their philosophy has been one of centralized planning and decentralized execution.   To motivate their PMs to incorporate SMART into their programs, they have implemented a multi-pronged approach.  First, the Army has designated several of their programs (i.e., Crusader, Apache, Future Scout Cavalry System and CCTT) as SBA flagship programs.  These programs from different domains, each rely heavily upon M&S.  They have addressed issues associated with the use of M&S and can share these experiences with other Army programs.  Second, the Army has looked for opportunities to leverage the work being done by others.  They have entered into a formal agreement with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to participate in a number of M&S related initiatives (e.g. RDEC HLA Federation, an Army/NASA Virtual Integration Laboratory and an ICT immersive training environment.)  The Army is working in collaboration with DARPA on defining the Future Combat System.  It will be a multi-function, multi-mission re-configurable system of systems to maximize joint inter-operability, strategic transportability and commonality of mission roles.  The first phase is a DARPA/Army collaboration that will be a SMART managed program.   This program has been touted as the Army’s’ SMART “proof-of-concept” program.  In the area of M&S related standards, the Army is working with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  Finally, the Army has promoted awareness of SMART.  Annually, they have hosted a SMART conference.  This is attended by those responsible for system requirements and system training, as well as from the program offices themselves.                  Figure 23.2	Air ForceOn 1 June 2000, the Air Force issued its new instruction AFI 16-1002 that provides policy framework for SBA.  The new instruction was a result of a SBA Tiger Team formed in December 1998 that was led by the Air Force Materiel Command.  The team was comprised of four working groups based on the key component of SBA identified in the SBA Road Map: Collaborative Environment, Distributed Product Description (DPD), DoD/Industry Resource Repository (DIRR), and Digital Interchange Format (DIF).  When the work was presented at a General Officers SBA Conference in January 2000, the need for an SBA Infrastructure Program was identified.  This was incorporated into the instruction, and the Air Force is now developing the plans to implement a funded infrastructure program. The SBA program will be led in program development and management by the Electronic Systems Center at Hanscom AFB. Specifically, the new Instruction is intended (a) to guide the direction of M&S in Air Force acquisition; (b) implement DoD policy for using M&S in the acquisition process; (c) guide Air Force M&S investment strategy; (d) ensure M&S acquisition products are effective, suitable and reliable; and (e) link M&S use in acquisition to requirements generation, testing, logistics and education. 3.3	NavyTo address the technical and cultural challenges that exist in implementing SBA, the Navy has begun work on a Campaign Plan.  The plethora of related initiatives that exists within the Defense Department is a key challenge they are working.  The other initiative include: Integrated Digital Environment (IDE), Joint Computer-Aided Acquisition and Logistics Support (JCALS), Integrated Manufacturing Technology Initiative, University projects (e.g., MIT Center for Innovative Product Development) and Collaborative commercial e-commerce marketplace ventures.  The hope to identify a set of common enablers associated with SBA and these other efforts.  The campaign plan would then focus the Navy’s efforts on implementing these enablers.  To build the business case for investment in SBA, the Navy is focusing on return of investments at two levels: within programs where faster and smarter decisions can be made, at less cost with a better product and more efficient Test and Evaluation; and at the Corporate level to foster a system of systems analysis for a wiser investment and ultimately yield more affordable programs.  Currently, many Navy programs are implementing several aspects of SBA that will yield valuable lessons to the acquisition community.4.	DoD and Other InitiativesAt the Office of the Secretary of Defense level, there has been evidence of progress on several fronts.In the policy arena, the Defense Department is in the process of rewriting the series of directive governing Defense acquisition.   The current coordinating documents of these new directives formally incorporates Simulation Based Acquisition into DoD policy.The Defense Department Foundation Initiative 2010 project is developing and validating the set of core products for the Test and Evaluation Community.  It will enable the interoperability necessary to create synthetic battle-spaces consisting of actual weapon systems at multiple ranges, system components in hardware-in-the-loop facilities, and/or simulations of weapon systems.  Furthermore, through the establishment of a common architecture, reuse and interoperability of range assets will be furthered.  The Foundation Initiative is developing and validating a common architecture [referred to as the Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA)], a core set of tools, inter-range communications capabilities, interfaces to existing range assets, and a repository of reusable software, along with recommended procedures for conducting synthetic exercises.  TENA will be compliant with the DoD HLA for simulations.  It will address those areas of test not supported by HLA and drastically improve the ability of ranges to interact with simulations. In an effort to better understand the actual level of usage of M&S in DoD programs, the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation contracted Hicks and Associates to conduct a survey of what M&S is in use, how it is used, who maintains it, how is it certified, and the extent of program investment in M&S.  The survey found that:Current DoD M&S is not viewed by PM’s as cost or schedule effective;More work needed on M&S development and documentation to support acquisition;Guidance is needed on how to manage M&S efforts;Forward planning and an early investment for M&S needs to be accomplished by program offices where the focus is typically on the short term.Finally, the National Research Council has initiated a study through the Board of Manufacturing and Engineering Design at the request of the Director of the Dewfense Modeling and Simulation Office , to look at Modeling and Simulation Enhancements for the 21st Century Manufacturing and Acquisition.  5	SummaryWe have presented a brief summary of the SBA Concept and the background of events that have taken place over the past five years.  SBA is the future way the Defense Department will do system acquisition.  But in this paper, we have also reviewed a number of current actions that are underway across the Defense Acquisition Community.  These pieces of evidence, taken together, suggest that that future state is not as far in the future as it once was.  Progress is being made and it is occurring through the coordinated, but individual efforts of many. We continue to face challenges.  However, building upon the work that has been done to date, and capitalizing on the opportunities and initiatives of others, we will continue progress towards making the SBA Concept a reality.6.
