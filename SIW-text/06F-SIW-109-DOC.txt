Currently, spacecraft communications is perhaps the most developed commercial space industry.  As U.S. military operations begin to rely on space communications, space communication effects and designs need to be evaluated and assessed for improvements and effectiveness.  Current modeling and simulation techniques do not adequately represent space communications assets so the impact of space communications on full spectrum operations cannot be baselined, assessed, or defensibly recommended for improvement.  To remedy this capability shortfall, the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC) and Communication Electronics Research Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) developed a Space Communications Effects Federation (SCEF).The SCEF provides the capability to demonstrate the U.S. Army Concept for Space Operations in the field of communications.  The SCEF integrates space communications effects with operational scenarios to evaluate the benefits associated with space-based assets.  The SCEF provides measures of effectiveness and suitability to various net-centric tactical communications solutions being explored by current transformational programs. Using the emerging Army OneSAF Objective System (OOS) next generation Computer Generated Force-, the CERDEC developed COMPOSER Communications Effects Simulator (CES) and the SMDC Space Server for satellite locations, the initial activities of the SCEF will evaluate space communications capabilities to include:The use of satellite relays to reduce the number of terrestrial communications relays; The use of a satellite “switch in the sky” backbone network to reduce node centers; Increasing the Commander’s span of control for battlespace engagement; Projecting the Global Information Grid to the forward line of troops; Space communications impact on network survivability with respect to various threats such as attack, sabotage, and electronic warfare; and enabling battle command on the move.  Space Communications provides the ability to communicate anywhere, anytime and can often be the only communication method in remote and developing countries.  The SCEF links satellite simulation tools with the latest communications representation to provide the ability to collect information and plan military activities and missions.IntroductionCommunications is the “backbone” for current and future forces on the battlefield.  Space is increasingly playing a large role in communications and will do so even more in the future.  The U.S. Army Concept for Space Operations develops solutions to enable the capabilities for the warfighter to:Support increased deployability and reduced theater footprintAchieve situational understanding “Off the Ramp” during entry operationsSupport precision maneuver, fires, sustainment, and informationEnable continuous information and decision superiorityProtect the force during all phases of the operationSpace Operations issues historically center around problems with reliability and timeliness of the service, significant operational friction, and excessive technical and procedural seams.  Current modeling and simulation tools do not adequately represent space communications assets or space communications impacts on full spectrum operations. To address the lack of modeling and simulation capability to evaluate the effect of space on communications, the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC) developed the Space Communications Effects Federation (SCEF).  The SCEF links satellite simulation tools with the latest communications representation to provide a demonstration of connectivity and bandwidth of space based communications systems.  The SCEF integrates space communications effects into a distributed simulation environment.  It enables the evaluation of the role space has in achieving reliable theater and global communications for the warfighter.  One use of the SCEF is to evaluate the benefits of Leveraging Space Communications Assets to include the following:The use of satellite relays to reduce the number of terrestrial communications relays (Force Protection)The use of a satellite “switch in the sky” backbone network to reduce node centersIncreasing the Commander’s span of control for battlespace engagementProjecting the Global Information Grid to the forward line of troopsNetwork survivability to various threats such as attack, sabotage, and electronic warfareEnabling battle command on the moveObjectiveOperations Research and Systems Analysts (ORSAs) can use the SCEF to analyze the space communications effects on network centric operations.  The realistic representation of space effects on battle command systems is critical in evaluating the importance of space-based assets and any necessary improvements to those systems.To date, the SCEF has evaluated three areas.  The first scenario evaluates the benefit of space for Line of Sight (LOS).  It uses a Field Artillery Call for Fire Scenario involving a Forward Observer without Line-of-Sight to the Supported Maneuver Unit and Supporting Field Artillery Unit.  This scenario highlights how space can provide information when line of sight on the battlefield is not available. The SCEF considers LOS, link budget analysis and bandwidth limitations in determining the best route for a message to get from sender to receiver. The next scenario illustrates network survivability evaluating Terrestrial Network Attack, Electronic Warfare—subject to available threat representations, “Automatic” Fallback to Space, Requires “orders” on the net (probably via a human interactor)The third vignette looks at space for span of control illustrating the value of space based communications for controlling forces.SCEF ComponentsThe SCEF integrates SMDC’s Space Server, CERDEC’s Communications Planner for Operational and Simulation Effects with Realism’s (COMPOSER) Communications Effects Simulator (CES) Suite, and Objective OneSAF System (OOS) in a High Level Architecture (HLA) environment.  Figure 1. shows the SCEF architecture SHAPE  \* MERGEFORMAT 3.1 Space Server.  The SMDC Space Server provides a common representation of space-based assets.  It consists of a modular simulation architecture that supports the integration of multiple simulation components.  This generic interface allows integration of a large number of space simulations and models to meet the operational objectives of the user.The Space Server is used in the SCEF to model the satellite constellation. An external satellite propagation model provides the orbital characteristics of the satellite constellations to the Space Server.  The Space Server then utilizes this data to generate dynamic satellite state updates for use by the CES Suite.The Space Server provides satellite constellation representations at the entity level.  Specific attribute information provided for each satellite instance includes: Satellite ID Position, Velocity, & Acceleration Line-of-Sight Platform Power Status RF Degradation AttributeThe satellite state information is provided to the federation at a periodic rate.  The Platform Power Status indicates the current power status of the satellite platform.  The RF Degradation Attribute represents RF attenuation (dB/km), and is used to approximate related phenomena (e.g. space weather) that impacts signal strength.  The Line-of-Sight attribute indicates whether the satellite instance is within LOS of a pre-defined geographical Area-of-Interest (AOI).  This satellite state information is utilized by the CES Suite to continuously model space-based link performance.3.2 Communication Effects Simulator (CES) Suite.The CES Suite consists of a Communication Effects Simulator (CES), a Network Visualizer (NV), and an HLA interface.  It leverages the Communications Planner for Operational and Simulation Effects with Realism (COMPOSER) CES and COMPOSER NV.  The CES Suite is capable of simulating and visualizing communications effects due to changes to system performance, maneuver and environmental conditions.  The CES Suite models communications effects by taking into consideration:Specifics of the selected military radio waveforms.Environmental factors (such as terrain).Radio transmission effects (such as transmit power levels, relative positions of transmitters and receivers, configured channel or frequency of operation, delays due to RF propagation, and sources of interference).Network effects (such as message latency and message completion rates).The CES Suite provides representations of the communication payloads that reside on each satellite by synchronizing the transceiver to the entity state information provided by the Space Server (essentially marrying the payload to the platform).  When a message is sent through the space-based link, the communications effects space module (located in the CES Suite) will determine if the message reaches its destination.  If it does, the message will be passed onto the next network link.  If not, the message will be lost.  A log of the messages that are passed on and those lost (on a link by link basis) will be used to verify that the model has the desired results.  This is also used to show the importance of considering space effects when analyzing communications networks.  3.3 OneSAF Objective System (OOS).  The OneSAF Objective System (OOS) is the scenario driver for the SCEF.  The OOS simulates individual battlefield components such as soldiers, tanks, and helicopters through aggregate or entity based units, up to the brigade level, operating in either a completely automated mode or under the control of the training audience via their organic command and control systems or role players.  Various tactical scenarios are created within OOS to be used to demonstrate the effects of space-based communications nodes on the battlefield.  In addition to unit and entity attributes, the following information is provided as inputs to the CES Suite from OOS:  terrain characteristics, communication equipment frequencies or channels used, transmitter and receiver characteristics of the devices communicating with the satellites such as position, power settings and antenna attitude as well as the transmitter characteristics of potential interferers.3.4 High Level Architecture (HLA) Implementation. The SCEF utilizes an HLA network architecture to federate the models mentioned.  A runtime infrastructure (RTI) from Virtual Technology Corporation was chosen for the HLA federation.  The current SCEF Federation Object Model (FOM) consists of only those federates in the SCEF (i.e. OOS, COMPOSER CES and Space Server).VignettesVignettes with current, future, and objective force communications systems provide the data for a comparative analysis of the warfighter’s communications capability and its impact on full spectrum operations.  Three Vignettes have currently been completed focusing on Line of Sight, Network Survivability, and Space for span of control.Line of Sight VignetteIn July 2006, a line of sight vignette was developed and exercised to illustrate the importance space provides in terrain obstruction situations.  The functionality of the space communications effects simulation was evaluated by measuring the number of tactical messages created by OOS units that utilize the space-based relay.4.1.1 Line of Sight Overview.  This vignette illustrates the use of space when two friendly units are unable to communicate via terrestrial or airborne assets due to terrain and distance.  Space Server provides a single satellite platform to the federation.  COMPOSER CES attaches a communications transceiver model to the space server platform creating a space based communications relay model.  The satellite relay allows the units to communicate effectively.  Integration of this effort includes successful communication between all federates, OOS units utilizing the COMPOSER CES for their tactical communications networks, COMPOSER utilizing the Space Server satellite object for implementing a space-based relay and OOS units utilizing the space communications relay to communicate tactical messages to additional units outside the range of terrestrial and airborne communications relays.4.1.2 Line of Sight Scenario.  The vignette focuses on a friendly (blue force) infantry battalion maneuvering to occupy a position at the end of a mountain range.  The battalion maneuver is supported by two forward observer platoons and two field artillery platoons.  Two enemy (red force) infantry battalions screen the opposite side of the mountain range with orders to engage the blue force battalion.  The friendly forward observer platoons are emplaced a safe distance from the threat forces on the red side of the range.  The forward observers detect the red forces as unknown units and track them to obtain positive identification.  The platoon leader transmits a situation report to the blue force battalion commander located on the opposite side of the range via the space-based communications relay stating that unknown targets have been detected.  The battalion commander receives this message and relays this information to the artillery platoon leader which in turn is disseminated to both artillery units (Figure 3).Once the forward observers positively identify the units as red forces, the platoon leader transmits the updated track and identification to the battalion commander.  Upon verification that the targets are red forces the battalion commander halts the battalion’s movement towards the end of the range and transmit a call for fire to the artillery platoon leader.  The artillery platoon leader then transmits an order to the artillery platoon leader to fire on the red targets over the range.  The artillery platoon leader sends a message via the space-based relay to the forward observers indicating the incoming fire from the platoon.After the targets have been engaged, the forward observers send battle damage assessment (BDA) reports to the artillery platoon via the battalion commander.  When the battalion commander receives a BDA report indicating that the enemy forces have been neutralized the battalion commander will give the order for the battalion’s artillery units to cease fire and for the infantry units to continue on mission towards the end of the range.Figure 3. Scenario SHAPE  \* MERGEFORMAT 4.1.3 Line of Sight Conclusions.  The Line of Sight vignette evaluated several factors:Detection of enemy units by forward observersIdentification of enemy unitsHalting of advancement of blue forcesArtillery fire on red unitsBDA reports sent and received properlyRemobilization of friendly forces once enemy forces have been neutralizedCES generates a data log capturing the messages relayed by the space-based communications relayNumber of Messages PassedNumber of Messages FailedScenario Mission ReportsNetwork Level Performance StatisticsInternal Federate Data LoggingConfigurable Metric Capture and DisplayMessage DelayRed LossesBlue LossesLoss Exchange RationThe simulation log files were then analyzed to compare these factors.  Based on the data, when the scenario was performed with space, more messages were received and there was a reduction in blue losses.  This illustrates the value of space based communications in a terrain challenged environment.Network Survivability VignetteIn July 2006, a network survivability scenario was also developed to illustrate the importance space provides in mitigating the impact of electromagnetic environmental effects and electronic warfare on terrestrial networks.The functionality of the space communications effects simulation is being evaluated by measuring the message completion rate, in an electronic warfare environment, of tactical messages created by OOS units that utilize a two tier, space and terrestrial, network versus a traditional single tier terrestrial network.4.2.1 Network Survivability Overview.This vignette illustrates the use of space to reinforce a terrestrial network against electromagnetic environmental effects and electronic warfare.  Building upon the line of sight vignette, the network survivability vignette will utilize the same federate relationships with two modifications:  data link instead of voice messages is used and a message routing capability is added.  The network routes traffic based upon the health and status of the communications assets and their ability to provide a high quality of service.  The terrestrial links provide a lower latency service at a higher bit error rate while the satellite links provide a lower bit error rate with a higher latency.  The terrestrial network then experiences an attack via electromagnetic interference that increases the bit error rate of a terrestrial link until the link is completely degraded.  The interference then abruptly stops with the elimination of the EW threat.  Evaluation is based upon the message completion rate that should improve with the use of space communications as an alternative route.4.2.2 Network Survivability Scenario.The vignette focuses on a division with four brigades’ combat teams, an aviation brigade, and a division support brigade, operating in a port city assembly area.  The four brigade combat teams are located in four city sectors, the aviation brigade has occupied the international airport, and the division support brigade is occupying the port and supporting a number of main supply routes.  The division is supporting tactical operations centers at the airport and the port.  The network for this vignette consists of the division and brigade tactical operations centers.  The network load consists of VoIP telephony, video teleconferencing, and data traffic.  The terrestrial network consists of 10km and 30km line of site transmission links.  The satellite network consists of 2.4m EHF ground terminals.The terrestrial network experiences an attack via electromagnetic interference against one then two critical data links that increases the bit error rate of a terrestrial link until the link is completely degraded.  The interference then abruptly stops with the elimination of the EW threat.  Evaluation is based upon the message completion rate that should improve with the use of space communications as an alternative route.4.2.3 Network Survivability Conclusions.The Network Survivability vignette evaluated several factors:Detection of a change in network quality of serviceIdentification of alternative communications pathsRe-routing of network trafficCES generates a data log capturing the messages relayed by the space-based communications relayNumber of Messages PassedNumber of Messages FailedNetwork Level Performance StatisticsInternal Federate Data LoggingConfigurable Metric Capture and DisplayMessage DelayThe simulation log files were then analyzed to compare these factors.  Based on the data, the scenario showed that with space, more messages were received.  This illustrates the value of space based communications during an electronic warfare attack.4.3 Span of Control VignetteIn Aug 2006, a Space for span of control vignette was conducted that shows a brigade combat team leaving an assembly area and conducting an offensive operation 100km north of the division assembly area.The functionality of the space communications effects simulation are evaluated by measuring the resources (equipment and time) required to maintain the span of control from brigade down to company/battery level when comparing a two tier, space and terrestrial, network versus a traditional single tier terrestrial network.4.3.1 Space Enhanced Span of Control Overview.Convoy operations are dangerous with troops and equipment often outside a maneuver control station’s communications range.  Space communications provides convoy commanders and maneuver control stations an ability to react quickly to enemy and environmental threats.  This vignette exercises a number of doctrinal steps in OneSAF to include convoy operations, react to an ambush, call for fire, and medevac requests.  CES impacts each action by bounding the execution to the capabilities of the communication systems.  The Space Server enables the space run with accurate space communications representations.4.3.2 Space Enhanced Span of Control ScenarioSixteen vehicles depart from the port assembly area and travel along a 100km main supply route to a tactical assembly area.  Midway, the convoy is ambushed.  The ambush initiates with an IED destroying the lead vehicle and RPGs disabling the trail vehicle.  The convoy element sends a situation report and a call for fire.  The convoy quick reaction force then secures the area and submits another situation report and a medavac request.4.3.3 Space Enhanced Span of Control ConclusionsThe Space Enhanced Span of Control vignette was evaluated by several performance measures of the following factors:Troop AttritionBattlefield DamageMessage CompletionTotal Number of Messages PassedTotal Number of Messages FailedCES generates a data log capturing the messages relayed by the space-based communications relayNetwork Level Performance StatisticsInternal Federate Data LoggingConfigurable Metric Capture and DisplayMessage DelayThe simulation log files were then analyzed to compare these factors.  Based on the data, the scenario showed that with space, messages traffic was augmented, allowing more control over the forces.  This illustrates the value of space based communications for controlling forces.ConclusionsSummaryThese initial vignettes demonstrate the value of space on operations.  The vignette demonstrates space’s strength and highlights the need for additional space support.  Additional vignettes will be developed to further emphasis how space effects operations.Future WorkThe SCEF vignettes currently scheduled to be demonstrated over the Training and Doctrine Command’s (TRADOC) Battle Lab Collaborative Simulation Environment (BLCSE) in September 2006 to illustrate the value of Space Communications and demonstrate a simulation technique for incorporate space effects into distributed wargames with the potential for incorporation into TRADOC’s future experiments.  This could allow for the validation of tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) for the effect space based communications and improve the historical representation of communications modeled as either perfect or line of sight based and broadens the Terrestrial and airborne communications networks which were the primary focus of studies and analysis.  Now, with the addition of the SCEF to the U.S. Army’s arsenal of models and simulations military planners and analysts have a suite of tools to model the effects terrestrial and space based communications have on the battlefield and, ultimately, the soldier.There is also potential for the SCEF to be incorporated into the BLCSE federation replacing the current communications model ALCES.  This would provide TRADOC with a high-fidelity communications model for its simulated forces.  TRADOC would also gain a greater understanding of coordination amongst units during battle via CES data logs highlighting communications nodes that are both saturated and under utilized.  Discovering communications gaps is crucial in developing an effective and efficient military unit.  This effort would also allow for the effect space-based communication has on the BCT and higher echelons.6.
