Roszyk)Within the C4ISR community there is a continuous need to be able to analyze the impact of intelligence community-derived information upon the battle in terms of quality, quantity and timeliness of related products.  This section of the report discusses efforts to develop elements of a standardized tool suite to support such analyses. Although such analyses are not concerned with connectivity of simulations to real-world C4ISR systems, it is hoped that the discussion of the elements of an ISR FOM to support such analyses can surface issues that will be important to consider when developing a standardized C4ISR-to-simulation FOM.This section first provides some background discussion on the various forms of information which together constitute our intelligence community, as well as provides a discussion of the intelligence "cycle" through which this information is collected and processed before being disseminated to end-users such as the Warfighter.  It then discusses the initial FOM development activity to support the evolution of an ISR Analysis Federation.5.4.1  The Intelligence CycleThe body of information referred to as intelligence is commonly decomposed into  multiple intelligence disciplines, commonly referred to as ‘INTs.’   The most common intelligence disciplines are:IMINT - Imagery IntelligenceSIGINT - Signals Intelligence (consisting primarily of Communications Intelligence (COMINT) and Electronics Intelligence (ELINT) products)MASINT - Measures and Signatures IntelligenceHUMINT - Human IntelligenceOSINT - Open Source IntelligenceAlthough one may think of each of these INTs in terms of their resulting products, each INT discipline consists, among other things, of its own unique set of processes, procedures, organizations, systems and chains of command that result in the respective end product. This overall cycle, nominally depicted in Figure 1, is referred to as the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) cycle. (The overall process, where the commander’s Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4) systems are linked to the ISR cycle is referred to as the C4ISR process.)At a very aggregate level, one can think of each of these INTs in terms of the time delay associated with the request for information and the receipt of a product. Considering the Warfighter as the primary ‘end-user’ of the ISR Cycle’s products, his input is a ‘requirement’ for intelligence products, and the output he receives is the actual product.  His main concern is the performance  measured as quantity, quality and timeliness with which he receives the products he needs.Given this Warfighter perspective, many analytic approaches which have attempted to assess the impact of intelligence upon the battle have traditionally provided little insight into the details across the ISR cycle.  Rather, they focused on individual steps of the cycle, primarily collection.  That is to say, the typical intelligence community studies have developed measures of the quantity of intelligence  products collected over time, with little attention paid to how much of this volume actually makes it through the rest of the ISR cycle and out to the Warfighter.To perform such studies today, there currently are various stand-alone models of different steps of the ISR cycle for multiple INTs that can be ‘sneaker-netted’ together.  However, this approach typically lacks the more detailed representation of the processes across the ISR cycle and also lacks an integration, or fusion, of the different INTs.   An ISR Analysis FOM is an initial attempt to capture the information requirements of a federation to measure performance requirements.  This information is provided to document related 'reference' FOMs, and provide insight to analytic federation data requirements.5.4.2  Project DescriptionAt Booz-Allen & Hamilton a federation development is underway with an initial focus upon the development of an analysis capability for the Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) ISR cycle.  Current efforts are focused on the federation of a collection simulation with a representation of the processing, exploitation and dissemination systems.Later efforts will expand on this initial effort in two dimensions - by developing analysis federations of additional intelligence disciplines, as well as by iteratively integrating the evolving intelligence federation with appropriate C2 and combat models.5.4.3  Federate DescriptionWithin the IMINT ISR cycle there is a series of sequential activities that occur repeatedly.  Data required to share and represent these steps is captured  within the FOM detailed in tables below.  The first step, Requirement/Concept of Operations (CONOPS) Analysis and Generation (RCAG), requires the ability to create and/or visualize the information collection requirements.  Within this process, it is necessary to be able to ‘view’ the IMINT cycle in its entirety.  The particular user requirements, which initiate the process, must be considered in light of the various end-users that will receive the products. Accordingly, this RCAG Federate will enable optimal strategies to be developed for selecting which sensor should collect the information; similarly, strategies will also be able to be developed to optimize the path the product takes through the TPED process.  This portion of the Federation will additionally display data generated by other Federates such as sensor track and way point data, as well as unit ground truth information.  It is through this Federate that the intelligence analyst will primarily interact.The next Federate, Mission Planning, will provide for the planning of ISR collection assets.  This planning includes the definition of satellite orbits and the specification of aircraft tracks, to include data such as way points and orbit duration.  Mission planning will provide scheduling data to the ISR Sensor Collection Federate.The ISR Sensor Collection Federate will provide detailed sensor modeling specifics.  Given time and location data provided by the mission planner, the collection simulation will take into account target priorities, geographic and environmental constraints to determine collection opportunities.  In addition to providing sensor characterizations, the collection simulation will optimize sensor allocations against potential re-tasking and sensor priorities against specific collection requirements.The next Federate, the TPED Federate, will provide a representation and detailed insight into the bottleneck and utilization problems within this ‘system of systems.’  Tasking focuses on the time and systems required to assign requirements to ISR assets.  Processing represents the time and systems associated with translating raw collected data into human and/or machine-readable format.  Exploitation represents the extraction of information and possible creation of intelligence products from collected data.  Dissemination represents the distribution of exploited and unexploited information over communication networks.  Policy, security, physical connectivity and/or military doctrine, each of which will be accounted for in this TPED Federate, inextricably interconnect each of these steps.Lastly, to provide realistic and accurate representations of ground forces and target activity, ground truth will likely be provided to the IMINT Analysis Federation from a traditional force-on-force model.  Depending on the fidelity and the analytic requirements, ground truth could also be provided by traditional mission planning and rehearsal tools.Table  STYLEREF 1 \s 0 SEQ Table \* ARABIC \s 1 1 Identification TableTable  STYLEREF 1 \s 0 SEQ Table \* ARABIC \s 1 2 Object Class Structure TableTable  STYLEREF 1 \s 0 SEQ Table \* ARABIC \s 1 3 Attribute TableTable  STYLEREF 1 \s 0 SEQ Table \* ARABIC \s 1 4 Enumerated Datatype TableTable  STYLEREF 1 \s 0 SEQ Table \* ARABIC \s 1 5 Complex Datatype TableReferences[1]	Joint Vision 2010, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Washington DC (Pamphlet).[2]	Central Intelligence Agency, “Factbook on Intelligence”, 15 October 1997.Study Group for C4I-to-Simulation InterfacesDraft Final Report DATE \@ "MM/dd/yy" 03/23/00Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 1 - The ISR Cycle [2]
