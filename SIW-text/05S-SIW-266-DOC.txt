Technical Information Problem/Change Request Description:The Detonation PDU issuance rules are incomplete and the receipt rules are too general.  This has resulted in numerous incompatible implementations that have required software changes, at considerable cost, for specific exercises in order to ensure compatibility.  It has also increased the cost of technical integration for an exercise in the time it takes to discover  incompatibilities and then retesting systems for compliance with the exercise-specific detonation receive rules.  Adding specific minimum requirements will save time and money during integration testing and provide basic detonation interoperability between simulations.  Analysis of Problem/ChangeExercises conducted over the last 8 years, including , Millennium Challenge 02, have led to detonation processing rules that have commonality in many areas.  The rules that continually appear in various federate agreements need to be incorporated into the standard to provide basic guidance and to help ensure basic interoperability. Recommended ActionThe present paragraph 4.5.3.needs to be revised and additional rules added based on the experience with the Detonation PDU over the last 8 years including major joint exercises such as Millennium Challenge 02.

The receiving simulation application shall also use the information to determine damage that may have been received as a result of the detonation.As a minimum, the receiving simulation application damage assessment model shall check the Location in World Coordinates, Location in Entity Coordinates and Detonation Result field values to determine if the detonation affected one or more of its local entities.a)	If the Target Entity ID matches an active, local Entity ID, and the Detonation Result is Entity Impact, neither the  Location in Entity Coordinates or the Location in World Coordinates values shall be used to calculate the effect of the munition on the target. b)	If the Target Entity ID matches an active, local Entity ID, and the Detonation Result is not Entity Impact, a further position check shall be made to ensure that the detonation occurred at, or in proximity to, the specified local target.  	1)	The Location in Entity Coordinates field value shall be used to determine if it is close enough to the target entity to cause damage or destruction. Other factors that are required by federation agreements or based on a simulation applications damage assessment logic, may also be used.  The relative distance in the  Location in Entity Coordinates field value shall not be adjusted based on where the target entity is presently located before calculating whether an entity was damaged or destroyed.. 	2)	The Location in World Coordinates field shall not be used to assess damage to a local entity that is the Target Entity ID in a Detonation PDU.c)	If no target entity is specified, then the Location in World Coordinates field may be compared with local entities at the receiving simulation application that could be affected by the type of munition contained in the detonation.  d)	All damage assessment, including taking into account factors beyond the minimum requirements set forth here, shall be completed within the time specified in the federation agreement. If no time is specified, then the default time of DETONATE_RESULT_DFLT shall be used.  Any PDU’s required to be output as a result of the damage assessment process shall also be output within this time frame. e)	When all damage assessment checks have been performed and damage or destruction has been determined,  appropriate PDUs shall be transmitted for all affected local entities as follows: 1)	If an entity is always retained as an active entity regardless of the damage assessment, any changed entity appearance or other applicable values shall be transmitted in an Entity State or Entity State Update PDU within the time frame specified in d. above.  	a.	The following Appearance fields, as a minimum, shall reflect the results of the damage assessment: Mobility, Fire Power, Damage and Smoke.  Updates, if required, for other PDU’s associated with the entity shall be transmitted within two seconds of completion of damage assessment logic. This includes, but is not limited to, the IFF/ATC/NAVAID and Electromagnetic Emissions PDUs.  	b.	If the entity Damage Status = Destroyed, the IFF/ATC/NAVAID PDU may be output a final time to indicate all modes are off.  Thereafter, this PDU shall no longer be output so long as the Damage Status = Destroyed.	c.	The Electromagnetic Emissions PDU may be output a final time to indicate Power = 0 for any emitters associated with the entity.  Thereafter, this PDU shall no longer be output so long as the Damage Status = Destroyed.  The exception is emissions from devices that would have survived the destruction, such as an emergency location transmitter (ELT), which may be output in the Electromagnetic Emissions PDU as deemed appropriate. 2)	If the local entity is destroyed and not retained as active by the simulation application, the appropriate Entity State or Entity State Update PDU shall be issued within the time frame set forth in d. above with the Appearance - State field set to Deactivated.  Any associated PDUs for the deactivated entity that were previously transmitted shall no longer be output.  This includes, but is not limited to the IFF/ATC/NAVAID and Electromagnetic Emissions PDUs.f)	The nuclear weapons distance check shall be appropriate for the weapon yield.  Nuclear damage assessment for local entities shall be reflected in Entity State or Entity State Update PDUs based on the nuclear damage model being used.  Such damage may be reflected over a period of time.  g)	Secondary affects from a detonation on additional local entities shall be reflected in appropriate PDUs at times determined by the damage assessment model.h)	A simulation application’s damage assessment model may take into account additional factors whether or not these factors are known to other players.	i)	A damage assessment shall be made whenever the Target Entity ID matches a local entity ID regardless of the Detonation Result value unless the value = 1 (other) in which case no damage assessment need be made. For all other Detonation Result values, the minimum Detonation PDU field values that shall be taken into account in addition to the Location in Entity Coordinates and Location in World Coordinates processing specified in a) and b) above are Munition Type and Warhead. 	j)	A receiving simulation application may always assess damage to its local entities regardless of whether the Target Entity ID is zero or another simulation application’s entity based on the Detonation Result and other fields.	k)	Detonation PDUs representing chemical and biological munitions shall include a representation of the dispersion of the agents using appropriate PDUs.  Simulation applications receiving such munition types shall only be required determine if the physical detonation or impact could have damaged or destroyed one or more of its local entities.  Simulation applications that model the effects of chemical, biological and nuclear agents may further process those types of Detonation PDUs. 	l)	If a simulation application aggregates entities internally but transmits them as individual entities, the simulation application upon processing a Detonation PDU that contains a Target Entity ID that matches one of its local entities shall ensure that damage assessment is performed, at least, against that specific entity. If additional damage processing is performed, it shall ensure that it is performed against individual entities and not against the aggregation as a whole. DIS Study Group - Problem/Change Request FormBlock 1.

There has been disagreement over whether a simulation is required to keep track of the last event number used and continue with the next number when the simulation is restarted during an exercise.  There is also disagreement about whether an Event ID number is required to be incremented for the IFF and Emission PDUs.  The present requirement description is vague and leaves too much to interpretation as seen by the various ways it has been implemented.  In addition, it does not take into account the addition of the Transfer Control Request PDU and the requirement for the new owner of a munitions entity to report the same Event ID in the Detonation PDU as was contained in the Fire PDU issued by a different site/application.  The present Event Identifier Record layout is in error as it defines the Simulation Record as having only a 16-bit  Site and Application field whereas the 1998 edition that added the Live Entity Fire and LE Detonation PDUs calls for 8-bit fields.

One is to associate different type PDUs that are related to the same event, such as the Fire and Detonation PDU associated with an entity.  The other is to associate a PDU with an operational event.    For example, an operator taking a switch action in a radar system to invoke an EMCON condition where the radar is shut off to prevent detection and targeting by a HARM missile.  The software then inserts an Event ID number into the next Emissions PDU to reflect that the switch action was taken.  This would be a one-time event occurrence and the subsequent Emissions PDUs would have the Event ID set back to zero again.  Data analysts could look in the DIS PDU record file and ask for all Emissions PDUs from that federate that had a non-zero Event ID to identify special operational actions such as was described above. DIS Study Group Problem/Change Request Form	PCR 002BPara 5.2.18  page 74  (IEEE 1278.1-1995)  Replace the entire paragraph with the following:5.2.18	Event identifier recordEvent identification shall be specified by the Event Identifier (Event ID) record.  Event identification is the association of a PDU with an event for an entity, or the association of two or more PDUs as part of the same event for an entity.  The only mandatory event is the association of the Fire PDU with the Detonation PDU, and the LE Fire PDU with the LE Detonation PDU.  All other events are optional and at the discretion of the simulation application or as required by federation agreements.  When the Event ID is not used, the Event ID Record fields shall be set to NO_VALUE.  A specific event is initiated by the transmission of the first PDU for a specific entity ID containing a new Event ID and ends when the last PDU for the same Entity ID containing the same Event ID is transmitted.  In the case of a single event for an associated PDU, this may consist of only one PDU that contains an Event ID.  An Event ID, in and of itself, does not identify a unique event.  It is the association of an Event ID with a specific Entity ID that creates a unique event. 1)	The Event Identifier record shall consist of a Simulation Address record and a 16-bit unsigned integer specifying the event number.  The Event Identifier record shall have 2 formats. Format A applies to all PDUs except the Live Entity (LE) PDU and is shown in Table 20.1.   Format B applies to the Live Entity PDU and is shown in Table 20.2.  Table 20.1 - Event Identifier Record - Format ASimulation AddressSite ID - 16-bit unsigned integerApplication ID - 16-bit unsigned integerEvent Number16-bit unsigned integerTable 20.2 - Event Identifier Record - Format BSimulation AddressSite ID - 8-bit unsigned integerApplication ID - 8-bit unsigned integerEvent Number16-bit unsigned integer2)	The Event number shall be uniquely assigned within the host by the simulation application that initiates an event.   The first event number shall initially be set to one or may be set to some other arbitrary number each time a simulation application is started,  restarted, or reinitialized for an exercise.  It shall be incremented by one for each new event that is produced.  	a.	Event numbers may be obtained from a single master source within the simulation application or a separate source for each set of PDUs associated with an event so long as a PDU is not part of more than one set. (An example of a set is the Fire and Detonation PDUs.)  In the case where all possible values are exhausted, the numbers shall be reused beginning at one or some other number so long as it does not a duplicate an existing event number that is currently being used and contained in PDUs being transmitted by that simulation application.    	b.	A sufficient range of numbers should be allocated to minimize the reuse of an event number during an exercise.  An event number of zero may be valid depending on the circumstances.  An Event ID is not required to be used for the case where the simulation application does not require an event to be associated with the PDU (e.g., the initial and subsequent outputs of the  IFF/ATC/NAVAID PDU.)3)	If a munitions entity is created by a simulation application other than the simulation application that issued the Fire PDU, the simulation application for the munitions entity shall ensure that the same Event ID contained in the Fire PDU is also contained in the Detonation PDU.  4)	If a munitions entity is transferred after initiation to another simulation application, the simulation application that assumes ownership shall ensure that the same Event ID from the Fire PDU is contained in the Detonation PDU. (In this case, the simulation address portion of the Event ID will reflect the original simulation application and not the originator of the Detonation PDU.)  See 4.5.83 Entity Handover for how this is accomplished.4)	Table 20.3 lists all the PDU that have an Event Identifier record.Table 20.3 - PDUs with the Event ID FieldPDUStandardRelated PDUsCollision PDU1995Collision PDU from another sourceFire PDU1995Detonation PDU from same sourceDetonation PDU1995Fire PDU from same sourceLE Fire PDU1998LE Detonation PDULE Detonation PDU1998LE Fire PDUEmissions PDU1995NoneCollision Elastic PDU   1998Collision Elastic PDU from another sourceIFF/ATC/NAVAIDS PDU  1998NoneUnderwater Acoustics (UA) PDU  1998Related Events5.1.4	Symbolic namesAdd the following name.	Symbolic Name	Numeric value	NO_VALUE	0DIS Study Group - Problem/Change Request FormBlock 1.

Technical Information Problem/Change Request Description:Paragraph 5.2.14.2 states that Entity ID’s may be reused “when all possible numbers have been exhausted.”  Some have interpreted this to mean that a simulation must cycle through all possible Entity Identifiers in the range 1-65533 ( 0, 65534 and 655 35 are reserved for special uses) even if the simulation has only one entity which may be reactivated/reinitialized often during an exercise.  Many simulations have implemented sequence numbering up to the maximum number of entities they can generate simultaneously and then reuse previous numbers where the entity has been deactivated.  There are many aspects to this problem that need to be researched and analyzed.  Analysis of Problem/ChangeSimulations should not have an issue with the immediate reuse of entity identifiers.

Include Block number.Replace the present paragraph5.2.14.2 Entity IdentificationEach entity in a given DIS simulation application shall be given an entity identifier number unique to allother entities in that application. This identifier number is valid for the duration of the exercise; however,entity identifier numbers may be reused when all possible numbers have been exhausted. No entity shall have an entity identifier number of NO_ENTITY, ALL_ENTITIES, or RQST_ASSIGN_ID. The entity identifier number need not be registered or retained for future exercises. The entity identifier number shall be specified by a 16-bit unsigned integer.With the followingEach new local entity created by a simulation application that is not the result of becoming the owner of an entity originally created by another simulation application, shall be given a unique entity identifier that does not duplicate an existing entity identifier currently active in an exercise.  This entity identifier shall remain assigned to the entity as long as it remains active in the exercise.  An entity identifier consist of a simulation address (site, application) and an entity number.When the entity associated with an entity identifier is deactivated and the last  Entity State PDU or Entity State Update PDU has been transmitted to indicate deactivation, the simulation application may reuse the entity identifier immediately if it is known that no entity is presently active in the exercise with the same Entity identifier.  It may also increment the entity identifier number until all possible numbers have been exhausted.  In cases where a simulation application can generate many entities, it is recommended that they cycle through all possible entity numbers before reusing a number in order to support data collection and analysis activities. There is no requirement that entity numbers be assigned sequentially.    When a simulation applications receives an Entity State PDU or Entity State Update PDU with the Appearance State field set to deactivated, it shall immediately remove the entity from its data base or otherwise set it to deactivated.  The subsequent receipt of an active remote entity having the same entity identifier as a previously deactivated or removed one shall be considered a new entity not related to the previous one and shall be processed accordingly.  PCR 007AThe range of valid entity numbers available to define an individual entity is 1 to 65533.  The mechanism by which entity numbers are assigned is beyond the scope of this standard except that a federate shall ensure that a duplicate Entity Identifier number is not assigned.  Each federate shall ensure that they can process a site, application and Entity number in the range 0 to 65535.  The special entity number values are defined as follows:	a)	Value 0.   This value indicates that the identification record is a federate ID which does not use the Entity  field.  This value is referred to as the NO_ENTITY parameter (See 5.1.4).  	b)	Value 65534.  This value may be present in the Create Entity PDU to indicate to the addressed federate that it must assign the Entity Identifier for the new entity that it has been requested to create.  This value is referred to as the RQST_ASSIGN_ID parameter (See 5.1.4).  	c)	Value 65535.  This value shall mean all entities at a federate.  It may be used in the Receiving Federate ID field of various simulation management PDUs.   This value is referred to as the ALL_ENTITIES parameter (See 5.1.4).  No entity shall have an entity identifier number of NO_ENTITY, ALL_ENTITIES, or RQST_ASSIGN_ID. The entity identifier number need not be registered or retained for future exercises. The entity identifier number shall be specified by a 16-bit unsigned integer.Change “Entity Identifier”  to “Entity” in Table 16 Entity Identifier Record to be consistent with the use of the term elsewhere.PAGE  PAGE  1PAGE  PAGE  8PAGE  PAGE  15
