BML is particularly relevant in a network centric environment for enabling mutual understanding. A Coalition BML, as envisioned by this study group in this proposal, developed and applied by the all Services and by coalition members would not only allow interoperability among their C4ISR systems and simulations, but also among themselves. As it is almost impossible to imagine a situation in the future when a single U. S. Service will be unilaterally employed, these efforts must be embedded into international standards. Because future military operations, and a significant amount of training, will be Joint in nature, it is critical that a Joint Service approach be taken to the BML development effort. The same issues that have driven the Army to embark on this program also confront the other Services as they develop both their C4ISR and simulation systems. Discrete-Event Systems Specification (DEVS SG)Chair:  Gabriel A.

There is a wide variety of groups working on extensions to the DEVS formalism, with several modeling tools based on these extensions. The goal of the study group will be to find a core of the DEVS formalism that is suitable for standardization of activities at the level of modeling. It will bridge the gap between existing simulation frameworks and modeling activities using a standard notation.  The DEVS SG will study the possibility of developing standards for a computer processable representation of DEVS that supports common understanding, sharing and interoperability of DEVS implementations. Computer processable forms include all forms of simulation and real-time execution as well as various forms of syntactic and semantic analysis. STUDY GROUPS (CONT’D)Generic Methodology for VV&A for the Modeling & Simulation Domain (GM V&V) Study GroupChair:  René JacquartVice Chair:  Vacancy Secretary:  VacancySimulations and synthetic environments are becoming more significant in training, defence planning and acquisition.  Decisions requiring large investments and even affecting human lives are already based on simulation results.  As a consequence, the operational need exists not only to build new, but also to acquire and reuse existing models, simulations, and their components with a certain degree of confidence for the intended use. Unfortunately M&S products tend to get more and more complex, requiring more formal engineering processes, which include formal verification and validation processes.  V&V is the “price” for trustworthy M&S products.To solve this issue the GM-V&V SG’s primary objective will be to provide a path into the creation of an internationally accepted VV&A standard complementing the current VV&A PDG efforts (dedicated to an Overlay of the FEDEP) and in consistency with the VV&A PDG efforts and other existing developments.The final objective is to provide the international community with a methodology that not only embraces a wide variety of M&S products but also may provide a future common basis for the simulation community through the GM-V&V product.The GM V&V Study Group will hold its first meeting Wednesday 05 April (from 10:00 to 12:00), during the “International VV&A activities Session” organized by the VV&A Forum (Salon 1A).High Level Architecture Performance Recommended Practice (HPRP) SG  Chair:  Randy Saunders	JHU APL	rsaunders@ieee.orgVice Chair:  Steve Boswell	BBN Technologies	sboswell@bbn.com	Secretary:  Doug Flournoy	MITRE Corp.	rflourno@mitre.orgThe HLA Performance Recommended Practice (HPRP) Study Group (SG) will conduct an investigation on the best practices for maximizing High Level Architecture (HLA) performance.  The issues associated with performance, and performance optimization, have been discussed in numerous SIW papers without the emergence of a widely shared body of knowledge.  The HPRP SG will examine how these best practices could be collected and made more available to the community.  Among the alternatives are: 1) a SISO balloted Recommended Practice; 2) an interactive web product, probably in the form of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ); 3) an overlay to the FEDEP, analogous to the recently completed V&V overlay.STUDY GROUPS (CONT’D)Military Scenario Definition Language (MSDL) SGChair:  LTC John Surdu	PIO STRI, USARMY		 HYPERLINK "mailto:John.surdu@us.army.mil" John.surdu@us.army.milVice Chair:  Maj Kevin Galvin	MOD (UK)		kgalvin.bas@gtnet.gov.uk	Secretary:  Ken Peplow	SAIC		kpeplow@ideorlando.orgThe Military Scenario Definition Language (MSDL SG) is being developed by OneSAF Objective System program to provide simulations with a mechanism for loading Military Scenarios. As a standard, MSDL is not being developed for simulation alone. The intent is for MSDL to define Military Scenarios that are independent of the application generating or using the scenario. To that end, MSDL is an XML based data interchange format that enables C2 planning applications to exchange the military portions of scenarios with Simulations and other applications.The scope to MSDL is bounded by the situation, defined at one instant in time, combined with the COA about to be taken in context to that situation. The intent is for MSDL to include that information which is either core or common to the situation and course of action of a military scenario.Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe MODE 5/S IFF SG Chair:  Frank Hill	SDS International Inc.			frank.hill@sdslink.comVice Chair:  VacancySecretary:  VacancyThe Mode 5/S IFF Study Group (SG) is established to support the DoD/Joint service/NATO simulation community effort to develop the necessary changes to allow live, virtual and constructive simulations incorporate Mode 5 IFF and Mode S (Select) IFF that is currently in use in Europe. The key protocols to review will be DIS, HLA, existing Live Range IFF protocols and TENA as these are the most widely used ones when exchanging exercise truth data. The HLA review includes a review of the RPR FOM and selected other FOMs and SOMs that include IFF information.STUDY GROUPS (CONT’D)SCORM – Simulation Interface Standards SG  Chair:  VacancyVice Chair:  VacancySecretary:  VacancyOne of the important challenges faced by designers and developers of learning, education and training   technology is how to integrate simulation-based learning experiences with SCORM environments. This problem has many aspects, both pedagogical and technical. A clear first step is to enable SCORM content or Runtime Environments to invoke and communicate with simulations in a standardized and interoperable fashion. Such "SCORM-Simulation Interface Standards" will lower the cost of integration, lead to tools that save designers and developers time and money and help simulation vendors develop reusable simulations and components. This Study Group will be joint between SISO and the IEEE Learning Technology Standards Committee (LTSC).Simulation Conceptual Modeling (SCM) SG Chair:  Jake Borah	AEgis Technologies Group	jborah@aegistg.comVice Chair:  VacancySecretary:  VacancyThe SCM SG is conducting a preliminary investigation on the use of conceptual modeling in M&S and related information technology domains.  The study group will perform exploratory work into the establishment of best practices for simulation conceptual modeling, and establish recommendations for persistent management of the topic within SISO.Transfer of Control (TC) SG Chair:  Frank Hill	SDS International Inc.			frank.hill@sdslink.comVice Chair:  Patrick Merlet	Sparta	Patrick_Merlet@sparta.comSecretary:  VacancyAt the Fall SIW, the Transfer Control SG Meeting presented a tutorial on transfer ownership for DIS and HLA software developers and users based on the new 1278.1 transfer ownership design.  The Transfer Control SG is now turning to supporting implementers and users of transfer ownership using the SISO TC SG Reflector and via phone and email support from TC SG members.  We will also be working on an HLA FOM to cover pure HLA transfer ownership issues in the coming months.STANDING STUDY GROUPS Standing Study Groups are established to represent a specific community or national group to mature a potential standard, or potentially to provide support to open-source software.Common Image Generator Interface (CIGI) SSG Chair:  Ronald G. Moore	SAIC	ronald.g.moore@saic.comVice Chair:  Willard B. Phelps	Boeing	willard.b.phelps@boeing.com Secretary:  Michael Butterworth	Northrop Grumman	michael.butterworth@ngc.com	Information TechnologyThe goal of the Common Image Generator Interface (CIGI) Standing Study Group (SSG) is  to evaluate industry and government interest in developing a standard image generator interface.  Typically, today's Image Generator (IG) vendors have their own closed, proprietary run-time interfaces.  At I/ITSEC'02, Boeing proposed their Open Source Common Image Generator Interface (CIGI) as a run-time interface that could be adopted by the simulation community.  Boeing indicated that they would like to see a standards organization adopt CIGI and develop it into a robust and broadly accepted simulation industry image generator run-time interface standard.  The SG is discussing this proposal, evaluating alternatives, and generating recommendations and a proposed action plan.Distributed Interoperability Simulation (DIS) SSGChair: Frank Hill	SDS International Inc.			frank.hill@sdslink.comVice Chair: Vacancy Secretary:  VacancyThe DIS SSG is a new Standing Study Group (SSG) supporting the DIS community by: acting as a forum for DIS discussions; providing technical support to users and developers by answering questions; providing contact information for experts in different areas and maintaining a library of DIS documentation.  The DIS SSG is also the place where Problem/Change Requests (PCRs) can be initially submitted or commented on for changing the 1278 series of IEEE DIS Standards.  It closely coordinates with the DIS PDG and DIS Enumeration reflectors to ensure that the entire DIS community is kept appraised of DIS developments.  Not all DIS users are members of all 3 groups (DIS PDG, DIS ENUM and the DIS SSG) for whatever reason so cross-coordination is essential.   The DIS SSG along with the DIS PDG have become the two primary places that people come for DIS information.  We have been very responsive to the needs of the DIS community and plan to continue that support.PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT GROUPS Product Development Groups (PDGs) are approved to generate specific SISO Products (Standards, Guides, and Reference Products) after approval of a formal Product Nomination.  Current Product Development Groups include:Base Object Model Specification (BOM) PDGChair:  Larry Root	SimVentions, Inc.	lroot@simventions.comVice Chair:  Bob Lutz	Johns Hopkins Univ/APL	robert.lutz@jhuapl.eduSecretary:  Jane Bachman	NSWCDD TEAMS	Jane.Bachman@navy.milThe BOM PDG has developed a specification and a guidance document for Base Object Models. This open standardization of BOMs has been essential for establishing component technology to facilitate interoperability, reusability and composability. As part of this standardization effort, the PDG has defined an XML schema to identify the base elements and ontology of a BOM and provided guidance describing how BOMs can be used to generate FOMs and SOMs from BOM compositions.  Current efforts include completing the SISO standardization effort – which involves  submission and approval of the balloted documents by the SISO SAC and EXCOM,  transitioning the PDG from a document development effort to a standards awareness and training effort, making available BOM implementation examples like RPR BOMs.Core Manufacturing Simulation Data (CMSD) PDGChair:  Swee Leong	NIST	leong@cme.nist.gov	Vice Chair:  Frank Riddick	NIST	 HYPERLINK "mailto:Riddick@cme.nist.gov" Riddick@cme.nist.govSecretary:  Tina Lee	NIST	leet@cme.nist.govThis product defines a data interface specification for efficient exchange of manufacturing life cycle data in a simulation environment.  The specification provides neutral data interfaces for integrating manufacturing software applications with simulation systems.  The initial effort is focusing on machine shop data definitions.  The plan is to extend the data specification to include supply chain, aerospace assembly operations, automotive vehicle assembly operations, plant layout, and other relevant manufacturing and simulation information.This standard effort is to promote the increased, widespread, and pervasive use of advanced manufacturing technologies, in particular, the simulation technology in the manufacturing industries. The effort will benefit not only the manufacturing industry worldwide, but more specifically it will benefit the Modeling and Simulation community in the near term.PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT GROUPS (CONT’D)Commercial Off-the-Shelf Simulation Package Interoperability (CSPI) PDG   Chair:  Dr. Simon J E Taylor	Brunel University	simon.taylor@brunel.ac.ukVice Chair:  Steffen Strassburger	Daimler Chrysler 	Steffen.strassburger@daimlerchrysler.comSecretary:  Stephen Turner	Technological Univ		 HYPERLINK "mailto:assjturner@ntu.edu.sg" assjturner@ntu.edu.sg		   (Singapore)	Since 1980 efforts to improve the productivity of simulation modeling in manufacturing have yielded the range of COTS discrete event simulation packages (CSPs) that are used today by engineers and analysts to investigate complex, dynamic process-based systems found in commerce, health, manufacturing and supply chains.  It is true that there are many different types of system that might be called COTS packages.  However, this work concerns itself with systems that fall under the discrete event simulation paradigm, i.e. simulated models of systems that change state at discrete points in time (scheduled events) or as a result of state changes (conditional events).  These state changes typically represent entities  (documents, patients, parts, trains, etc.) that pass through networks of queues and workstations (work queuing at a desk in an office, patients waiting to see a doctor, parts buffered for machining, trains waiting at a station, etc.)  CSPs support activities such as model building, experimentation, animation, visualization and reporting.  There are currently around 20 of these commercially available.It is important to note that the model/CSP technology is a fixed point.  Virtually every engineering faculty has some course on simulation modeling that uses one or more CSPs.  Engineers and analysts use these CSPs to build and maintain simulation models.  These CSPs therefore represent a significant investment.  Additionally, users of these CSPs are not software engineers – they are simulation modelers.  There is evidence to show that it is highly likely that any major changes to their methodology and technologies will result in the non-adoption of these proposed products.  It is therefore a major consideration of our work that any interoperability products that are developed are highly transparent in nature.	Distributed Interoperability Simulation (DIS) PDG Chair:  Ralph Weber	CSC	rweber@csc.comCo-Vice Chair:  Frank Hill	SDS International Inc.		frank.hill@sdslink.comSecretary:  Rob Byers	NGC	Robert.byers@ngc.comThe DIS PDG is developing a balloted revision to the IEEE DIS standard 1278.1 and 1278.1a to be designated 1278.1-200X. An incremental approach using a Problem/Change Request (PCR) process along with Tiger teams for specific functional areas are being used to expedite publication of the first revision as there are important changes that need to be made, and balloted on, in the very near term, such as the recommended entity handover changes from the SISO Transfer Control Study Group.  We will review the changes that have already been incorporated as of 31 Aug 05 into Draft 0 of 1278-1-200X at this SIW. This draft with the changes to date will be available to DIS PDG members about two weeks prior to the SIW and will be designated Draft 1.The group will also review IEEE 1278.2, IEEE 1278.3, and IEEE 1278.4 prior to 31 December 2005 and recommend update, reaffirmation, or withdrawal of these standards.PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT GROUPS (CONT’D)Environment Data Coding Specification (EDCS) PDG Chair:  Bob Richbourg	IDA	rricbou@ida.orgVice Chair:  Dale Miller	Lockheed Martin Simulation,	 HYPERLINK "mailto:ddmiller@lads.is.lmco.com" ddmiller@lads.is.lmco.com	  Training & Support (LM STS)Secretary:  VacancyThe EDCS PDG is a component of the Synthetic Environment Data Representation Interchange Specification (SEDRIS) that provides a data dictionary and coding standard for environmental data used in simulations of terrain, atmosphere, ocean, and space.High Level Architecture (HLA) - Evolved PDG Chair:  Roy Scrudder	DMSO	roy.scrudder@dmso.milVice Chair (US):  Randy Saunders	JHU/APL	r.saunders@ieee.orgVice Chair (European):  Bjorn Moller	Pitch	bjorn.moller@pitch.seSecretary:  Katherine L. Morse	SAIC	Katherine.l.morse@saic.com The IEEE 1516 series of HLA specifications was originally approved by the IEEE Standards Activity (SA) Board in Fall 2000. Since that time, a DoD Interpretations Document for IEEE 1516 and a Dynamic Link Compatible HLA API for IEEE 1516.1 have been in active development. In addition, many new potential HLA requirements have been identified based on feedback from the various domains and application areas that comprise the HLA user community. This PDG seeks to address these requirements via a formal open review of the IEEE 1516 series of specifications. As part of this process, the PDG will incorporate those aspects of the Interpretations Document and Dynamic Link Compatible HLA API that need to become part of the core standard.Link 11 A/B Simulation Standard Network (Link 11 A/B) PDG   Chair:  Joe Sorroche			DMOC/ASRCC	 HYPERLINK "mailto:joe.sorroche@kirtland.af.mil" joe.sorroche@kirtland.af.milVice Chair:  Joe Zehnle			The Boeing Company	Joseph.j.zehnle@boeing.comSecretary:  Rob Byers			Northrop Grumman	Robert.byers@ngc.comThis product will be a SISO standard to define the methods to simulate a Link-11 A/B Network within a Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) or High Level Architecture (HLA) framework.This standard will have two parts, one that will describe extensions to the DIS standard and the second will detail a Base Object Model (BOM) to extend Federate Object Models (FOM) operating in the HLA framework. The standard shall detail implementation and usage methodologies in DIS and HLA as well as defining the data structures.

Experiences using SRML have been highlighted in several SIW papers as described in the SRML Study Group Final Report. SRML has already gone through an examination process by the World Wide Web Consortium for submission as a Note and has been accepted.The first step is to assemble the SRML product development team, to include members recognized as simulation engine developers and simulation data modelers. Next the team will develop a language specification that will include a description of the SRML concept and XML tag set for the language. Additionally, an SRML user guide will be developed. An engine specification will be developed to include a detailed description of the simulation engine object model and engine API reference.PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT GROUPS (CONT’D)Verification, Validation & Accreditation Overlay to Federation Development (VV&A) PDGChair:  Simone Youngblood	DMSO	syoungblood@dmso.milVice Chair:  Susan Solick	TRADOC Analysis Center	 HYPERLINK "mailto:susan.solick@us.army.mil" susan.solick@us.army.milSecretary:  VacancyThe VV&A PDG is developing a recommended practices guide outlining implementation methodologies for the VV&A of a federation.  IEEE 1516.3, Recommended Practices for HLA Federation Development and Execution Process (FEDEP) recognized VV&A as a key component of federation development and implementation to the extent that placeholders, or "hooks," were included in the FEDEP to support the development of a VV&A overlay.  The proposed VV&A guidance document will mirror the FEDEP, addressing overall VV&A methodology, roles and responsibilities, tasks, and resulting products.  It will be based on lessons learned and established approaches derived from the M&S community.  This guidance document will serve as the foundation for the assessment of credibility of a federation by addressing issues relating to establishing substantive interoperability, promoting reusability, and assuring composability.PAGE  PAGE  52					Support StaffConference Committee “CC”Standards Activity Committee“SAC”Executive Committee“EXCOM”SISO, Inc.
