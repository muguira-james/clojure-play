FIRESTORM capabilities and architecture evolve with and support corresponding advances in technology and Force XXI warfighting requirements.IntroductionThe Federation of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Targeting, Operations, and Research Models (FIRESTORM) is the Intelligence proponent’s answer for needed combat realism, understanding the battle space, training the Senior Army Leadership how they impact the information war and experimenting with ISR applications on the complex digitized battlefield.  It is a prototype ISR simulation with supporting communications infrastructure that is rapidly adaptable to meet a wide variety of Force XXI requirements that include training and combat developments that extend beyond just the tactical intelligence systems.  Although developed as an experimental platform, FIRESTORM quickly proved its value as a training tool.  Commanders learned from it that they must provide detailed guidance to all their information collection and processing assets or they would lose sight of the opposing forces. FIRESTORM successfully served as the primary intelligence simulation driver in many exercises and battle space simulations, including the Division XXI Advanced Warfighting Experiment (DAWE).  With such success came a demand for fielding. The  FIRESTORM technology and experimental platform will become a fielded capability as the Combat Synthetic Training Assessment Range (CSTAR).  This paper provides an overview of the FIRESTORM capability and plans to further develop FIRESTORM as the accepted ISR simulation tool throughout the defense modeling community.ProblemTraditionally, ISR input to simulations and battle command trainers has been fragmented coming from many different sources without players’ inputs.  The combat commanders made few inputs to and had even less control over the ISR elements.  What the intelligence commanders received was without benefit of their direction, intent or judgement. Thus, commanders could never determine the impact of decisions they made and directions they gave to the ISR assets available.  Additionally, simulations do not usually portray combat at a sufficient level of deaggregation to adequately represent the ISR systems contribution to the digitized battlefield.  ISR sensors don’t track aggregated units, only specific entities.  The processing that takes place to combine the entities back into units and determine their intentions must play or the combat leader ‘sees’ perfect intelligence.  Thus, combat realism is lost.  FIRESTORM bridges this fidelity gap that has existed in legacy simulations.  Finally, the Army required an economic means of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of “future” automation systems while these systems are still in the design and development phase.  FIRESTORM met those requirements by providing stimulation feeds to the prototypes of these systems. Then combat commanders could quantify their impacts upon their decisions and the exercises’ outcome.FIRESTORM FunctionalityThere are four primary components of the FIRESTORM federation of models.  These include the constructive simulation, the High Resolution System Stimulator (HRSS), sensor visualization models, and a client infrastructure.  Together, these components create a modular software architecture that operates in real time.  This flexible architecture (depicted in Figure 1) provides an economical venue for experimenting with current and emerging sensor applications.  Also it is a trusted test bed for advanced simulation model prototyping.Constructive SimulationFIRESTORM requires a force on force combat simulation driver.  Currently, FIRESTORM is compatible with a Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) environment, the Aggregate Level Simulation Protocol (ALSP) confederation, and the Corps Battle Simulation (CBS) stand-alone environment.  The FIRESTORM Universal Translator (FSUT) allows FIRESTORM to receive data feeds from these simulation drivers or from any model using the DIS or ALSP protocols.  The translator also provides FIRESTORM knowledge of sensor platforms as they are being portrayed in the combat simulation so they can be accurately replicated in FIRESTORM thus ensuring the FIRESTORM sensor reporting is accurate.High Resolution System Stimulator (HRSS)HRSS is the software technology, which produces entity-level information from aggregate level simulations.  The HRSS is an integral part of FIRESTORM although it was not originally developed under the FIRESTORM project.  The primary function of the HRSS is to provide real time ground truth entity- level data to the various models that comprise the FIRESTORM suite.  During the Division XXI Advanced Warfighting Experiment (DAWE) in October and November 1997, the FIRESTORM suite consisted of eleven models; and HRSS was responsible for tracking over eighty individual sensor platforms.  HRSS provides each sensor platform with battlefield objects reflecting the sensor’s collection capability.  Data feeds to these sensors are continuous and account for any changes in the posture and status of either the sensor or the battlefield entities.  If the combat driver simulation is entity or equipment based such as most DIS-based exercises, HRSS does not have to perform deaggregation to maintain knowledge of entities on the battlefield.  If the combat driver is unit based, however, HRSS must take the aggregate or unit icon and deaggregate it to the individual equipment or entity level before it can maintain knowledge of these battlefield entities.  This deaggregation capability is essential to FIRESTORM’s ability to provide a higher level of fidelity.  FIRESTORM technology allows the commander to know about every tank and its activity instead of receiving a report that there is a battalion of tanks at a particular location.  The HRSS deaggregation capability is based on prior knowledge of what kind of equipment and how many pieces of each equipment type are reflected in a unit icon played by a particular simulation.  Based on this information, HRSS builds “deploy templates” for each known unit.  HRSS also builds generic deploy templates that reflect unit echelon, unit type, and sub-unit information to be used when it encounters an unknown unit during game execution.During game execution, HRSS deploys encountered units and their subordinated units in a pyramid fashion until the last subordinate unit is deployed.  HRSS uses its understanding of the posture or status of the deployed unit to deploy sub-units and unit equipment in a doctrinally correct fashion.  As the simulation progresses, HRSS receives updates to unit information as changes occur.  Examples of unit change information include: unit move message, unit strength or attrition message, unit rename message, and unit resubordination message.  Since the unit is already deployed in HRSS, these changes will be automatically reflected in each individual object and subordinate unit.HRSS uses telemetry messages sent from each sensor to acquire real time knowledge of where the sensor is on the battlefield and specific characteristics of the sensor platform.  Location of the sensor and the radius of its collection capability are important so HRSS can determine the appropriate object data for sensor collection.  Sensors provide the HRSS update information every five to ten seconds, and HRSS will ‘time out” a sensor if it has not provided telemetry data within a specified amount of time.HRSS determines a sensor’s maximum collection capability or footprint and then determines what battlefield objects fall within the footprint.  The objects within the footprint may or may not be reported to the sensor model depending on set threshold data.Sensor Visualization ModelsThese models replicate the physical performance parameters of sensors and sensor platforms and produce the entity specific collection reports based on their detection probabilities.  Collection reports are provided as unclassified and collateral textual and visualization information.  Currently, FIRESTORM hosts twelve sensor models including cross-Battlefield Operation Specialty (BOS) capabilities such as Apache Longbow, Brigade Scouts, Long Range Surveillance/Special Operations Forces, and RAPTOR.  For the purposes of this paper, we will address only the more widely used capabilities to include the JSTARS Sensor Simulation (JSS), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), and the Virtual Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (V-UAV).  Table 1 delineates a complete listing of the currently available sensor models comprising the FIRESTORM suite.Table 1:  FIRESTORM Collection ModelsJoint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSS)Aviation ScoutComanche, Apache, KiowaAirborne Synthetic aperture Radar System (ASARS)Unclassified Signals Intelligence (USIGINT)Collateral (Secret) SIGINT (S-SIGINT)Human Intelligence (HUMINT)Enemy Prisoner of War (EPW),  Interrogation Prisoner of War (IPW)Future Scout Vehicle (FSV)Counterfire RadarVirtual Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (VUAV)Raptor (Countermine) JSTARS Sensor Simulation (JSS)The JSS model simulates the collection and reporting of the JSTARS platform and the Common Ground Station (CGS) operator.  JSS provides Moving Target Indicator (MTI) data and Radar Exploitation Reports (REXREP’s).  JSS was not designed to replicate every capability of the JSTARS platform, but it does provide the ability to paint the battlefield with MTI.  The JSS has individual variables, which can be controlled to determine how much ground truth can be “seen” by the sensor.  Examples of these variables include:Minimum speed of the entityDelta between reported location and actual locationNumber of false radar targets per MTI frameAmount of target clutter and reflection to be added to an MTI frameAdjusting the thresholds of these variables provides more combat realism by forcing the JSS to operate in the “fog of war.”Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) – Unclassified and CollateralThe SIGINT models simulate SIGINT reporting that would ordinarily be received from various SIGINT collectors.  Collection is reported by the models in the form of Tactical Report (TACREP) or Tactical ELINT (TACELINT) messages.  Individual sensor capabilities are not replicated in the models, and collection is performed by a single sensor platform that can “see” the entire battlefield simultaneously.  Output from the Unclassified SIGINT (USIGINT) model must remain unclassified so any modeling of data or analysis is necessarily generic in nature.  The collateral (Secret) SIGINT (S-SIGINT) model operates at a higher level of classification, and the contents of the reports are more detailed.  Although the S-SIGINT model also depends on the generic “one-over-the-battlefield” community footprint, individual sensor platforms can be replicated due to the additional level of detail.  Although the SIGINT models do not provide the same high level of detail as other FIRESTORM models,  they do help support the situation awareness of the warfighter.  The additional level of detail in the S-SIGINT model also provides information which would help analysts further develop a more exact status of the battlefield as well as future enemy intentions.3.3.3  Virtual Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (V-UAV)The V-UAV or Multiple UAV system (MUSE) is a software capability created by the System Integration Lab (SIL) and incorporated into the FIRESTORM suite.  The model permits the capturing and display of UAV video.  When used in conjunction with other sensor data, UAV video provides a powerful confirmation capability which can increase a commander’s battlefield understanding.Client InfrastructureIn addition to its ability to simulate sensor collection in a combat simulation, FIRESTORM can be used to stimulate organic warfighting equipment or equipment surrogates.  Systems that receive sensor output or FIRESTORM stimulation include:  Common Ground Station (CGS) surrogate, All Source Analysis System (ASAS) Block 1, ASAS Remote Workstation (RWS), and the Tactical Control Station (TCS) prototype.  The stimulation of these systems supports real-time visual displays.  With this stimulation capability, FIRESTORM provides a “full-circuit” collection capability; it simulates the sensors that produce the collected data, and it stimulates the processors of that data. FIRESTORM BenefitsWhile simulating sensor collection and stimulating real C4I systems, FIRESTORM provides ISR support in experimentation, combat developments, and training arenas.  Volume, fidelity, and accuracy controls permit sensor simulation in various degrees of “fog of war” and support training audiences of various levels of proficiency.  FIRESTORM provides combat realism in battle command training by forcing commanders to ask the right questions.  FIRESTORM penalizes commanders for poor intelligence asset management because time of sensor employment, location, and tasking greatly influences model output.  Additionally, FIRESTORM rewards good analysis because the cross-cueing and collaboration of sensors and the subsequent fusion of resulting data provides confirmation and potentially more reliable intelligence.  FIRESTORM provides the environment to economically test system prototypes and intelligence concepts, and it provides the foundation of ISR simulation and stimulation which should directly feed into the development of the WARSIM Intelligence Model (WIM) of the Warfighter’s Simulation (WARSIM) 2000.Combat Synthetic Training Assessment Range (CSTAR) ProductizationSuccessful employment of FIRESTORM during the DAWE resulted in the nomination and acceptance of the FIRESTORM capability as a Warfighter Rapid Acquisition Program (WRAP) candidate under the name CSTAR.  The WRAP contract is currently ongoing and will result in the fielding of CSTAR prototypes to Fort Hood and the National Training Center (NTC) in the Spring of 1999.  With the development of CSTAR, the FIRESTORM capability begins to follow parallel paths – the baseline capability evolving into a fielded product as CSTAR and the continued development for experimentation, combat developments, and exercise support purposes.  As a prototyping tool, FIRESTORM will continue to exist even as its functionality is folded into WARSIM/WIM. As a fielded product, CSTAR will evolve into the Intelligence Electronic Warfare Tactical Proficiency Trainer (IEWTPT) which will use WARSIM/WIM as a combat driver.  Figure 2 depicts these parallel FIRESTORM development paths.The CSTAR baseline and objective capabilities are depicted in Table 2.Table 2:  CSTAR Capabilities	Baseline Capability:				Objective Capability:	JSS (MTI)					Additional Models	Unclassified SIGINT Model			Full After Action Capability	MUSE (UAV)					White Cell Interfaces	ASAS (Warlord/Multi-Messaging)		JSAS	HRSS Functionality	JANUS 6.8DX	Mobile Component	CIS to DIS Converter	Graphical Exercise Control	First Level After Action Capability	Corps Battle Simulation (CBS)	Documentation	MMI/GUIThe man-machine interface (MMI) and graphical user interface (GUI) capabilities will facilitate use of the system by non-developers and provide units a home-station training capability by stimulating their organic tactical ISR assets.Future FIRESTORM DevelopmentsTo further enhance FIRESTORM capability and increase combat realism, we plan to develop additional modules, which will increase realistic simulated collection capability.  Currently, additional modules planned for development include Tactical Exploitation of National Capability (TENCAP), Weather, and Counter Intelligence (CI)/ Human Intelligence (HUMINT).TENCAP ModuleThe purpose of the TENCAP module is to enhance the representation of national systems within FIRESTORM.  The effort will focus on the integration of existing models to simulate TENCAP collectors and processors and the stimulation of division and corps TENCAP systems.  Another development issue is the accurate portrayal of national system collection management.Weather ModuleThe goal of the weather module is to improve the realism and fidelity of the existing models by factoring in the effects of weather on the collectors and to provide a stimulation capability for the Integrated Meteorological System (IMETS).  We must determine the specific weather related data in the various combat simulations and modify the FIRESTORM interfaces to read and catalog weather information.  Each sensor model must be modified to receive weather data from HRSS and use it to appropriately degrade collection capability.  Depending on the type and format of the weather format IMETS receives, we may have to improve the fidelity of the weather information from the combat simulation to include data elements such as barometric pressure, altitude, and depth of cloud coverage.  Inclusion of weather effects in FIRESTORM will provide more realistic sensor simulation and stimulation of an additional C4I system.CI/HUMINT ModuleThe goal of the CI/HUMINT module is to increase the commander’s situational awareness by more accurately representing CI/HUMINT collection and to stimulate the CI processor, the CI/HUMINT Automated Tool Set (CHATS), at brigade, division and corps as well as emulate CHATS at the Force Projection Brigade and national levels.  The CI/HUMINT development work will focus on facilitating the measurement of data exchanges between echelons and testing the ability of CI/HUMINT systems to support collaboration between tactical echelons as well as between tactical, theater, and national echelons.ConclusionSince its inception, FIRESTORM provided a robust and economical environment for ISR evaluation and stimulation.  It trains combat commanders to use their intelligence assets or pay the price during exercises.  In today’s information intensive environment, combat commanders learns how to leverage the intelligence force multiplier so future casualties are minimized while achieving the objectives.  FIRESTORM has proven itself as a BCBL-H success story, but the end of the story has yet to be written.  Continued use of FIRESTORM as an experimental and exercise support platform, development of FIRESTORM functionality as a fielded system (CSTAR), and further development of FIRESTORM capability in terms of additional models postures FIRESTORM as the premier ISR simulation tool whose capabilities will transfer to WARSIM/WIM.Figure 1:  How FIRESTORM WorksTextual ReportsASASReconnaissanceModelsIntelligence Models              SIGINT      LRRP/       IMAGERY         TENCAP                                  SOFooooo........JSTARS MTI     FIREFINDERTRIXIS - SIGINTDataCommonGround Station..+l 1293/ a jrj763...oVideoUAV TCSVirtual Reality Engine“Templates” EntitiesHigh Resolution SystemStimulatorCorps Battle SimulationFigure 2:  FIRESTORM Developmental PathsCSTAR Phase IIWIM replaces  TACSIM  Initial Prototype  Experimental PlatformTACSIMWARSIM    WIMIEWTPTCSTARFIRESTORM
