However, the NATO Standard Agreement (STANAG) 5602 Standard Interface for Multiple Platform Link Evaluation (SIMPLE) does not fully describe the radio frequency network environment, which is required to model a more robust Link 11/11B operation.  In addition, the IEEE 1278.1a standard does not provide a way to model the Link 11/11B RF network, only send the data as non standard, user defined Signal Protocol Data Unit (PDU).  A SISO Link 11/11B Product Development Group (PDG) has been formed, and has started working on a DIS and HLA standard for Link 11/11B transport and network modeling.  The Link 11/11B DIS and HLA standard will be developed using many of the Link 16 methods and procedures.  This paper presents a Link 11/11B model approach, including implementation of various Link 11/11B TDL message types (e.g. Roll Call, Net Sync, Short Broadcast).  In addition, the first draft of the DIS Signal and Transmitter PDUs, and HLA Link 11/11B BOM will be presented.1.	IntroductionOver the past few years, a protocol for simulating Link 16 in IEEE 1278.1 – 1995, Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS), and IEEE 1516, High Level Architecture (HLA) has been developed, and recently approved as a Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization (SISO) Standard; SISO-STD-002-2005.  It has been recognized that there are requirements for simulating Link 11/11B in DIS and HLA.  The DIS simulation protocol for Link 11/11B will develop DIS and HLA definitions, guidance, and standardization.  Similarly, Link 11/11B will be described in terms of the established DIS Transmitter and Signal Protocol Data Units (PDUs).  There is no change to the IEEE 1278.1 – 1995 standard fields for the Transmitter or Signal PDUs.  Link 11/11B specific enumerations will be created to populate the standard fields. The implementation of Link 11/11B will take advantage of the fact that both these PDUs are variable length.  In the case of the Transmitter PDUs, this protocol sets forth how the variable length “modulation parameter” fields will be populated.   In the case of the Signal PDU, Link 11/11B specific information is relegated to the variable length data fields.   Link 11/11B has some similarities to Link 16, but there are some differences, which will be described, along with Link 11/11B terms and definitions.Link 11/11B DescriptionLink 11/11B encompasses two types of Tactical Digital Information Link (TADIL):  Link 11, and Link 11B, otherwise known as TADIL A and TADIL B.  Link 11 employs netted communication techniques and standard message formats for the exchange of digital information among airborne, land-based, submarine, and shipboard tactical data systems. It provides for the mutual exchange of information among net participants via High Frequency (HF) or Ultra-High-Frequency (UHF) radio. Link 11 is a half-duplex, netted, secure link that operates in a Roll Call mode among all Participating Units (PUs), under the control of a Net Control Station (NCS). In Roll Call, pickets are polled sequentially and respond with their Link-11 messages.  Link 11B is a full-duplex, two-way, point-to-point link that provides for the serial transfer of data between units of the U.S. Army (USA), U.S. Air Force (USAF), U.S. Marine Corps (USMC), and the United States National Security Agency (NSA). Its participants are referred to as Reporting Units (RUs). Because it is point-to-point, each pair of RUs operates on a separate Link 11B channel, often referred to as a “B-Link.” Data is forwarded among the RU pairs by Forwarding RUs (FRUs).  Link 11B employs the same message standard as Link 11. However, the equipment, some message protocols, and the data rate are different from those of Link 11, thus requiring special forwarding units to interface with Link 11 and Link 11B.  TADIL B is not employed directly by Naval or Allied units.  Because Link 11 and Link 11B employ the same message standard and have virtually identical operational capabilities, they are often referred to together as Link 11/11B. An interface between them is provided by a Forwarding Participating Unit (FPU) and, from an operational standpoint, they may be viewed as a single Link. Operations involving only Link 11 and Link 11B are referred to as Link 11/11B operations.  These are fully described in MIL- STD-6011C [1].Link 11/11B Message StructureLink 11/11B messages contain 48 bits of tactical information.  Link 11 and Link 11B messages are formatted differently for transmission on the tactical networks. A Link 11 formatted message consists of two 30-bit frames. Each frame contains 24 bits of data along with 6 Hamming Error Detection and Correction (EDAC) bits. The Link 11 message frame is shown in Table 1. EDAC24 Bit Tactical Data29--------2423-----------------------------------------029--------2423-----------------------------------------0	Table 1.  Link 11 Frame StructureA Link 11B formatted message consists of 72 bits, containing eight groups of 9 bits each.  The start group use 9 bits, but is not included in real world Link 11B messages.  The check group uses 9 bits while each of the six data groups uses 1 bit each to precede the 8 information bits. The first 4 bits of the Link 11/11B tactical message contain the message label.  The rest of the bits are defined by size and description fields specific to the message, for a total of 48 bits of tactical information. The Link 11B message structure is shown in Table 2.  Link 11/11B FieldSize, in BitsData Group 1Mark bit (1), 8 data bitsData Group 2Mark bit (1), 8 data bitsData Group 3Mark bit (1), 8 data bitsData Group 4Mark bit (1), 8 data bitsData Group 5Mark bit (1), 8 data bitsData Group 6Mark bit (1), 8 data bitsCheck Group 8 parity bitsTable 2.

On Link 11B, a directly tied unit is considered active upon proper initialization of a point-to-point link and an M.0 has been received within the last 60 seconds.  On Link 11B, a unit that is not directly tied is considered active when an appropriate M.5 has been received.Inactive Status:	A unit received over Link 11 may be considered to be inactive after 60 seconds have gone by without the receipt of an M.1 or if a Drop Track message has been received for that unit.  A unit received over Link 11B may be considered inactive if (1) it is a directly tied unit and no M.0 has been received for 60 seconds; (2) a Drop Track message is received for that unit; (3) the unit is being received over a data link for which the directly tied unit goes inactive.Address:	A number applied to a PU or RU to associate information and directives with interface units or tracks for both digital and voice communications.Data Net Control Station (DNCS):  The participating unit performing the initiation and termination of the data net and controlling the order in which units are called.Data Link Reference Point (DLRP):  The DLRP is a fixed geographic reference point, specified by appropriate authority, from which the PU on Link 11/11B can calculate the relative position of ownship and local tracks, and from which all tracks are reported on Link 11/11B.Force Track Coordinator (FTC):  A representative of the AAWC who is repsonsible for management of force trackingFrame:  A 30 bit word consisting of 24 data bits and 6 Hamming Error Detection and Correction (EDAC)  bits.Lateral Tell:  The process of sharing or telling information between the Link 11/11B RADIL System and the Joint Surveillance System.Link 11/11B:  See TADILNet Control Station (NCS):  A Link 11/11B station which acts as the interrogating station during roll callNet Cycle Time:  The length of time between reporting opportunities, as measured by each PU.Net Sync (NS):	A Link 11/11B net mode of operation for synchronizing all stations that are on the link.

Because of this, there has been some discussion of how long Link 11/11B will be used, not only by U.S. Services, but NATO countries as well.  The SISO Tactical Data Link (TDL) Study Group (SG) voted to standardize Link 11/11B, and use the same approach as Link 16.  However, three options are currently being discussed.  They are:Develop a DIS and HLA standard modeling the network as well as message exchange, and developing interoperable levels of fidelity.Develop a DIS and HLA standard with one level of fidelity, which models message exchange only.  Design should be capable of adding additional levels of fidelity if required.Do not develop a DIS and HLA standard for Link 11/11B.Most of the responses from the TDL SG supported option 2.  However, the Link 11/11B PDG held at the Spring 2006 SIW showed that 2 fidelity levels would be ideal and not hard to model.  In addition, changes from the Link 11/11B Spring PDG have been incorporated into the DIS Signal and Transmitter PDU templates. The following sections define Link 11/11B general requirements; DIS Signal and Transmitter PDUs, and a HLA BOM for one level of fidelity.  The design allows for additional fidelity levels if deemed necessary.General RequirementsThis section describes general requirements for simulation of Link 11/11B independent of the simulation protocol used.  These general requirements support basic Link 11/11B operation, and additional requirements may be added from the results of Link 11/11B PDG meetings.All Link 11/11B messages shall be bit encoded in accordance with the MIL-STD-6011 Ref [1] Tactical Data Link 11/11B specification. The specification describes the message structure as defined in section 2.1 and in Appendix A.All Transmission modulation parameters shall be filled with data described in section 3.2.Systems shall transmit data upon receipt of a roll call message from the NCS.  During the remainder of the time, the PU shall receive reports from other members.The types of transmissions that shall occur during Roll Call are NCS Call Up (Interrogation), Picket Reply, and the NCS report.The Short Broadcast shall be a single data transmission to all members of the net by a station that may be acting as a Picket Unit or NCS.The Broadcast net mode shall consist of a continuous series of Short Broadcast messages contained in one Signal PDU.  To simulate the two frames of dead time required, each Signal PDU shall contain the series of Short Broadcast messages; wait for a period of two updates as defined in Ref [7], then shall transmit another Signal PDU containing a series of Short Broadcast messages.  For HLA, the message transmission shall pause for a time that is defined as dead time.Transmitter/Signal PDU pairs shall be sent for Roll Call and Short Broadcast messages.  Transmitter PDUs shall be required for the first Broadcast Signal PDU.  Subsequent Transmitter PDUs from the same PU are not required, until the end, where another Transmitter PDU shall be sent to be in compliance with Ref [7].All systems shall have some representation of periodic clock time.Reasonable timeouts shall be established and entered into the NCS for PU response times.  Link 11/11B DIS Transmitter PDU Design ApproachThe existing Transmitter PDU fields that are Link 11/11B specific are the Radio Entity Type, which shall be set to 22 (Proposed Enumeration) for Link 11/11B Radio.  The Frequency shall be set to 4 MHz, and the Transmit Frequency Bandwidth shall be set to 28 KHz for Link 11 HF, 175KHz for Link 11 UHF, 16 KHz for Link 11B, and 25 KHz for Link 11 SATCOM.  The Spread Spectrum field shall be set to zero, for no spread spectrum in use.  The Modulation parameter fields shall be set to 1 for Major Modulation, 11 (proposed) for Dual Side Band, Suppressed Carrier, and 9 (proposed) for system.  For the Link 11/11B Transmitter PDU, five modulation fields have been added to the Transmitter PDU.  They are:  Record Type, Fidelity Level; Link 11/11B Terminal Mode, Data Terminal Set Indicator, and Mode of Operation.Record Type:  This field shall define the type of message, either Link 11 or Link 11B.Fidelity Level: Two levels of fidelity are supported. Level 0 for message exchange only and level 1 to model polling on Link 11.Link11/11B Terminal Mode: The Link 11/11B terminal mode includes NCS, Participating Unit and Reporting Unit.Data Terminal Set Indicator:  The Data Terminal Set Indicator has seven enumerations that describe the seven Link 11/11B terminal indicators:  Transmit, Receive, Net Busy, Transmit Data Error, Receive Data Error, Code Error, and Synchronization Complete.Modes of Operation:  The modes of operation are Net Sync, Net Test, Roll Call, Short Broadcast, and Broadcast.Padding:  24 bits of padding are added so that the modulation parameter fields end on a 64 bit-boundary and are a multiple of 8, as required by Ref [7]. The enumerations for some of the fields have not yet been submitted to the DIS EBV Documentation Editor.  These fields may change, be deleted, or other fields may be added, depending on subsequent Link 11/11B PDG Discussions.   Once these fields have been defined, proposed DIS EBV enumerations will be submitted as required.  The first draft of the Link 11/11B Transmitter PDU template is shown in Appendix A.Link 11/11B DIS Signal PDU Design ApproachThe Signal PDU fields for Link 11/11B are defined with two levels of fidelity.  To support two levels of fidelity, levels zero and one, the fields added are the Message Sub Type, Picket Number, Word Count, Sequence Number, Message Type Identifier, and Net Cycle Time.  A padding field has been added to ensure that the Signal PDU is on a 32-bit boundary, Ref [7], and to be used to add additional Link 11/11B fields are required.Message Sub Type: 	The Message Sub Type is an 8 bit unsigned integer field and shall indicate the label messages occurring between the Start and Stop Messages within each transmission sequence as follows: 0=Intermediate, 1=Interrogate Message, 2=Start Code, 3=Picket Stop Code, 4=Control Stop CodePicket Number:  The Picket Number field is a 16 bit enumerated field, and shall identify the Participating Unit Number of any Link 11/11B unit in any mode of operation.  For Interrogate Messages, the PU Number shall indicate the unit being polled.  For all other Sub-Types, the PU Number shall identify the originating PUWord Count:  An 8 bit unsigned integer field that shall indicate the number of 16 bit words of Message Data in increments of 4.  For Interrogate Messages that contain no M-Series messages, this field shall be set to zero.  For Fidelity Level zero, all F’s shall be filled into this field indicating a wild card value. Sequence Number:  A counter that each NCS/PKT DTS increments for every Link-11 message it generates.  This shall be used at the NTDS application to determine transmit/receive of Link-11 messages and monitoring of any missing data.  In the event of missing data, the operator would be notified, but the current data shall be delivered as usual.  Upon reaching a value of 255 the counter shall roll over back to zero on the next message transmitted.  For Fidelity Level zero, all F’s shall be filled into this field indicating a wild card value.Message Type Identifier:  The Message Type Identifier field is an 8-bit enumeration and shall identify whether message is Net Test, Roll Call, Picket Reply, Short Broadcast, or Broadcast.Net Cycle Time:  Net cycle time contains the time required for the NCS to complete a polling sequence of all PUs, and shall consist of two 32-bit fields.  The first 32-bit field shall be an integer field, and shall be represented in seconds relative to 0h on 1 January 1900 UTC. The second 32-bit field shall be an integer field, and shall contain the fraction part of the time.  For Fidelity Level zero, all Fs (4294967295) shall be entered into this field, indicating a wildcard (No Statement).Message Data:  The Link 11/11B messages are added to the end of the Signal PDU, and shall be read in as 32 bit unsigned integer arrays.  The Link 11 and Link 11B message templates are shown in the Signal PDU table.The second draft of the Link 11/11B Signal PDU template is shown in Appendix A.  Also shown are the Link 11 and Link 11B messages, and how they should be included in the Signal PDU.  Once the message has been inserted, the length should be padded such that the entire Signal PDU (Signal PDU plus Link 11 or 11B message) is divisible by 32.Link 11/11B BOMThe Link 11/11B BOM design approach should describe how to implement a simulation of the Link 11/11B Tactical Data Link (TDL) and its associated message set, Link 11/11B, within a High Level Architecture (HLA) simulation. The Link 11/11B BOM should be designed for integration within the Federation Object Model (FOM) of the HLA federation.AssumptionsThe Link 11/11B BOM assumes that:1.	The parent FOM contains all current DIS Transmitter PDU PDU records (not those associated with the PDU header) in accordance with Ref 1as part of its object class hierarchy.2.	The parent FOM contains all current DIS Signal PDU PDU records (not those associated with the PDU header) in accordance with Ref 1as part of its interaction class hierarchy.Naming ConventionConventions within the Link 11/11B BOM in OMT 1.3 format follow those adopted by the RPR FOM versions 1.0 and 2.0. These conventions are intended to address some of the OMT 1.3 format shortcomings, which have been addressed in the IEEE 1516.2 specification. These include: 1.	All names have the initial letter of each word capitalized.2.	All enumeration names end in the text "Enum" followed by a number. The number indicates the number of bits in the enumerated value.3.	All complex data type names end in the text "Struct".Levels of FidelityThe Link 11/11B BOM initial design approach is for one level of fidelity.Protocol Implementation ProceduresThe first draft of protocol implementation features was designed in parallel with the existing Link 16 BOM.  They should be equivalent to the corresponding details for Link 11/11B DIS implementation.Object Class Data ApproachThe Link 11/11B BOM first draft, shown in Appendix C, defines no new object classes. Instead the BOM defines a single complex data type (Link11TransmitterStruct) that corresponds to the modulation parameters in the DIS Transmitter PDU defined in section 3.2. An attribute of this complex data type should be added to the object class in the parent FOM corresponding to the DIS Transmitter PDU, corresponding to assumption 1 in section 3.3.1.Modulation parameters of the Transmitter PDU, described in section 3.1 and shown in Appendix A, should map to the fields of the Link11TransmitterStruct complex data type attribute. Parent object class fields should also be modified such that they refer to the corresponding Transmitter PDU fields (see Assumption 1 in section 3.3.1).NOTE: For a RPR FOM implementation, it is suggested that an attribute of the Link11TransmitterStruct complex data type should be added to the RadioTransmitter object class.Interaction Class DataThe Link 11/11B BOM, first draft, is added to the family of interactions that support TDL implementation of other datalinks.  The Link 11/11B interactions are added to the family of interactions that, in which, a hierarchy of the BOM’s base class.  The interaction is a generic class - the TDLBinaryRadioSignal interaction. This class is an empty class, contains no parameters, and is neither publishable nor subscribable. The specific parameters are properties of the various subclasses of this generic base class, and it is these subclasses that are published and subscribed to.  The Link11RadioSignal interaction, shown in Appendix B, which is a subclass of the TDLBinaryRadioSignal interaction, contains the Link 11/11B Network Header Parameters as defined in section 3.2. The Link11MessageRadioSignal interaction should be designed to contain the Link 11/11B message data.  Additional interactions shown in Appendix B define the other types of Link 11/11B messages.The Link 11/11B BOM design is such that the TDLBinaryRadioSignal interaction becomes a subclass of the parent FOM's equivalent of the DIS Signal PDU (see Assumption 2 in section 3.4.1).Adding the Link 11/11B BOM to the RPR FOMAdding the Link 11/11B BOM to the RPR FOM consists of three steps: adding the Link 11/11B Radio Signal interaction, adding a Link11TransmitterData structure, and adding the contents of the tables listed in Appendix B.  Adding the interaction is the same for both RPR FOM versions 1.0 and 2.0.  The manner of adding the Link11TransmitterData structure should be different between the two RPR FOM versions.  The TDLBinaryRadioSignal class shall be added as a subclass of the RawBinaryRadioSignal interaction class; this is done in order to allow access to the HostRadioIndex parameter in the RawBinaryRadioSignal interaction class. The HostRadioIndex parameter ties the Link 11/11B message to a specific Host and Radio Transmitter.The Link11ABRadioSignal interaction class is added as a subclass of a new interaction class, the TDLBinaryRadioSignal interaction, which itself is a subclass of the RPR FOM's RawBinaryRadioSignal interaction class, as shown in Appendix B.The addition of the TDLBinaryRadioSignal interaction class and its associated subclasses, shown in Appendix B were necessary because of the RPR FOM implementation limitations of the DIS Signal PDU.  Section 3.2 defines the DIS Signal PDU used for all Link 11/11B messages in a Raw Binary Signal PDU. The RPR FOM equivalent of this PDU type (the RawBinaryRadioSignal interaction class) contains a parameter, called SignalData, containing one or more octets containing the signal data. If the SignalData octet based storage scheme to store Link 11/11B messages was used, then the Link 11/11B message would be lost during byte swapping.  The implementation is defined such that the Link 11/11B interaction becomes a subclass of the RawBinaryRadioSignal interaction to ensure the SignalData storage is not used.  Data integrity is achieved by moving the Link 11/11B message storage into the lowest level classes (i.e the JTIDSMessageRadioSignal).Also, DIS to HLA gateways will require modifications.  One modification required is that DIS Raw Binary Signal PDUs need to be split into a RawBinaryRadioSignal interaction or the appropriate Link 11/11B interaction class, depending on the TDL type.  Conversely, a HLA to DIS gateway must merge both interaction types into a single DIS Signal PDU.  Another modification required is the Link 11/11B is that if the message label, TN, and identity (Groups 1 and 2) are split from the rest of the Link 11/11B message, as done for Link 16, then Group 1 and 2 would be read in (18 bits), then the rest of the message read in as a 32 bit array, with padding added to form a 32 bit boundary.  Subsequent Link 11/11B PDGs shall address this issue.Adding the Link 11/11B BOM to the RPR FOM versions 1 and 2Adding the Link 11/11B BOM to RPR FOM versions 1 and 2 should parallel the Link 16 additions, such that they are consistent and interoperable with each set of BOMs.  Appendix B shows all required tables, with some that still require design and enumeration assignments.  Subsequent Link 11/11B PDGs shall design and complete these tables.Existing Link 11/11B BOMThe Naval Aviation Simulation Master Plan (NASMP) Technical working group has created a Link 11/11B Guidance, Rational, and Interoperability Manual (GRIM) [2], written by Mr. Jamie Burns, P-3C TORT Federate Developer.  The NASMP Link 11 GRIM provides guidance on how the BOM supports roll call, broadcast, short broadcast, and radio silence modes of the Link-11 tactical data link.  4.	Current StatusThe first Link 11/11B PDG was conducted at the Fall 2005 SISO SIW.  Most discussions were on design approach, levels of fidelity, and officer elections.  The elected officers are:PDG Chair:	Joe SorrochePDG Vice Chair:	Joe ZehnlePDG Secretary:	Dr. Rob ByersPDG TAD:	Mark McCallLink 11/11B PDG activities were suspended after the SISO Fall 2005 SIW due to Mr. Sorroche’s and Dr. Byers’ involvement in completing the Link 16 standard.  Once the Link 16 Standard has been formally approved, the Link 11/11B PDG will proceed.   5.
