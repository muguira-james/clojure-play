UncertaintyAbstract“Moving off the planet” presents NASA with a grand adventure, a defining moment for this century, but with “wicked” simulation challenges that are familiar to those engaged in other multi-decadal massively complex enterprises. Complex problems, specific to space, have elements in common to all large system simulation projects. They have no easy answers. This papers addresses 5 of them: (1) the nature of the problems, (2) development and maintenance of a shared vision or story, (3) model fidelity, (4) the uncertainty of outcomes and (5) concerns related to highly dispersed interactive multi-national, multi-disciplinary and multi-cultural teams that must share a common vision and operate over decades as teams, technology and missions change. Introduction: The Situation	If understanding complexity were easy; if doing dangerous complicated work were easy; if long-duration projects proved easy to do -- simulation would be unnecessary. If the answers were obvious; no one would go through the pain, effort and expense of creating simulation. Difficult, hazardous long-term projects, however, have a persistent need for simulation from the first insight into a possibly workable idea until the final report—perhaps decades later—is put in the archive.	Again and again, at simulation conferences, people ask, “When does NASA use simulation?” Again and again, they express surprise at the answer: “All the time.” NASA has long accepted that when humans have to go where humans cannot go that simulation is the sole solution. With that experience comes the awareness that simulation surprises us. Surprise is its essence. With it, people see things from a new, previously unimagined perspective. They understand concepts that had eluded them and grasp how to do work that seemed impossible.	NASA uses simulation to achieve consensus, understand problems, make decisions, support design, planning and troubleshooting as well as for operations, training, testing and evaluation.	 NASA, as everywhere, creates its simulation in small pockets. People work in cold cramped simulation laboratories, in modest cubicles or in a small cluster of, at most, a few visionaries, planners, project managers, scientists, computer scientists, artists and engineers. These groups communicate infrequently, if at all, with others doing similar work. 	Often teams struggle with “wicked” problems, aware, perhaps, that others down the hall, across the city or ocean may have a useful clue. It is only commonsense to deliberately increase networks of diverse and expert colleagues, reliable information resources and the credibility and visibility of the work.  1. The “Wickedness” of “Wicked Problems”  	Traditional problem solving often states that identifying the problem is halfway to solving it. This is not the experience of far-flung teams working on disjointed elements of a very large system.  They face “wicked” problems that are daunting to define, complex, serious, unique and consequential. Such problems related to simulation for Space exploration share attributes with other multi-decadal massively complex enterprises intermingling many variables and many potential solutions.           Rittel and Webber in the often-cited Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning stated, “Planning problems are inherently ‘wicked’.” [1] They so identify them because they cannot be definitively described, defined or solved. They are essentially unique and, always, consequential. Every effort to solve a “wicked” problem has cost, impact, and, often, penalty. Marginal short-term improvement can make needed structural change more difficult and expensive.  Consequences can be unexpected. Solving one problem may create other, different and more difficult problems. The authors were discussing social policy, but these ideas resonate with NASA experience.	Seeming similarities among “wicked” problems can be deceiving. The unique properties of a particular complex situation may override apparent commonalities among seemingly similar situations. Moving off the planet does seem to be like going to the Moon during the Apollo era. That may be, but, probably, it is not. The science is the same but the technologies are different as are the teams. All the systems and subsystems are different.  The differences may far outweigh similarities. Although teams need to know as much as possible about potential similarities; they must remain aware that direct transfer of any past solutions might prove not only useless but harmful.	 It is important to face these “wicked” problems even though they defy measurement and are beyond our ability to fix absolutely. Ignoring them will not make them go away.	 Incremental betterment is a viable, if uneasy, choice beset with its own “wicked” problems. With “wicked” problems, according to Rittel and Webber, no scientifically provable stopping point exists.  The aim “is not Truth but improvement.” This is a difficult idea for professional problem solvers, engineers and technical managers to accept. 	Many do believe that “wicked problems” require mindful and skillful step-by-step analysis and action toward betterment. Charles Lindblom [2] suggested that conscious and disciplined analysis; trial and error as well as tests and retests among many participants can successfully and incrementally address complex disjointed problems inherent in very large complex systems.  No one yet seems to have a better answer.2.The Shared Story	If a team is to take on a “wicked” problem; the members need to know why.  They need to see the value of the story and understand the roles they are to play.. NASA’s story is to move off the planet. It will be a defining moment of this century. We will no longer be visitors but residents. This is a truly awesome idea. The changes that will follow are incalculable. 	To achieve a shared model such as this, a team must start the correct story correctly and constantly keep it up-to-date and on target.  That is easy to say. It is not so easy to do, but it matters. Teams lacking a shared vision or model lose focus. Without focus they can lose sight of their mission and goals. Loss of sight equals blindness.  Again and again, mishap studies show that teams without a shared model face a likelihood of failure.	A shared vision is the driver in collaboration.  It is critical to a sporting victory, a successful opening night, a political campaign or a commercial technology break-through just as it is to the grand adventure of space exploration. According to a recent Forrester study, Getting Real Work Done in Virtual Worlds [3], “strategy documentation” is accepted as a best practice for describing what is driving the virtual team activity. This includes the vision statement, definition, scope, principles, business case, gap analysis, road maps and “next step” plus models and simulations. Organizations, too often, overlook or trivialize this activity. Such document strategy is an opportunity-- that a collaborative environment can support-- to challenge the status quo, elicit ideas and determine how best to initiate, maintain and accelerate momentum. 	With sufficient attention, an organization can tell the correct, the shared, story in terms of logic and surprise to evoke right action.   When such a story works, it resonates and creates energy. Over time, no one remembers where the story began or with whom. That is all right. The listener’s story is what matters.  What the listener does is the heart of the matter. It takes discipline, skill and effort to create a story so clear, so sound intellectually and emotionally that people can carry out the mission for years and years telling, retelling and acting on it as their own.3. Model Uncertainty An inherently “wicked” problem exists because simulation builds on models. Defining a model as a simplification of reality and a simulation as a dynamic simplification of reality implies selection and abstraction resulting in something less than reality.   Acceptance and use of simulation --especially for something as hazardous as moving off the planet --is inextricably linked with model fidelity.NASA initially uses simulation to enable others to comprehend through the intellect something that does not yet exist in reality. This idea may begin with hand-drawn sketches, brief written descriptions, simple computer animations and rough conceptual models. The goal is to assess possibility and probability in terms of scientific, economic, social and organizational acceptability. Large system projects progress through models of increasing fidelity, some simply “good enough” and others accurate to the inch or millimeter. The intent is to create an almost intuitive understanding of the story, its plan and products. Everyone, everywhere, bases decisions on models. John Sterman, systems scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in an important address, All Models Are Wrong, Reflections on Becoming a systems scientist, asserted,  “Models are lies.”  [4]Models are inevitably simplifications, incomplete and therefore incorrect. The paradox is asking people to bet on a tool that uses illusion to make something seem more real. Citing “inability to validate any model in terms of truthfulness,” Sterman urged readers to help one another develop critical thinking skills and confidence to challenge the models and to uncover their biases.  All models, all representations, simplify reality and hopefully leave nothing out that is of consequence, nothing that will impact the outcome in any appreciable way. No guarantee exists and not worrying about that would be foolish. The goal should be to find the flaws in the models and to work together for improvement.Individual and team worldviews, experience and myriad other factors determine the choices that people make in selecting subjects for research or development and the methods they follow. These factors frame the variables people consider and can obscure experiences and ideas that might alter findings and make them change their minds. People are always at risk of missing something and being blind to both problems and opportunities. This, too, is a “wicked” problem because, as Daniel Goleman notes, so much that people are aware of happens outside their awareness. Being open to the knowledge and insights of others is difficult but necessary to avoid either narrowness of vision or “group think.” Both can result in ineffective development of criteria and options, reduce opportunities for innovation or hurt decision-making.  Either can--and often does--result in unanticipated and undesirable consequences. [5] Not acting, while seeking in vain for truth or definitive answers, would be foolish. Sterman further warned, “Developing the capacity to see the world through multiple lenses and to respect differences cannot become an excuse for indecision, for a retreat into impotent scholasticism. We have to take personal responsibility.” [4]Models fail when people fail to ask hard questions about the suitability of the model to the stated purpose, build on faulty data, are blind to biases and prejudices, are ignorant of critical assumptions or have paid scant attention to those who need the model. Testing the shortcomings in models and systems is no dishonor but, rather, a means to decrease chances for error and failure.   4. Outcome UncertaintyA central challenge of massive complexity is getting all those pieces to work effectively together. A system or project is not complex merely because it is large or intricate or has many entities. It is the integration of all those elements that makes it complex. Complexity resides in the uncertainty of the outcome. For example, making wire rope and strand from steel, producing potato chips and making Tootsie Rolls involve complicated and intricate machinery, supplies and processing, but the outcome is not in doubt. As the machinery roars or hums along and people correctly follow the correct procedures-- things are separated, reformed, heated, cooled, extruded, sorted, packaged and distributed in an apparently seamless and rhythmic movement. Someone has worked out all the kinks. [6] A massively complex enterprise, also builds on the assumption that any change can change everything.  It recognizes that the aggregation of the parts will produce something different from what anyone can determine ahead of time. No one can guarantee outcomes.  The interconnected parts may interact in unanticipated ways. The Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) reported the finding that while components may function when they standalone and, technicians may anticipate failure modes, that “when components are integrated into a total system and work in concert, unanticipated interactions can occur that can lead to catastrophic outcomes." [7] Anticipating all possible unforeseen consequences is both impossible and unnerving.Others involved in massively -complex activities face similar, if admittedly different, massively “wicked” problems. A few examples of these massively complex enterprises are tunneling under the San Andreas Fault, building the US Navy’s first electric ship, rebuilding New Orleans or Baghdad, achieving world peace, curing cancer and interdisciplinary efforts among scientists, engineers and industry leaders to prevent or mitigate environmental disaster, or among those trying to find a way to balance insatiable demand for power and energy against diminishing resources. These all demand innovative response and attention to massive complexity, dispersed teams, a long timeline, and dependence on models and simulation.Paradoxically, simplicity is also a factor.  A.J. Clarke’s third law states that mature technology is indistinguishable from magic. Writing is one example.   In its day in ancient Athens, writing was a new and controversial technology. Today, no one thinks about it.  People just do it. The electric light is another example. We want simulation supporting multi-decadal massively complex projects to be like that.  No one can, yet, simply flick a switch and collaborate virtually and magically. In fact, today’s trend seems, instead, toward more functions  (a television remote, for example, may have 45 buttons) rather than giving attention to the goals toward which collaborative teams and individuals must strive.  Fewer parts make easier assembly with less opportunity for failure. Horatio Greenough’s insistence that “form follow function” suggests that reducing entities to exactly what the task requires could keep some complexity in check, reduce waste, rework and training time as well as prevent unwanted and costly changes.  This complexity versus simplicity dilemma evokes an Albert Einstein's quote often paraphrased as "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not one bit simpler." [8] Teams need systems that are easy to use and grow with them That matters because otherwise people will stop or never begin using the collaborative systems available to them. Such discarded tools and collaborative environments litter our organizations. The goal is Da Vinci’s “simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.” Sometimes complexity is the best people can currently achieve, but simplicity is worth considering. 5. Persistent Dependence on Highly Dispersed Teams Large complex systems will increasingly require persistent dependence on highly dispersed multi-national, multi-disciplinary and multi-cultural teams that must share a common vision and operate over decades as teams, technology and missions change. Such a challenge assumes no easy answers. Interactivity among virtual teams poses special  “wicked” difficulties. Most books on the subject assume a choice between being virtual or working face-to-face. It is not so simple. Not one of the hundreds of books in print on the subject of virtual teams assumes a persistently virtual team. Space exploration will mean that some teams, especially those 34 million miles apart, can only connect virtually. It is not a choice. Face-to-face is preferable, but it is important to face the difficulties and start from there. A new Gartner study, Anytime, Anyplace, the Interactive Enterprise affirms, the value of innovative collaborative management with the promise of betterment in challenging situations.  Their finding is that truly collaborative organizations with people communicating, working and using the knowledge that they have produced, open markets and create viable partnerships. This could translate to greater understanding of what the work is all about, what the customers really need and, by supporting and fostering greater agility and effective interactivity would enable organizations to grow businesses cheaper and better. Such focused enterprises could transform skeptics on virtual collaboration to believers. [10]NASA, like most organizations, has wrung out many of the problems (and related savings) in the later stages of development. More promising opportunities for “wicked” problem betterment exist in the more fluid early stages. Many “wicked” problems are rooted in the ambiguity and uncertainty common in the early stages when an organization knows the difference between the unsatisfactory present and the desired future but has no idea how to get there. A growing body of knowledge based in the United States, Europe, and Asia and elsewhere affirms the value of disciplined intense early planning by a diverse team, including the customer. With the mismatch clear, the team’s work is clear. Exactly how best to move forward is the question.A disciplined front-end approach implies insight, conscious disciplined analysis and synthesis with clear, visible agreement on what decisions need to be made and by whom, consensus on where to spend time, and how many iterations of loops will prove truly valuable. [3]This is a critical time in the decision process when people need to consider many alternatives, criteria and options and when fragmentary information (entities and processes) needs to be enumerated, analyzed and presented. 	Multidisciplinary teams working intensively together from the beginning of projects could drive out ambiguity and uncertainty, clarify issues and criteria leading to fewer unplanned changes. Such an approach amounts to another version of “measure twice and cut once.” Few people or organizations have seized this leadership opportunity.  It requires a different mindset.  It requires willingness to grab hold of a potentially better but untried future rather than tolerate a known if unsatisfactory present. Such action could build better acceptance and understanding of “wicked” problems. It could build trust among the team members translating to lower cost, better more innovative performance and greater team satisfaction.Simulation and interoperability must go hand in hand with intelligent effort, uncommon common sense and conscious, careful attention to the work at hand NoneSpace requires that everything work together: data, simulation, hardware (including robots) and fragile humans. Whatever the technology, it is important that highly dispersed, collaborative team members share an increasingly clear and viable model of what they are doing and why.Furthering the complexity but enhancing the challenge are the many disciplines, cultures and languages that must become aware of one another’s complexities in order to practice and master understanding and betterment. 6. Antepenultimate Point: More Problems This examination of the grand challenges facing very large, very complex systems is at its beginning. Much remains to be done. A NASA study, in 2004, of its simulation tools database, changed direction to consider what virtual teams really need in order to collaborate. NASA, working under an Alaskan Slope Regional Corporation (ASRC) University System Technology Development Contract  (USTDC) with the Institute for Simulation and Training (IST) at the University of Central Florida (UCF), stopped looking at requirements for the tools and looked instead at how to implement a system that would actually enable virtual teams to work successfully together on multi-decadal massively complex projects.The USTD team defined collaborative functions as actions taken with others to solve a problem that if left unaddressed would impede success. They studied the problems a team must solve if any kind of collaboration is to work, no matter what the mission. Looking at the goals of such teams, the USTD team enumerated hundreds of entities, functional activities, and sorted them and gathered feedback. They determined that the desired environment for innovation must be a place to actively encourage critical reflection and knowledge construction through interaction with others. This approach focused on outcomes (not tools). From some, it elicited the comment, “That is what we have been telling you all along.” Others said, “Oh, no, we have been doing it all wrong.” Some perceived that concentrating on the technology and not on what people needed in order to achieve their goals helped explain why efforts to develop a viable collaborative environment had repeatedly failed. [5]The research team captured all collaborative team activity within four discrete categories or stages organized in order of increasing complexity: •. Share data and meaning through focused access to information resources and informal dialogue and brief communication exchange with other members.• Coordinate efficiently in order to make good use of everyone’s time•. Provide opportunity to add value, easily working with others anywhere and anytime to create tangible products capable of being tracked. •. Create accessible and safe digital memory storage of what the team has done. No current collaboration tool system does all that. Pieces of such interactive systems exist along with good databases and simulation models but nothing that is “magic”, promotes continuous interactivity, is easy to use that could survive for 100 years. Moreover the Agency asks its record managers to devise methods to store that knowledge for 1000 years or more. That is another “wicked” problem.Such projects also need many new and easier tools. NASA must design, develop and deploy innumerable one-of-a-kind products -- including simulation -- each with one-of-a-kind sub-elements. Teams working on such massively complex projects handle thousands of entities. These include specifications, plans, budgets, agreements, contracts, sketches, definitions, blueprints, designs, and documentation of milestones, presentations, tests, prototypes, 3-D models and simulation.  Teams working on complex products and projects such as moving off the planet, must, of necessity, focus their attention primarily and intensively on these entities. In the more profitable entertainment and training simulation industry, the virtual environments focus on the interaction among individuals including avatars. “Talking heads,” facial expressions and body language are critical to many computer games and game environments. A simulation business model focused, instead, on entities, “things”, is not yet a high-volume simulation application. Such simulation comprises a very small and largely academic sector. None of it appears developed for a broad audience. That is unsurprising. Only when the Apollo program demonstrated its capability did the cryogenics industry take off.   People thought airplanes were toys for the rich, and commercial television languished for 20 years. The manufacturer was reluctant to make cordless tools for the Moon seeing no market for them. Simulation that is entity-based may be but another challenge for our imagination.7. ConclusionIt will not get easier. ?Wicked” problems will continue to prove interesting. They demand attention. It is important that each person, in such multi-decadal, massively complex enterprises, has a clear and visible identity and purpose. It is important that “presence” is explicit, (who is here and who is elsewhere). It is important that the work itself and its milestones are visible to all. It is important that help, job aids and guidelines are really helpful. It is important that teams are able to work anywhere and anytime. It is important that their work is safely stored and easily tracked and available. It is really important that the leadership and the system-- sensitive to the pressures and frustrations of unending “wicked” problems and aware that no one ever gets too much applause-- recognize and reward those who slog through these extraordinary difficulties so that the world can, in time, enjoy the results of these endeavors, including the grand adventure of moving off the planet. New “wicked” problems will challenge explorers. With the slightest movement a new pattern emerges. There is no way to forecast accurately. No one can ever say, “everything is finished.” [11]\Endnotes[1]		 Rittel, H.W.J., Webber M.M., 1973, Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning, Policy Sciences 4, Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company, Amsterdam, Netherlands[2]		Lindblom, Charles, 1979, “Still Muddling, Not Yet Through”, ISTOR: Public Administration Review: Vol.39, No.6, Institution for Social and Policy Studies, Yale University, New Haven CT.[3]	 	Driver, E, Jackson, P., 2008, Getting Real Work Done in Virtual Worlds, Forrester, Cambridge, MA. [4]		 Elfrey, P, Risky Business, 2007, NASA White paper, Kennedy Space Center, FL.  [5]		Sterman, J.D., 2004, All Models are Wrong: Reflections on Becoming a systems scientist, Systems Dynamics Review Vol. 18, No 4, John Wiley and Son Ltd, NY[6]		Goleman, D, 1998, Vital Lies, Simple Truths, Bloomsbury Publishing, UK[7] 		CAIB Report, 2003, Volume 1, Part 2, Why the Accident Happened, p.97, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Washington, D.C. [8])		 Einstein, A.
