Unfortunately M&S products tend to get more and more complex, requiring more formal engineering processes, which include formal verification and validation processes.  V&V is the “price” for trustworthy M&S products.To solve this issue the GM-V&V SG’s primary objective will be to provide a path into the creation of an internationally accepted VV&A standard complementing the current VV&A PDG efforts (dedicated to an Overlay of the FEDEP) and in consistency with the VV&A PDG efforts and other existing developments.The final objective is to provide the international community with a methodology that not only embraces a wide variety of M&S products but also may provide a future common basis for the simulation community through the GM-V&V product.High Level Architecture Performance Recommended Practice (HPRP) SG  (SG dissolved due to lack of activity 11 Jun 07)Chair:  Randy Saunders	Johns Hopkins University/APL	rsaunders@ieee.orgVice Chair:  Steve Boswell	BBN Technologies	sboswell@bbn.com	Secretary:  Doug Flournoy	MITRE Corp.	rflourno@mitre.orgThe HLA Performance Recommended Practice (HPRP) SG will conduct an investigation on the best practices for maximizing High Level Architecture (HLA) performance.  The issues associated with performance, and performance optimization, have been discussed in numerous SIW papers without the emergence of a widely shared body of knowledge.  The HPRP SG will examine how these best practices could be collected and made more available to the community.  Among the alternatives are: 1) a SISO balloted Recommended Practice; 2) an interactive web product, probably in the form of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ); 3) an overlay to the FEDEP, analogous to the recently completed V&V overlay.Live, Virtual, Constructive (LVC) Architecture interoperability SGChair:  Len Granowetter	MaK Technologies	lengrano@mak.comVice Chair:  Sam Knight	L-3 Communications	snknight@link.com	Secretary: Michael O’Connor                      ITT                                                     Michael.oconnor@itt.com	Mixed architecture systems are becoming increasingly commonplace, and simulation interoperability is a central issue. The interplay between DIS and HLA simulations is reasonably well understood and TENA is increasingly being bridged into HLA- and DIS-based simulations.  These Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) architecture solutions not only have differing technical solutions, but differing business and standardization models.  This SG will assess the current and future technical and programmatic implications and requirements of the M&S community for LVC architectures and interoperability between them.Message Passing for Simulation-Based Collaborative Engineering Design (MSG-SIM) SGChair:  Zach Crues	NASA 	edwin.z.crues@nasa.govVice Chair:  Danny Thomas	AEgis Technologies	danny.thomas@aegistg.com	Secretary: The Message Passing for Simulation-based Collaborative Engineering Design (Message-Sim) Study Group (SG) was created and sponsored by the SPACE Forum.  Recognizing that HLA, DIS and TENA permit distributed simulation, "the emergence of the Internet and maturation of XML, along with increasing computer capability and solutions to bandwidth issues, raises the possibility of new approaches. These approaches would allow for or be based upon the transfer of rich data sets." "NASA recognizes that message-based communication, as opposed to reliance solely on shared data and synchronous communication, suggests significant opportunities. The question is not an “either HLA or DIS” question. We are asking “how best can we advance message passing in the twenty-first century?” The study may well lead to a “both an HLA and DIS answer” or something else entirely.""This suggests the need to consider how the next wave of simulation technology might address message-based systems, and how they will safely, robustly and flexibly support the full-life span of simulation products. This study will explore serious questions concerning the possibility and requirements of message-based systems in providing needed capability. This may be a new area of research that could lead in a number of directions and hopefully to standards promoting interoperability and accelerated use of modeling and simulation."Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe MODE 5/S IFF SG Chair:  Frank Hill	SDS International Inc.			fhill@sdslink.comVice Chair:  VacancySecretary:  VacancyThe Mode 5/S IFF Study Group (SG) is established to support the DoD/Joint service/NATO simulation community effort to develop the necessary changes to allow live, virtual and constructive simulations incorporate Mode 5 IFF and Mode S (Select) IFF that is currently in use in Europe. The key protocols to review will be DIS, HLA, existing Live Range IFF protocols and TENA as these are the most widely used ones when exchanging exercise truth data.

This problem has many aspects, both pedagogical and technical. A clear first step is to enable SCORM content or Runtime Environments to invoke and communicate with simulations in a standardized and interoperable fashion. Such "SCORM-Simulation Interface Standards" will lower the cost of integration, lead to tools that save designers and developers time and money and help simulation vendors develop reusable simulations and components. This Study Group will be joint between SISO and the IEEE Learning Technology Standards Committee (LTSC).Simulation Conceptual Modeling (SCM) SG Chair:  Jake Borah	AEgis Technologies		jborah@aegistg.comVice Chair:  VacancySecretary:  VacancyThe SCM SG is conducting a preliminary investigation on the use of conceptual modeling in M&S and related information technology domains.

Typically, today's Image Generator (IG) vendors have their own closed, proprietary run-time interfaces.  At I/ITSEC'02, Boeing proposed their Open Source Common Image Generator Interface (CIGI) as a run-time interface that could be adopted by the simulation community.  Boeing indicated that they would like to see a standards organization adopt CIGI and develop it into a robust and broadly accepted simulation industry image generator run-time interface standard.  The SG is discussing this proposal, evaluating alternatives, and generating recommendations and a proposed action plan.Economics of M&S (ECON) SSGChair: Dr. Tim Cooley		       USAF				   tim.cooley@usafa.af.milVice Chair: Pierre Gauvin		       CDN CFEC/SECO		                Pierre.gauvin@drdc-rddc-gc.caSecretary: The original Economics of Simulation Study Group members continue to receive requests for data and analysis results, and decision makers continue to ask for Economics of M&S information.  This Standing Study Group will update the data call, establish terminology and standards, advertise the need for new data, and post findings on a “permanent”, accessible web site.The principal output of the previous Economics of Simulation Study Group included a data call and analysis of the data to that date.  That output has been used to success by SISO members throughout government, industry, and academia.  The University of Central Florida (UCF) in Orlando has used the data gathered for support of its graduate degrees in M&S, and UCF graduate students completed an annotated bibliography of the gathered data as part of their course projects.  Government studies of the Economics of Simulation in Sweden and Australia have requested and used data from the previous study effort.   A NATO M&S Group (NMSG) Task Group NMSG-031 has also used the output from the previous Study Group on the Economics of Simulation, and, in particular, a paper and presentation to the NMSG-031 in late 2005 was based on an updated analysis of the previous Study Group effort.  During the February 2006 M&S Leadership Summit to the Congressional M&S Caucus in Suffolk, Virginia, several times in multiple working groups, the need for definitive data on M&S ROI was requested.  Updated, definitive data and analyses are needed now to advance understanding of the topic and preserve perishable data.Australia Standing Study Group (SISO Australia)Chair:  Craig Pepper (Chair)     	Thales                             craig.pepper@thales-tts.com.au	 Deputy Chair: Michael McGarity	CAE                                 michaelm@cae.com.auSecretary:  Peter Hill 	SIAA                                peter.hill@simcon-services.com.au	 Shane Arnott	Boeing                             shane.d.arnott@boeing.comMark Heffernan	Evans & Peck                   mheffernan@evanspeck.com.auDarren McFarlane	ADSO                              Darren.mcfarlane@defence.gov.au 	 John Morrison	not available                    jbm_au@yahoo.com.au	 Peter Radonyi	Jacobs Australia               peter_radonyi@unwired.com.au	 Peter Ryan	DSTO                              peter.ryan@dsto.defence.gov.au	 Chris Skinner	DisPlay                            cjskinner@acslink.net.auDavid Stratton	Uni of Ballarat                  d.stratton@ballarat.edu.auGrant Tudor	Army                               grant.tudor@defence.gov.auLucien Zalcman	Zalcman Consulting           Lucien_b_zalcman@yahoo.com.auIn May 2006, the Simulation Industry Association of Australia (SIAA) and SISO established the Australia Standing Study Group (SISO Australia) to liase and inform the International Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization in order to meet the needs of the Australian simulation community.

Current Product Development Groups include:Coalition Battle Management Language (C-BML) PDG  Co-Chair:  MAJ Kevin Galvin	DEC(GM)/QinetiQ		Kevin.galvin@btinternet.comCo-Chair:  Andreas Tolk	VMASC/Old Dominion Univ.	atolk@odu.eduVice Chair:  Per Gustavsson	Ericsson	per.m.gustavsson@gmail.comSecretary:  Charles Turnitsa 	VMASC/Old Dominion Univ.	cturnits@odu.edu The development of digitized C2 systems and the opportunity to utilize M&S tools for uses other than training, for example Course of Action Analysis (COAA) and Mission Rehearsal, and work on robotic forces have meant that there is an increased requirement for interoperability across these systems. In addition military operations are no longer conducted by single services and a single national force.  They are likely to be conducted within a coalition or alliance such as NATO. This has led to a requirement for multinational interoperability and the development of standards in support of interoperability, such as the Multinational Interoperability Programme's (MIP) Joint Command, Control and Consultation Information Exchange Data Model (JC3IEDM). In particular, a Battle Management Language (BML) is required that enables expression and communication of military plans and orders across multiple national and coalition forces. It can be seen as a standard representation of a digitized commander's intent to be used for real forces, simulated forces, and for future robotic forces and it must also provide for situational awareness and a shared, common operational picture. A BML is particularly relevant in a network centric environment for enabling mutual understanding.Numerous papers have been published in the SISO C2 and M&S Services/C4I forum track in this area and discussion on this subject has led to the creation of a NATO M&S Coalition Battle Management Language (C-BML) Working Group (MSG 048).  The community is now ready to move forward to develop an appropriate standard based on initial Proof of Principle work in the US, France, Germany and other nations. It is however critical that an international approach be taken to the C-BML development efforts. The same issues that have driven the military forces of other nations to embark on programs of this type will be more cost effective if an internationally recognized standard can be developed. While C-BML focuses on the description of executable tasks and assigning these to military entities, Military Scenario Definition Language (MSDL) targets the initialization of simulation systems with the military scenario. MSDL allows the generation of the military scenario, which consists of the initial state of the military situation and planned actions. Therefore, C-BML and MSDL will be developed as separate Standards but form a close working relationship in their development process. C-BML, as envisioned by this Product Development Group will when developed and applied allow interoperability among coalition C2 systems and simulations. In developing C-BML a phased approach is envisaged. An initial specification based on current doctrines, use of the JC3IEDM and web services will be developed in Phase 1. Subsequent phases will expand to incorporate a tasking and reporting grammar and ontology. Core Manufacturing Simulation Data (CMSD) PDGChair:  Swee Leong	NIST	leong@cme.nist.gov	Vice Chair:  Frank Riddick	NIST	 HYPERLINK "mailto:Riddick@cme.nist.gov" Riddick@cme.nist.govSecretary:  Tina Lee	NIST	leet@cme.nist.govThis product defines a data interface specification for efficient exchange of manufacturing life cycle data in a simulation environment.  The specification provides neutral data interfaces for integrating manufacturing software applications with simulation systems.  The initial effort is focusing on machine shop data definitions.  The plan is to extend the data specification to include supply chain, aerospace assembly operations, automotive vehicle assembly operations, plant layout, and other relevant manufacturing and simulation information.This standard effort is to promote the increased, widespread, and pervasive use of advanced manufacturing technologies, in particular, the simulation technology in the manufacturing industries. The effort will benefit not only the manufacturing industry worldwide, but more specifically it will benefit the Modeling and Simulation community in the near term.Commercial Off-the-Shelf Simulation Package Interoperability (CSPI) PDGChair:  Dr. Simon J E Taylor	Brunel University	simon.taylor@brunel.ac.ukVice Chair:  Steffen Strassburger	Daimler  Chrysler 	Steffen.strassburger@daimlerchrysler.comSecretary:  Stephen Turner	Technological Univ	 HYPERLINK "mailto:assjturner@ntu.edu.sg" assjturner@ntu.edu.sg		   (Singapore)	Since 1980 efforts to improve the productivity of simulation modeling in manufacturing have yielded the range of COTS discrete event simulation packages (CSPs) that are used today by engineers and analysts to investigate complex, dynamic process-based systems found in commerce, health, manufacturing and supply chains.  It is true that there are many different types of system that might be called COTS packages.  However, this work concerns itself with systems that fall under the discrete event simulation paradigm, i.e. simulated models of systems that change state at discrete points in time (scheduled events) or as a result of state changes (conditional events).  These state changes typically represent entities  (documents, patients, parts, trains, etc.) that pass through networks of queues and workstations (work queuing at a desk in an office, patients waiting to see a doctor, parts buffered for machining, trains waiting at a station, etc.)  CSPs support activities such as model building, experimentation, animation, visualization and reporting.  There are currently around 20 of these commercially available.It is important to note that the model/CSP technology is a fixed point.  Virtually every engineering faculty has some course on simulation modeling that uses one or more CSPs.  Engineers and analysts use these CSPs to build and maintain simulation models.  These CSPs therefore represent a significant investment.  Additionally, users of these CSPs are not software engineers – they are simulation modelers.  There is evidence to show that it is highly likely that any major changes to their methodology and technologies will result in the non-adoption of these proposed products.  It is therefore a major consideration of our work that any interoperability products that are developed are highly transparent in nature.Distributed Interoperability Simulation (DIS) PDG Chair:  Bob Murray (eff 27 Mar 07)	The Boeing Co		bob.murray@boeing.comVice Chair Secretary:  Rob Byers	NGC	Robert.byers@ngc.comThe DIS PDG is developing a balloted revision to the IEEE DIS standard 1278.1 and 1278.1a to be designated 1278.1-200X. An incremental approach using a Problem/Change Request (PCR) process along with Tiger teams for specific functional areas are being used to expedite publication of the first revision as there are important changes that need to be made, and balloted on, in the very near term, such as the recommended entity handover changes from the SISO Transfer Control Study Group.  We will review the changes that have already been incorporated as of 31 Aug 05 into Draft 0 of 1278-1-200X at this SIW.

It is intended as a high-level process framework into which lower-level systems engineering practices native to each individual application area can be easily integrated.  The FEDEP is not intended to be prescriptive, but rather defines a generic, common sense development methodology that can and should be tailored to meet the needs of individual user applications.The FEDEP was approved as an IEEE Recommended Practice (IEEE 1516.3) in April 2003.  The IEEE will soon require that the FEDEP be revised, reaffirmed, or withdrawn.  In response to this requirement, the FEDEP PDG will be reestablished and a Kickoff Meeting held at the Spring 2007 SIW.  The agenda of this meeting will include a review of the Product Nomination, the election of officers, and a discussion of the schedule of PDG activities leading up to a successful IEEE ballot.Generic Methodology for VV&A for the Modeling & Simulation Domain (GM V&V) PDGChair   René Jacquart	OWERA-DTIM		jacquart@cert.fr	Vice Chair Secretary 	High Level Architecture (HLA) - Evolved PDG Chair:  Roy Scrudder	DMSO	roy.scrudder@dmso.milVice Chair (US):  Randy Saunders	JHU/APL	r.saunders@ieee.orgVice Chair (European):  Bjorn Moller	Pitch	bjorn.moller@pitch.seSecretary:  Katherine L. Morse	SAIC	Katherine.l.morse@saic.com The IEEE 1516 series of HLA specifications was originally approved by the IEEE Standards Activity (SA) Board in Fall 2000. Since that time, a DoD Interpretations Document for IEEE 1516 and a Dynamic Link Compatible HLA API for IEEE 1516.1 have been in active development. In addition, many new potential HLA requirements have been identified based on feedback from the various domains and application areas that comprise the HLA user community. This PDG seeks to address these requirements via a formal open review of the IEEE 1516 series of specifications. As part of this process, the PDG will incorporate those aspects of the Interpretations Document and Dynamic Link Compatible HLA API that need to become part of the core standard.Link 11 A/B Simulation Standard Network (Link 11 A/B) PDG   Chair:  Joe Sorroche		DMOC/ASRCC	 HYPERLINK "mailto:joe.sorroche@kirtland.af.mil" joe.sorroche@kirtland.af.milVice Chair:  Joe Zehnle		The Boeing Company	Joseph.j.zehnle@boeing.comSecretary:  Rob Byers		Northrop Grumman	Robert.byers@ngc.comThis product will be a SISO standard to define the methods to simulate a Link-11 A/B Network within a Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) or High Level Architecture (HLA) framework.This standard will have two parts, one that will describe extensions to the DIS standard and the second will detail a Base Object Model (BOM) to extend Federate Object Models (FOM) operating in the HLA framework.

As a standard, MSDL is not being developed for simulation alone. The intent is for MSDL to define Military Scenarios that are independent of the application generating or using the scenario. To that end, MSDL is an XML based data interchange format that enables C2 planning applications to exchange the military portions of scenarios with Simulations and other applications.The scope to MSDL is bounded by the situation, defined at one instant in time, combined with the COA about to be taken in context to that situation. The intent is for MSDL to include that information which is either core or common to the situation and course of action of a military scenario.Real-Time Platform Reference FOM (RPR FOM) PDGChair:  Jim Gregg	The Boeing Company		james.w.gregg@boeing.comVice Chair:  VacancySecretary:  Doug Wood	MäK Technologies		dwood@mak.comVersion 1.0 of this Reference Federation Object Model was the first SISO standard, capturing the functionality of IEEE 1278.1-1995.
