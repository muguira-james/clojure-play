We’re suffering from the “convention” feel where the presenters and audience change between papers.  Hopefully we can move to more “workshop” attitudes in future SIWs.  The Forum is still finding it’s definitions.Average attendance 25Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)32Total papers presented6“No-show” presentations0Other presentations and panel discussions0** The Panel discussion with Dr. Davis of his monograph had to be cancelled due to changes in Paul’s schedule.
