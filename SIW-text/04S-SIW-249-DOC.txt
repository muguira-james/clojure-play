Craig Button’s name and email were incorrectly spelled as Burton vice Button.Review of action items. Graham Shanks preparing HLA portion to be done this week. Closed Byers draft invitation to join ballot group, closed edit by Mary Christopher; discussion of 1516 HLA vs 1.3 FOM which Graham is working on; closed Shanks submit radio category/nomenclature changes to DIS EBV doc for para. 4.2.3.7…Joe Sorroche presented a briefing to start the meeting.Update on PDG Current Status; covered goals, history, reference implementation, upcoming events (September standard!?), challenges, on-line resources, DIS 1278.1a is being opened and this DIS-J standard may become part of it.1516 will not be affected by HLA standard, only the RPR FOM.Joe conducted a review of the Draft Standard.  Editorial corrections were made during the meeting.  Besides editorial changes, significant items of interest were:Discussion of levels of fidelity (section 5.2) – as long as HLA time is managed, then one could claim a high level of fidelity.Action item assigned to clear up the byte and bit order of 75 bit words in TJ message: Take the byte ordering of serial bit streams to the DIS extension Study Group – Joe Sorroche will do this. Survey of existing implementations, if clear majority exists, then do it that way. Confirm that existing implementations use little-endian byte ordering (no swapping of serial stream) (treated as an array of words with increasing byte address for increasing bits in stream). Is bit 0 the first or last serial bit? Both actions apply to the TJ message only. Decided to redo Table 5.2.3 with one byte per row vice 4 bytes. This will help eliminate confusion on byte and bit order. Joe will do this.Rob Byer action to add a row to each of tables 5.2.5 through 5.2.12 to clear up the message type association with each.Time Slot ID consists of Time Slot Number, Padding, Epoch Number: the table should be structured (in this row) with the Time Slot ID column split vertically to accommodate the three pieces in the same column width.Section 5.3.1, IEEE 1278.1 – 1995 says PDUs shall be padded to the largest field size within the PDU or 32 bits, whichever is largest. Thus, the tables 5.2.5 through 5.2.12 which contain 64-bit fields must be padded to 64-bit boundary. Decision made to keep the 32-bit boundary padding as in current signal PDU even though one could argue that there is a 64 bit field added as a result of this new standard.Raise a DIS PCR on section 5.3.1 [Bundling Length] regarding padding of PDUs. Graham will do this.Graham actions: What is the modification to the spreadspectrumstruct complex data type in the RPR FOM? Should there be a description in 5.3.7 to talk about adding the JTIDS transmitter struct to the object class in the RPR FOM. The review of the standard was completed at the meeting with action items to be answered.Joe reviewed the newly assigned action items. Moved, seconded, unanimously approved the release of a balloting message upon completion and incorporation of the 5 open action items.Discussed the opening of a new SG for Link-11A or maybe continue the TDL  to study Link-11A and/or IDM or SADL.Meeting was concluded.
