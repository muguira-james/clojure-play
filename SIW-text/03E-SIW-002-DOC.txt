The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control and Communications (C3I) directed that a M&S Master Plan for Information Superiority (IS) be developed, giving full consideration to C4ISR M&S activities throughout the Department.  This is referenced as the IS MSMP.  It identified four specific objectives and a set of actions that support the achievement of the Information Superiority vision.  The next step was to be the development of an Investment Plans that would help to satisfy each of these objectives. One of these objectives dealt with M&S support to the acquisition of C4ISR systems. This paper identifies several initiatives that are being proposed to satisfy this objective.  It is partially based upon a workshop that was organized and conducted in April 2002, specifically sponsored to address this subject.1. IntroductionThis paper describes a recommended Investment Plan for improving M&S support to acquisition and transformation programs. The initiatives described below for meeting this objective also offer the exciting potential for being used to help analyze and track subsets of the Global Infrastructure Grid (GIG) architecture. 2. IS MSMP Background In response to DODD 5000.59, (reference [1], OASD(C3I) has developed a C4ISR Information Superiority Modeling and Simulation Master Plan (reference [2]),. This was published 12 March 2002. It identified four M&S Objectives:Objective 1: Assess the Value of Information SuperiorityObjective 2: Enhance the Integration of M&S with real C4ISR systemsObjective 3: Develop M&S that reflect the decision-making and behavior of Blue and Red Force CommandersObjective 4: Improve M&S support to acquisition and transformationThe next step in this process is to develop an Investment Plan for achieving these objectives. Thispaper deals only with the last of these, Objective 4.To develop this Investment Plan, a workshop was convened on 2 - 4 April 2002 under the sponsorship of OASD (C3I), the Director of Interoperability, Undersecretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics) and the Director Defense M&S Office (DMSO). Forty-four subject matter experts from government, industry, and academia were assembled to address the subject of M&S support to acquisition.  This paper is based upon some of the conclusions and recommendations provided by this workshop. The complete set of these findings can be found in the references [3], [4], and [5].  Extracts as well as interpretations derived from these papers are given in this documentAs illustrated in Figure 1, the workshop noted that the nature of the evolving C4ISR acquisition process is changing. This creates some major challenges requiring adjustment to a new and still evolving national security context and strategy.  The development of the Information Superiority stratagem is partly in response to these changes. The stable evolutionary environment in which requirements are relatively well understood has given way to a period of experimentation and learning necessary to understand how to exploit rapidly emerging technologies and new concepts in order to maintain a competitive advantage over our real and potential adversaries. OldNewWell understood threatNew and uncertain threatsEstablished scenarios/operationsBroad range of missionsDOD focusNational, coalition perspectiveEvolutionary capabilityRevolutionary capabilityForce-on-forceInfo/Effects-based outcomeSystem-on-system advantageSystem-of-Systems advantageRequirements derived from deficiencies Exploration/Learning Figure 1. A New DOD Acquisition ContextSome of the key workshop findings are as follows:Among the major future challenges impacting on C4ISR system acquisition is the need to deal with them in a system-of-systems context.  In the absence of such a system-of-systems context, the tendency is to focus on maximizing system parameters vice mission effectiveness.  For example, one should stress the need for robust communications that support overall force effectiveness in a wide variety of situations rather than attempting to maximize bandwidth allocated to individual systems.The ability to provide a common vision in joint acquisitions has not been very successful.  Even though there have been many efforts to create Integrated Product Teams (IPT) to enhance communications among the functional participants in an acquisition, they have achieved only marginal success.  In part this is due to a failure to share and communally evolve key tools and data.  Also, this is due to differences in institutional cultures contributing to a difference in visions when a single vision is needed for successful system-of-systems developments.There is a need to revisit the policy outlined in the DODD 5000 series, to ensure that system-of-systems issues are adequately addressed.   Moreover, there's a need to develop and provide government/contractor access to authoritative M&S and repositories for data, algorithms, joint scenarios and synthetic natural environments.The need exists for improved "reference models" in the system-of-system context that reflect alternative levels of interest, such as mission or campaign levels and specific areas of M&S application.The need exists for support tools that would include reusable, tailorable scenarios housed in a joint library having an extensive set of scenario "components" to select from (including Blue and Red force lay-downs) and a common set of environmental representations.There is a need for improved time-stamping (synchronization) of past, current, and future system configuration and performance data in assembling coherent system-of-systems representations. Methods to link architectural representations to executable simulations, from the system-of-system perspective, are required, along with the need for common input/output standards and definitions to drive M&S.3. Recommended Initiatives for Objective In order to support the acquisition of C4ISR systems it will be necessary to undertake a balanced set of initiatives requiring actions ranging from matters of policy and recommended management processes through the development of foundation data and other information.  This proposed “Investment Plan” is oriented towards the policy development and management process levels of improvements, keyed to the findings of the workshop. These initiatives, however, should be seen as only initial step in achieving the stated objective of improving support to C4ISR acquisitions. The workshop bottom line was that all C4ISR acquisitions must be conducted in a system-of-systems context.  This will require a strong and an “integrated” (in the sense described in section 3.3 of this paper) M&S capability.  Some of the tools required to do this already exist and can be extended to accommodate this broader perspective.  Notably, one can envision enhancement in and enlargement of the scope of the DOD Architecture Framework (DODAF) so as to better integrate architectures and ensure interoperability in both a functional and an engineering sense.  The current isolated system-based M&S planning process should be enlarged and "integrated" so as to function in both a cross-system and a within-system manner.  There are four recommended initiatives for this proposed Investment Plan. These are the following:Make the Architectural Framework products executable. This is discussed in Section 3.1, where the feasibility of making the DODAF products executable and the associated resource needs for accomplishing this are addressed.Institute a process of Applications Based M&S Planning, where M&S tool development is keyed to specific needs (applications) at an early stage of the acquisition process. This is discussed in Section 3.2.Create an “Integrated M&S Environment”, which ties the above two capabilities into a coherent M&S activity in support of an acquisition program. This is described in Section 3.3.The GIG represents a key common factor in C4ISR system-of-systems architectures. The above three initiatives are directly applicable to the analysis, support and tracking of this GIG architecture.  This leads to a fourth initiative, which is;Apply the preceding three initiatives to the system-of-systems problem, which apply to subsets of the GIG. This is described in Section 3.4, and is addressed in two parts. The first part investigates the scalability of the prior initiatives when applied to multi-system operations. The second part considers application of these techniques to critical functional mission areas. A vision for how each of these will improve the acquisition process and how these can be applied to the GIG will be provided, in terms of the deficiencies/problems they address and how they resolve these. The National Security Agency (NSA), in support of their “Transformation” program, has recently implemented exploratory work on some of these initiatives.  Continuation of these efforts in a broader context should be supported. These are summarized in references [6], and [7]. As will be discussed later, the same is true of the various Services3.1 Executable Architectural FrameworkUnderlying this recommended initiative is the recognition that it is important to formulate and represent C4ISR architectures so as to support reasoning with them in an open fashion, if this is possible. To date, there have been a number of different efforts attempting to take the graphic framework views and extend them to include the data needed to populate different modeling tools and to conduct analysis of different aspects of the architecture.  These approach the problem in unique ways and have had only varying degrees of success.    3.1.1 Background for the First InitiativeThe DoD C4ISR Architecture Framework (DODAF (2.1)) reflects a major ASD (C3I) contribution to the C4ISR acquisition process.  It provides a drill-down multifaceted view of a system's proposed functionality (Operational Views or OVs), its projected implementation (System Views or SVs) and the standards (Technical Views or TVs) that will be employed.  The DODAF has been developed to allow complex C4ISR systems to be viewed in the context of their system-of-systems setting.  It is intended to provide a common language for all "players" and "customers" to communicate with one another at the earliest stages of system development.  As an architectural baseline it identifies common interfaces and potential compatibility issues.A set of required C4ISR DODAF products that have been deemed to be useful in describing the results of the system architecture definition and development process are illustrated in Figure 2. These products are normally developed to support the requirements generation process and should be continued as part of the Concept Development Phase (CDP) of the effected acquisition programs. Specifically, these products convey the following information;OV-1: High Level Operational Concept (illustrating the "big Picture" view of the architecture)OV-2: Operational Node Connectivity Description (showing groupings of functionality and their connectivity)OV-3: Operational Information Exchange Matrix (detailing the information exchanged within the architecture) OV-6c: Operational Event Trace Description (this shows operational architecture functions (threads) in temporal sequences)SV-1: Systems Interface Description (the association of systems with operational nodes and system interfaces)SV-6: Systems Data Exchange Matrix (shows data exchange details between systemsTV-1: Technical Architecture Profile (technical standards adopted by the architecture)It must be noted that the C4ISP requires only this subset of the DODAF products. They have been stated as "mandatory" for purposes of cross-systems interoperability comparisons.  It is unlikely, however, that these will be sufficient to form an executable model as described in this initiative. The above wealth of information provides one with only a partial view of the proposed architecture. The C4ISR DODAF, if sufficiently complete and concordant, if sufficiently instrumented, and if coupled with appropriate input scenarios, could be used to drive a simulation of system data flow and functionality.  The utility of this, in terms of estimating system (or system-of-systems) performance and of placing cost estimates on a firmer analytical footing will be described below.  Its extension to the system-of-systems applications is of great interest and is conceptually feasible, but its practicality hinges on our ability to handle the implied increase in detail and complexity in an effects-based M&S environment, EMBED PowerPoint.Show.8  Figure 2: Required Initial C4ISR DODAF Products 3.1.2 Limitations and ProblemsApart from the obvious benefits of the DODAF, it remains part of an incomplete methodology.  A primary deficiency lies in its lack of what has been termed "concordance" (rules ensuring consistency, completeness and an absence of ambiguity between the different architectural views).  Changes in one of the views are not necessarily represented by changes in other views.  In recent years there have been several DODAF based tools developed that have attempted to address this problem, but with only partial success.  Despite the DODAF's potential to define and aid in the assessment of interactions between systems, its application to systems acquisition (outside of the C4ISP) has characteristically stressed the within-system perspective.  Another deficiency lies in what can be, but is not currently accomplished using the DODAF    Most of the required information to accomplish architectural performance assessments is already provided in the framework products.  However, this is normally not used to provide quantitative representation of the level-of-service performance of the Architecture or serve as a vehicle for validating system costs, interoperability and vulnerability.  This initiative calls for making an executable model based on the DODAF and addressing these deficiencies.One of the key trade-off issues in system acquisitions is the level of detail required to proceed from concept development to actual design and implementation.  The issue revolves around how much effort and cost should be expended prior to the Milestone B decisions regarding selection of alternative architectures and authorization to proceed with system design. 3.1.3 The VisionThe objective of this initiative is to assess the cost-effectiveness of policy changes that would modify the DODAF requirements so as to support creation of a DODAF based executable model.  Apart from testing the concordance of the DODAF products, it would allow for the input of scenario data and be used to derive such performance metrics as latency, throughput, queue sizes, and other such LOS performance evaluations.  Consideration of its application in cross-system assessments is essential.   Application to assessments and problems related to the GIG architecture are potential goals for this initiative.3.1.4 Recommended First InitiativeA study should be commissioned which would review two ACAT initiatives that have provided the requisite DODAF products.  These should serve as a guide to the proposed study.  Using M&S tools selected by the contractor (such as EXTEND, Colored Petri Nets (CPN) and/or others), establish the following:a. Is the information provided by the required DODAF products adequate to support development of an executable model?  If not, what other information should be required?b. The updated DODAF is considering incorporation of standard UML mappings for the DODAF views, opening the door for DOD use of an industry based approach to architecture through the Object Management Group’s (OMG) Model Driven Architecture (MDA) strategy. Should this be the recommended approach? (See reference [8])c. Can this executable model be used to check concordance of the required DODAF products? d. Can this executable model be used to derive Level-of-Service (LOS) metrics, based upon postulated scenario input data and conditions?  Considering the potentially large number of processing and communications threads, is it possible to statistically bound the expected system LOS performance metrics with a reasonable number of stochastic runs?e. Can an executable DODAF be used to help gauge a systems contribution to force effectiveness?f. Can this type of assessment be extended to the system-of-system domain to support interoperability assessments and to assess GIG performance?g. Is it possible to establish cost estimate bounds based on placing confidence bounds on resource estimates for capabilities referenced in the DODAF? h. Assess the advisability of requiring all ACAT-1/2/3 systems to provide an extended executable DODAF model and if this should be done early enough to support Milestone B deliberations.  i. Provide an assessment and recommendations as to the tool of choice based upon generic tool characteristics.Deliverables would be a detailed plan, followed by a demonstration-model (with limited system threads) and recommended changes in ASD (C3I) acquisition policy, at the end of one year.  Estimated costs for this are being developed.3.2 Applications-Based M&S PlanningThe policy guidance offered by the DOD 5000 series has been replaced by “interim guidance” designed to create an acquisition environment that “fosters efficiency, flexibility, creativity, and innovation [9].  This new 5000 series references an “Interim Defense Guidebook” (30 October 2002) where M&S, in the context of planning for Simulation-Based Acquisition (SBA) [10].  The guidance asks Program Managers (PMs) to plan for a “robust and interactive use of M&S throughout the product life-cycle and to plan on making M&S investments early on in support of system design, system Test and Evaluation (T&E), and system modification and upgrade”.  In addition, the revised 5000 series specifically calls out the need for integrated architectures and architectural analyses. The Services have long engaged in planning for making effective use for M&S. in their versions of System Support or M&S Plans.  With the current stress on System-of-System (SOS) and Family-of-Systems (FOS) considerations, these are continuing to improve. These plans, however, do not do the type of early-on planning in support of acquisitions that is called for in this document.3.2.1 Background for the Second InitiativeThe DoD Simulation Based Acquisition (SBA) initiative recognizes that careful thought should be given to M&S application in support of major system acquisitions.  This is supported throughout the policy described in the interim DODD 5000 series. M&S is recognized as a valuable tool for assessments dealing with mitigation of risk, performance projections, and its support to a large number of acquisition and operational decisions.  However, not all problems should be resolved using M&S tools.  The advantages of pre-thinking the appropriateness of M&S over the course of the acquisition, development, operations and sustainment of a program are manifest and recognized. A system's operation in the system-of-systems context has also been noted to be of key concern.  It can be argued that some of the M&S developments are for "single-issue applications" (such as a specific design trade-off) and that a coherent methodology for evolving M&S plans is not always followed.  Because of the expense of developing large-scale M&S tools, the available COTS and GOTS capabilities are often drivers of what M&S tools are applied.  While this may be appropriate in many cases, it would appear more reasonable to start with the "needs" and "applications" requiring M&S tools and to build an M&S plan based upon this type of rationale.  This addresses both modifying existing models to meet these needs as well as designing new models. However, all the models identified or projected should meet the DOD requirements to be interoperable in a federation.. 3.2.2 Limitations and ProblemsIt was noted in the IS MSMP that M&S is widely used in each phase of the acquisition process, as well as throughout the future development and operation of systems. The findings that were published in this IS MSMP included the following;	"There are many people involved in developing and using M&S tools to support their assigned responsibilities.""Frequently, many of the models and simulations are developed as by-products of recognized project activities and are neither documented nor widely shared among the various members of the project team."  In this context, they are also often populated with un-validated data or data applicable to a very restricted scenario."The various outputs derived from using these M&S tools feed many customers, who use these outputs despite the possibilities that they may or may not have been derived from consistent data sources or under a common set of modeling assumptions." The IS MSMP goes further in asserting that “on the face of things, there are ample reasons for concern over duplication and a recognized need to make sure that M&S activities are integrated over development and life-cycle planning efforts.  Acquisition experts will agree that this remains a problem."The intent of this initiative is to assess whether the concept of Application Based M&S (ABMS) planning, as described below in Section 3.2.3, should be promulgated for C4ISR system developments.   This has further implications regarding the initiative recommended in Section 3.3, dealing with the needs for an "Integrated M&S Environment" for many C4ISR system transformations and developments.3.2.3 The VisionThe methodology proposed for ABMS planning is fairly simple and can be represented as a three-step procedure.a.  Identify and detail those decisions, problems, and issues where M&S could provide support and the approximate dates when these must be accomplished.  This should include, but not be limited to the following classes of applications; Early prediction of level of service parameters (latency, spill-over, throughput, responsiveness, etc.)Resource evaluations keyed to various projected environments and alternative modes of operation and at acceptable levels of service constraints.Studies related to the impact of changes in the target environmentStudies dealing with contribution to force effectiveness where the acquired system is only one of the essential components.Performance monitoring and predictions under various contingency conditionsSituation reconstruction for analysisPerformance of a wide range of T&E activities (to include interoperability assessments) involving synthetic and/or live or recorded environmental/target data and between synthetic or real internal and/or external subsystems Support of transition studies wherein new capabilities are interfaced with new or legacy capabilities in anticipated threat environments.Provide a platform for training, experimentation, and performing man-in-the-loop assessmentsProvide a test-bed for supporting selected trade studiesProvide the basis for rationalizing changes in requirements and specificationsThe first step is to extend and try to complete this list.The specific decisions, problems, and issues in the above categories carry with them a time when these must be resolved.  Thus, the needs are time-ordered.b. Describe the M&S capabilities required and potential alternatives to using M&S based upon specific representative decision needs, issues, and problems identified. For each case, provide a recommended approach (M&S, alternative, or hybrid) and a cost-effectiveness rationale for this recommendation.c. Eliminate all but those decisions, problems and issues where M&S capabilities are recommended, develop a time-sequenced set of needed M&S capabilities for inclusion in the ABMS plan.  Given that the program will need these M&S capabilities, a second review of problems, and issues that could have been resolved using alternative means should be reconsidered in light of having such an M&S capability.3.2.4 The Recommended Second InitiativeA study of  selected C4ISR acquisitions should be conducted to test the above-described methodology.  One of these acquisitions should be for a relatively mature program and perhaps a second study should be for a program at an early phase of acquisition.  The outputs required should include the following; a. A list of specific problems, issues, decisions where M&S represents possible and reasonable approaches. b. Reasons for including or excluding any of the above referenced approaches from the set that is recommended for M&S resolution.c. A matrix of time-ordered capabilities required, along with rough cost estimates for the procurement and/or development of such capabilities, either as additions to existing models or as components of projected ones.d. An overall assessment of this methodology with reasoned recommendation regarding its feasibility, practicality, and its deficiencies in regard to single system acquisitions.e. Same as item d but done in the context of system-of-systems applications, andf. Recommendations for potential C4ISR policy changes that would provide measurable benefits to DoD Estimates for the cost of this initiative are under development3.3 Integrated M&S Environments (IMSE)As noted in Section 3.2, the interim 5000 series policy documents make reference to integrated architectures and integrated architectural analysis.  While no reference is made to integrated M&S capabilities, each of the Services are constructing such capabilities in support of their transformation efforts. The tools that support federation of M&S capabilities recognize the need to integrate M&S in those environments where M&S tools are considered intellectual properties and where expertise is spread over many of the contractors, Services and Government Agencies.   3.3.1.  Background for the Third InitiativeThe workshop paper (summarized in references [4] and [5]) noted that many approaches are being pursued to use M&S to support acquisition.The Navy is developing a Naval Collaborative Engineering Environment (NCEE) to support the Service's integration and interoperability requirements.  The USAF Electronic Systems Command (ESC) is developing a Joint Synthetic Battlespace (JSB) to support the future acquisition and integration of C4ISR-weapon system-of-systems.  The Army is also creating an arena to evaluate concepts based on capabilities developed at the Joint Precision Strike Demonstration (JPSD) and the Joint Virtual Battlespace (JVB), that integrates M&S tools and resources from a variety of sources. In the Army’s Future Combat System (FCS) transformation efforts, the Advanced Collaborative Environment (ACE) component serves to perform these M&S integration activities. These are only some of the efforts underway to efficiently employ M&S in the system acquisition and development processes.The need for an M&S environment to support acquisition is also recognized at the OSD level. Based on the Navy’s Distributed Engineering Plant (DEP) program, used as a vehicle to ensure that mixes of assembled systems are mutually supportive and interoperable, the concept of a broadened Joint DEP (JDEP) evolved. The Integrated M&S Environment (IMSE) discussed here attempts to meld all of these ideas into a concepts that is appropriate to both individual acquisition programs or groups of acquisition programs in order to accomplish a broader range of program objectives, as detailed below. 3.3.2. Limitations and ProblemsThe limitations and deficiencies derive directly from the factors discussed in Section 3.2.2, and reflect the findings of the underlying IS MSMP. 3.3.3. The VisionIn essence, the IMSE will serve to provide both an analysis and a "plug-and-play" capability central, providing coordination of distributed efforts and involving mixtures of real and synthetic components flexibly configured to satisfy a wide range of applications similar to those identified in Section 3.2.3.  Its operation will potentially extend to the systems-of-system interfaces it communicates with or supports.  The hosted simulations must be High Level Architecture (HLA) compatible and will use the Run Time Interface (RTI) for interfacing real and synthetic components of the system.  When used in direct support of operations, it must be consistent with the Defense Information Infrastructure Common Operating Environment (DII COE) standards and protocols.The term integrated, as used in the IMSE, does not necessarily imply that it would be resident at a single location or operated under the direction of a single organization.  Thus, there are no intrinsic conflicts between this IMSE concept and the approaches being followed by the Services.  It does imply that the application of M&S support to the procurement, development and operation of M&S capabilities be conducted from a common program perspective, by virtue of a defined process.  This process would allocate the use of its resources to support the program needs, to include:a. The acquisition process (to include T&E).b. Day-to-day operation of the specific C4ISR system (to include its functional role with the system-of systems it operates with)c. Analysis efforts associated with the acquired system (contingencies, risk assessments, system robustness, architectural gaps, etc.), d. Training.e.  Integration, andf. Experimentation (to include Human-in-the Loop (H/L) and Software-in- the-Loop (S/L)) considerations.                3.3.4. The Third InitiativeThis IMSE initiative is viewed as an add-on to that described in Section 3.2.4, dealing with ABMS planning.  It represents an extension of this concept, which would estimate the relative savings, cost-avoidance and other benefits accrued from ABMS planning and an "Integrated" approach to M&S. This initiative would reference other studies that have assessed the value of M&S and provide coherent arguments justifying these findings.  As with the previous initiatives, estimated costs for accomplishing this are not yet available.Application to the GIG.The Global Infrastructure Grid (GIG) is so large and complex that it defies analysis of its composite performance. It is critical, however, that analysis of smaller segments of the GIG be analyzed to extend our assessments to the future SOS and FOS environments.  3.4.1. BackgroundAs stated in internal ASD (C3I) correspondence (by several senior ASD personnel), the need exists for a model that could assess the ability of programmed GIG system architectures to meet the demands for information support that will be levied upon it at various points in the future.  This need was never satisfied, despite frequent references to such problems and concerns.3 .4.2	Limitations and ProblemsA briefing provided to the Secretary of Defense by ASD(C3I) on 9 September 2002 asks the big question, “What should the relative emphasis between re-capitalizing legacy forces to meet near-termchallenges and to transform C4ISR capabilities?  It goes on to ask the specific questions; a.  How should we address shortfalls in C2 linkages between strategic, operational and tactical echelons?b. How should we balance core collection and exploitation capabilities versus longer-term intelligence collecting capabilities?c. How should we balance the current C4ISR architecture and future transformational architectures?While competent experts are struggling with these issues from a broad perspective, the methodology does not exist to provide quantitative support to analysis of these issues. Questions about tools needed to address limitations in the C4ISR infrastructure were raised in the Workshop (reference [3]), pointing out that programs draw on infrastructure requirements without regard to how the infrastructure is built, improved or funded. It noted the poor record for projecting future bandwidth requirements and opined that this may derive from an inability to ascertain such information from C4ISPs, despite the fact that this is a required content for this document.  The VisionThe GIG represents a major Information Superiority enabler and therefore is of critical concern to ASD (C3I).  Application of the capabilities offered by the preceding three initiatives to the GIG, would provide the Department with the ability to do the analysis to help determine the adequacy of the GIG and to assess progress toward achieving its intended goals.  The potential benefits described for the preceding initiatives apply to this initiative, as well.  The vision, therefore, consists of an IMSE for subsets of the GIG (corresponding to what’s been referred to as Mission Capability Packages (MCPs)), housing executable and interlacing DODAF representations of its constituent components as one of its capabilities.  As used by the US Navy [11] the term MCP is used to represent a task-oriented bundle of Processes with associated CONOPS and organizational structuresSystems to include networks, sensors, weapons and IT systemsPeople and supporting services sustaining these processes and systems.These are not treated as a collection of things and processes but as a single system.  It is in this sense that the term is used here, where the component systems are joint, Service and intelligence Agency assets.The Recommended InitiativeThe difficulty (vice complexity) of this undertaking lies in its size and magnitude.  This leaves the issue of feasibility; based upon scalability and cost factors, open.  It is expected that progress in the initiatives described in 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 would provide adequate information to start constructing a MNS and a preliminary concept for the GIG or MCP parts of the GIG IMSE.  The first phase of this fourth initiative will yield descriptions of the constituent GIG subset components and their interfaces, status of their individual DODAF representations (completeness as well as any compatibility issues), effort required to enhance these to the point where they would be individually and collectively executable.  It would then scope-out the ABMS needs for an IMSE, options regarding its configuration and CONOPS, and ultimately develop a detailed MNS for Government approval. The second phase of this initiative would be that of planning and implementing this initiative   4.0 ReferencesDoD Directive 5000.59-P, DoD Modeling and Simulation (M&S) Master Plan, October 1995ASD(C3I): C4ISR Information Superiority Modeling and Simulation Master Plan (IS MSMP), March 21, 2002.Workshop Sponsored by OASD(C3I), Director of Interoperability (USD/AT&L), and the Director DMSO: M&s Support to Acquisition, 2-4 April 2002, Workshop Summaries,J.Dahmann, Z.
