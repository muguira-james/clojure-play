The really important contributions of papers in this vein were related to keeping computational demand and data bandwidth to a minimum while improving fidelity and realism.  Example papers were the integration of weather models in constructive simulation (07S-SIW-038) and the addition of medical assessments into OneTESS (07S-SIW-069).  Additionally, there was a paper on research in collaboration and its importance and impact on the design and development of mission planning and after action review systems and tools (07S-SIW-095).  Although there continues to be an expanding stovepiped community for mission planning and after action review, this paper described a research driven approach to conducting systematic evaluations of alternative approaches to mission planning and after action review that focus on the team and its cohesiveness and integration into the processes and on actual quality of the plan, execution, outcomes and review; finally connecting to actual measures of mission effectiveness.  There was a great discussion at the end of this paper related to how the research that was presented could be used to drive down the number of stovepipes while increasing the quality and availability of data packaged in a format to advance learning.Human Performance Measurement:  Papers were presented that related to enhancements/additional data in DIS to support human performance measurement and modeling leading towards the improvement of training and effectiveness assessment.  There was a very good discussion at the end of the DIS paper (07S-SIW-067) related to the issues the author had raised in the presentation.  There was substantial interest in the work AFRL/HEA has been doing to identify and specify the character of the data that needs to be present irrespective of the data source (operational system, simulation, range, etc.).  The discussion and interest were driven by a desire to have the author bring his issues to appropriate SISO forums to ensure that the issues get a fair hearing and support as recommendations for fielded simulation systems and network data architectures.Gaming and Training:  The issues raised in one of the papers (07S-SIW-029) have yet to be addressed on any kind of scale with respect to training systems in general, much less gaming environments for training.  The paper points to the real shortfalls we still see in operational training rehearsal and exercise events.  The paper focused on gaming technologies supporting time critical targeting decision making training.  The approach and the mind set of the developers was creative and very forward thinking in terms of its leverage of the fidelity opportunities afforded to training by gaming and by the need to develop rapidly prototyped content for deployment readiness decision making training and rehearsal.M&S and Learning Disciplines:  Two papers discussed issues surrounding the use of modeling and simulation within education, the first within liberal arts and the second within the social sciences.  The first paper (07S-SIW-007) discussed how modeling and simulation has begun to make inroads into those areas of liberal arts that are quantifiable, such as economics and political science, as well as areas that are less amenable to quantification, such as history and religion.  The paper described the necessity of  developing a common body of knowledge and common standards for M&S so that common ground can be established among educators and simulationists.  The second paper (07S-SIW-046) described how modeling and simulation is used throughout engineering and has a growing use in social sciences as well; but that the two are rarely integrated.  The presentation pointed out that systems built by engineers are used by humans and therefore must incorporate the effects of humans on the physical systems.  Suggested solutions included more integration of social sciences, integration of modeling and simulation across social sciences, more formalized modeling, and having M&S as a discipline.The TRAIN Forum continues to receive numerous papers that address our Call for Papers topics.  For future SIW events, the Training Forum intends to solicit papers that address key issues and lessons learned from gaming applications to training; as well as training issues and advances in developing content for training decision making at various levels of military operations.  Additionally, we intend to resurrect our panel presentation format in future SIW events discussing topics such as serious games, PC sims, and bridging the philosophical divide between M&S and training professionals.  Finally, the TRAIN Forum is pleased to welcome Dr Anya Andrews from Novonics Corp. as an appointed member to the Planning and Review Panel (PRP).  Her interests within e-learning, simulation-based training, and gaming technology complement the existing areas of expertise maintained by our current TRAIN Forum PRP membership.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)24Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)40Peak attendance (joint session with IO-ISR)26Total papers presented12“No-show” presentations1Other presentations and panel discussions0Recommended Reading List nomination: 07S-SIW-067:  DIS: Does Interoperability Suffice?
