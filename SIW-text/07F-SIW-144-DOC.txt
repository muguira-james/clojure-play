Name of Forum or Group:  CMSD PDGChairSwee LeongVice ChairFrank RiddickSecretaryTina LeeObjectives for this Workshop:To provide a progress report on the CMSD PDG activity.To provide a brief overview of the released draft document.To provide a briefing on the investigation and evaluation of other standards data activities related to CMSD effort.To provide a briefing on SISO product ballot processes, policies, and procedures.Comments and Recommendations:Provided a progress report on the CMSD PDG activity.Made a presentation of the investigation and evaluation results of the other standards data efforts, e.g. ISA-95, OAGIS, UGS Simulation Data Exchange (SDX), and OPC.Made a presentation titled, “A Pilot Implementation of the Core Manufacturing Simulation Data Information Model” at the 2007 Fall SIW.Received briefings from Peggy Gravitz, CMSD PDG TAD, and Mark McCall, CC Chair on SISO product ballot processes, policies, and procedures.Completed a collaboration project with Volvo Cars Corporation and Chalmers University of Sweden to input manufacturing resource data to Enterprise Dynamic simulation model via an XML document based on the CMSD specification.  The Enterprise Dynamic simulation software is used to model the Volvo car body paint assembly process.Completed a collaboration project with Geer Mountain Software to extend the distribution functions such that the specification would accommodate and be able to support various commercial simulation software on the market.Next step: 1. to extend the CMSD specification to include plant layout information. The plant layout specification will be based on Simulation Data Exchange (SDX) specification from UGS Software.to collaborate with Volvo Trucks and Chalmers University to test the CMSD specification with Plant Simulation software from UGS. The objective of the project is to exchange manufacturing data between production databases and Plant Simulation software according to the data structures of the CMSD specification. The UGS’s Plant Simulation software is used to model the Volvo truck engine manufacturing assembly operations.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)6Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)6Peak attendance (including joint sessions)6Total papers presented“No-show” presentationsOther presentations and panel discussionsRecommended Reading List nomination:                  2007 FALL SIW OUTBRIEF FORM
