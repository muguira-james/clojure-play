Most large organizations have developed and maintain sophisticated models of various aspects of their operations (e.g., manufacturing, transportation, distribution, financial, information technology).  Increasingly, these organizations need to link their process models with those of their suppliers, customers, shippers, subsidiaries,  and partners to insure orderly and efficient operations.  To achieve these goals, organizations need to link together heterogeneous sets of models built with multiple suites of modeling tools and databases -- few of which were designed with any thought of interoperability.  Data interchange formats and other standards could greatly facilitate this process, and represent an opportunity for potential SISO products.Plenary session speakers will include members of industry, government, and academia who are leading efforts to integrate process models into a system of systems`` to enhance logistics and other critical operations.  Workshop sessions will address simulation, infrastructure, procedural, validation, and economic implications of these efforts.INDIVIDUAL FORUM AND GROUP CALLS FOR PAPERSGenerally, papers and presentations are considered in three main categories:  *  User Community Forums, which examine and promote topics of     interest related to the use and adequacy of available     simulation capabilities and new capabilities needed by     M&S users.  *  Specialty Area Forums, which examine and promote current and     emerging simulation processes and technology.  *  Virtual Forums, Study Groups, Product Development Groups, and     Special Sessions, which deal with topics that merit timely     solicitation of feedback from the SISO community.Short synopses of the individual Forum and group Calls for Papers areprovided below.  Additional details are provided in the web version ofthe CFP located at  HYPERLINK "http://www.sisostds.org/siw/02Spring/index.htm." \o "http://www.sisostds.org/siw/02Spring/index.htm." \t "_new" http://www.sisostds.org/siw/02Spring/index.htm.USER COMMUNITY FORUMSAnalysis (ANL)ANL focuses on interoperability issues and uses of distributed modelsand simulations by the analysis community, including issues of experiment design and data analysis, analysis issues in ADS and SBA,requirements definition.
