RD&E ForumChairRalph WeberVice ChairBret Givens (Cynthia Ballard – Acting)SecretaryMark McCallObjectives for this Workshop:Tighten focus on needs of the RDE community for Distributed Simulation.Conduct a panel discussion on M&S for Space users.Have at least one invited presentation from a non-traditional M&S user.Comments and Recommendations:Had to bring in more chairs for SIW-024 (first presentation during joint session w/ T&E), which was a nice problem to solve!  Kudos to the Holiday Inn staff for reacting quickly to our needs.Developing RTI benchmark performance test standards was a High-Interest Item (HII), based on the attendance during and questions after SIW-024.  Ralph Weber offered up the RDE e-mail reflector as a method for interested parties to provide feedback to Ray Drake (who presented SIW-024).RDE (and by extension all User Fora) were originally set up to provide user requirements to the SISO community.  This input was to be addressed by the appropriate SA Forum or the CC or SAC.  There is currently no mechanism to ensure that user issues are addressed.  Recommend the CC establish a process to ensure that user issues are addressed by the appropriate SA Forum.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)36Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)41Peak attendance (including joint sessions)80Total papers presented7“No-show” presentations0Other presentations and panel discussions1 – Panel Dscussion,1 – Invited PresentationRecommended Reading List nominations (including previous nominations):03F-SIW-02403F-SIW-029
