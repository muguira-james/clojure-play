The DIS SG has met the requirements of the TOR.2.  We determined that there is a significant community interested in improving the DIS standard.  We have conducted bi-weekly teleconferences since the Fall 03 SIW.  Participants have submitted more than 100 PCR forms.  These are available in the DIS SG document library on the SISO web site.3.  The Study group received presentations from implementers of proposed changes to Entity State, C4I, BDA and Live Entity PDU structures.4.  By acclimation, the Study Group agreed to cease operations and reconstitute as a Product Development Group as soon as SAC approval is achieved.  We are assured that this will occur whenever they can get a quorum together.5.  The DIS SG then conducted a “Not a PDG Kickoff Meeting”.  We covered the BDPD requirements and Drafting Group constitution.  We will have an official kickoff meeting via the web and teleconference as soon as the SAC acts.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)31Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)35Peak attendance (including joint sessions)N/ATotal papers presented4“No-show” presentations0Other presentations and panel discussions1 – Not a Kickoff MeetingRecommended Reading List nominations (including previous nominations):N/A
