INTRODUCTION1.1   BackgroundCaptive flight testing of sensors and seekers has been supported at Redstone Arsenal since the 1970s.  Airborne test of sensors and seekers required that the sensor be mounted in a stabilized gimbal if sensor performance was to be evaluated.  This precluded the test of many prototype or commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) sensors, or required the development of expensive custom gimbals to carry the sensors.   In 1996, the Redstone Technical Test Center (RTTC) began development of an airborne sensor test bed to facilitate the test of prototype, COTS, or multiple sensor configurations.  This system, the Stabilized Electro-optical Airborne Instrumentation Platform (SEAIP), has been successfully used in the support of sensor/seeker development for missiles, UAVs, airborne surveillance systems, and to support data collection for modeling and simulation.  An additional unit was procured in 2002 to handle increasing workloads.  Design considerations included large payload size, ease of sensor integration, payload stabilization, target tracking/pointing, sensor cooling, and forward compatibility for future improvements.  Use of the system revealed a need for additional improvements which have proven to be beneficial; GPS tracking, computer interface improvements, data link, and control interface upgrades.  Further improvements are planned which will include remote ground control of the gimbal, inertial line-of-sight (LOS) slaving, and improved video tracking capability.2.  AIRBORNE SENSOR TEST CONSIDERATIONS 2.1   GeneralThe airborne test of sensors and seekers offers many advantages to the tester.  The sensor may be tested in its design environment, with range, aspect angle, and atmospheric attenuation values being identical to those expected during future operations.  The sensor may be carried to virtually any area for test, including urban areas.  This is a particular advantage in the case of UAV sensors, which can not be readily tested (if at all) over urban areas/cities.Airborne sensor test offers unique challenges for the tester.  The SEAIP is carried by a rotary wing aircraft.  This aircraft provides the required versatility for flight profiles, but creates a relatively high vibration level which would degrade the performance of any un-stabilized sensors.  Optimum sensor performance requires that the sensor’s line-of-sight (LOS) be stabilized, typically to within 20-25% of the instantaneous field of view (IFOV) (the field of view of one pixel) of the sensor under test.  It is common to use additional sensors to provide comparative, or truth data during test.  Any of these sensors may be required for gimbal steering/tracking.  These sensors must be boresighted to the sensor(s) under test if all sensors are to be pointed at the test area or target.  Acquisition of targets with airborne sensors can be difficult due to small sensor field-of-view (FOV), atmospheric attenuation, and lack of situational awareness.  Wide FOV sensors work well for determining the sensor orientation with respect to the ground, but make small targets difficult to see, and unfamiliarity with a test area will present additional challenges to the operator.  Pilots must be able to accurately position the aircraft relative to the target if useful comparison is to be made of data collected during multiple test runs.  A reliable method for sensor pointing and aircraft positioning must be used if these challenges are to be overcome.  Careful flight scenario planning, pilot and crew briefing, and use of support instrumentation are used to ensure successful data collections.3.  SYSTEM DESCRIPTION3.1   GeneralThe SEAIP consists of a 30 inch diameter gimbal system and an aircraft-borne instrumentation rack.  The gimbal is 2-axis system; each axis consists of 2 nested gimbals, one for coarse stabilization, and one for fine stabilization.  The inner gimbal plate has been designed to be removable to facilitate payload installation and ease of reconfiguration.  Alternate gimbal plates may be installed as necessary to accommodate integration of larger sensors.  The outer skins are fabricated as needed to support different sensor geometries.  Control electronics include a dual gate video tracker, GPS tracking, a serial computer control interface, and manual joystick control.  A high-pressure cryogenic supply is included to support open-cycle cooled sensors.  The gimbal may be mounted vertically or horizontally, depending on test and sensor requirements.  This permits proper gimbal steering with respect to the gimbal nadir versus test scenario requirements.  Currently, the SEAIP is carried by a modified UH-1H aircraft.  A photograph of the SEAIP mounted on the aircraft is shown in Figure 1.                              Figure 1.   SEAIP on UH-13.2   SEAIP Performance CharacteristicsThe SEAIP gimbal is stabilized to within 35 μradian RMS of an inertial line-of-sight (LOS).  Stabilization may vary between configurations, with higher mass/inertia sensor configurations resulting in a higher degree of stabilization.  Careful attention must be given to the sensor cabling, as it can affect stabilization through the introduction of disturbance to the inner gimbals.  Aerodynamic forces on sensors that extend through the gimbal skins will also have an effect on stabilization.  Performance characteristics are shown in Table 1.	3.3   Gimbal Mechanical DesignThe mechanical portion of the SEAIP turret assembly consists of a four-axis gimbal assembly (2 azimuth, and 2 elevation).  The gimbal assembly provides stabilization to both the azimuth and elevation axes through nested coarse and fine azimuth and elevation gimbals.  Steering commands are sent to the fine axes.  As the fine axes move, the coarse axes are commanded to follow them.  Higher bandwidth stabilization is handled by the fine axes, while the coarse axes handle lower bandwidth vibrations and provide the angular range of motion to the gimbals.  Aerodynamic forces act on the outer coarse gimbals, which serve to isolate the inner gimbals and payload from these disturbances.  Sensor mounting is provided by means of an optical bench which serves as the innermost gimbal assembly.  The optical bench/inner gimbal has tapped holes arranged in a grid network, spaced three inches apart from each other along both sides of the bench assembly.  Sensors may be mounted at any location on the bench, which is also used to support any necessary ballast or electronics boxes.  The bench assembly may be relocated from the centerline of theAngular stabilization35 radian RMS nominalPayload80 lbs on gimbal, 4.5 ft3Gimbal range130 degrees az, +90 to –110 degrees el, reversibleTrackerGPS, centroid and correlation videoEnvironmental-40oC to +70 oC, 100% relative humidityAcceleration6 g steady stateTable 1.

The unpopulated turret assembly is shown in Figure 2.  The forward and aft turret skins are fabricated from carbon fiber, and are easily removable using two captive latches mounted in the gimbal that engage slotted bolts that are attached to the skins.  This permits quick access to the interior of the gimbal assembly and payload.  Turret skins are fitted with windows specific to each sensor installation. Figure 2.  Turret assembly with skins removed showing unpopulated optical bench, inner and outer gimbal assembliesThe SEAIP gimbal assembly may be mounted on the aircraft in two different configurations, either vertically or horizontally, as shown in Figure 3.   The configuration selected depends on the desired sensor pointing angle relative to the aircraft.  Steep aspect angles require that the gimbal be mounted horizontally, as shown in Figure 2.  If shallow aspect angles perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the aircraft are required the gimbal must be mounted vertically.  This is required to avoid steering the gimbal into its nadir, or singularity.  Since the gimbal has only 2 axes of motion, steering into the nadir will result in the loss of control authority about one of the desired axes.  The gimbal is mounted to a standard rear armament mount, located on the right side of the helicopter.  An additional interface mount is used if the gimbal is to be mounted vertically.  Electrical power for the SEAIP is provided by a 3-phase 2.4 KVA inverter, which mounts on the left rear armament mount.  This location provides counterbalance to the gimbal assembly, and provides additional space inside the aircraft for support instrumentation.      Data collection instrumentation, sensor electronics, and computer control systems are mounted in the helicopter in a 19 inch 3-bay instrumentation rack.  The rack is designed to satisfy airworthiness requirements, and to maximize the use of available space on board the aircraft.  The rack is mounted behind the pilots; the operators sit behind it, facing forward.  The SEAIP control electronics consist of control and power distribution chassis, video recorders, and at least one video monitor.  Frequently a rack mounted computer and IMU system are included, depending on specific test requirements.  Typically at least 2 bays are left free in the rack for sensor support instrumentation.Figure 3.  UH-1 aircraft showing different mounting configurations for the SEAIP gimbal3.4   SEAIP Control SystemsThe SEAIP is designed to take gimbal steering inputs from various sources.  Manual control is accomplished through the use of an analog joystick, which is used to manually drive the gimbal to point to the desired location.  This method allows the operator to manually track targets or bring targets into the sensor FOV for the video tracker.  A target may be tracked using either centroid or correlation tracking algorithms on any one of eight available video inputs.  The SEAIP will also track targets with a GPS tracker.  Manual corrections to gimbal steering may be made during video or GPS track via the joystick.  Alternate control of SEAIP functional modes may be accessed through a serial computer control interface.  The gimbal will also slave to other gimbals co-located on the aircraft, or seekers mounted within the SEAIP gimbal.  Use of a serial data radio and video downlink will allow remote operation of the SEAIP system.                                                                  3.5   Video and Data Downlink Currently the SEAIP is supported with a two channel video/data downlink.  National Television Standards Committee (NTSC) video and data signals are compressed and multiplexed into a data stream using a video compression system.  The processed signal is then sent to an RF transmitter.  A blade antenna is used for signal transmission from the aircraft.  A directional horn antenna is used on the ground for signal reception, as it has a higher directional gain.  This requires tracking of the aircraft which may be accomplished either manually, or with a tracking antenna.  Once received on the ground, the signal is routed through a bit synchronizer to an expansion unit.  Video and data is then available for use.  The current data link operates in the S band.  Figure 4 shows a diagram of the video/data downlink system. EMBED Visio.Drawing.6                      Figure 4. Video/data downlink RTTC has an effort underway to implement ground remote control of the SEAIP, with initial operational capability by the end of FY05.  This will require the addition of a data uplink, which will be required to send commands to the SEAIP gimbal.  A data downlink will be required to provide feedback to the ground operator, and to display SEAIP operational status.  A minimum of 2 video signals will be transmitted to the ground for system control, recording, or other use.  The airborne SEAIP control panel will be replicated to provide the ground operator with full system operational capability.  An auto-tracking ground antenna will be utilized to extend operational range.   The remote ground control capability will increase the utility of the SEAIP as a UAV surrogate.  In addition, the elimination of the SEAIP operator from on board the aircraft will provide a performance improvement for the aircraft, as some installations become heavy enough to require a reduction in mission flight time.tc "3.5	GPS Tracking and Reflective Memory"3.6   GPS Tracking and Reflective Memorytc "3.5	GPS Tracking and Reflective Memory"GPS tracking has been developed for the SEAIP to satisfy the need to acquire and track non-visible or obscured targets, such as chemical or biological simulants, or camouflaged targets.  GPS tracking requires accurate measurement of position and orientation of the gimbal in inertial space while the aircraft is in flight.   An integrated GPS IMU system is used to determine the aircraft location and orientation.  Aircraft orientation is summed with SEAIP/aircraft gimbal angles to determine gimbal orientation in space.  This information, coupled with GPS coordinate information of the desired target, is used by the SEAIP processor to generate steering inputs to the gimbal for target tracking.  Generation of GPS coordinates for targets is done though a program running on a computer mounted in the aircraft instrumentation rack.  This target tracking program allows the operator to enter GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude), altitudes, and user defined names into a database.  Once these are entered and selected, the tracking program outputs a properly formatted string to the SEAIP processor.  The selection of the target locations can be changed during flight.  After a target location has been selected and output for tracking, its coordinates may be incremented or decremented through the user interface.  The GPS target tracking program is also used to permit scanning of target areas.  Target area scanning is accomplished by changing GPS coordinates with respect to time to effect a scan of the area of interest.  The scanning function generates scan points around a given coordinate in a rectangular pattern.  The capability to enter a scan dwell time, a forward or reverse scan, and a manual scan has also been implemented.  Use of this function allows a sensor to search a predetermined area, and when combined with the moving map function (section 3.6) permits sensor mapping of target detections on a digitized map or photograph of the test area.  Subsequent developments have included the capability to perform a predictive track based on ballistic trajectory data generated by a simulation running on the target tracking computer.    Installation of a GPS receiver and an RF modem on a target and transmission of the coordinates to the tracking computer on the aircraft permits tracking of a moving target.  The received information is processed by the tracking computer and output as a properly formatted target to the SEAIP.  Offsets may be entered in for the target position, if desired.  The scan function may be utilized about the moving point as well.A reflective memory ring (RMM) is available to connect multiple systems (sensors, gimbal data, IMU data, etc.) to permit data sharing at a high data rate.  All systems equipped with an RMM card have access to selected data from other systems on the network.  The RMM boards communicate by optical fiber in a ring configuration.Figure 5 shows the flow of information for GPS tracking, as implemented with the RMM.  		Figure 5    GPS tracker3.7   Sensor Data Display RTTC has developed a moving map display for use with sensors under test in the SEAIP.  This display is used to provide improved situational awareness to the operator, and displays aircraft/target position on a digitized map or geo-referenced photograph.  Gimbal pointing information can be used to display sensor field of regard with respect to the map or photograph.  This function is called the spotlight mode, as the conical angle of the sensor’s FOV is projected onto the display map, much as a spotlight beam would illuminate the ground.  Aircraft position and sensor ground view provide a means for accurately repeating test runs as well as acquiring non-visible, obscured, distant, or small targets with the sensor.  Data is presented real-time in an easy-to-understand graphical format, and sensor performance may be assessed during the test. One configuration of the moving map is shown in Figure 6.  This figure shows actual aircraft position displayed on a scaled digital photograph, with overlaid sensor pointing and hit data.   The moving map consists of an easily customizable graphical user interface (GUI) interface with a series of  text boxes that show important data coming from the SEAIP and the sensors.  This data is sent to the moving map through the RMM (section 3.6).  The moving map takes the needed data from the RMM and processes it to provide a clear depiction of events as they occur during a test.  The moving map displays a geo-referenced 2d map (or digitized photograph) with the location of 3d objects displayed on top of it.  The intersection of sensor field of view (FOV) with the ground is also shown.  Pre-surveyed points (for example: GPS coordinates, release points for surrogate chemical agents, location of static targets, etc.) may be displayed on the map.  The moving map can also show interactive (moving) points such as target vehicles (cars, boats, aircraft, etc.) either on the ground or in the air.  The system operator can use the moving map to immediately determine where these objects are, and can acquire them with the sensor if desired.  Another function will display a transparent color on the map at locations searched by the sensor.  This is useful to eliminate repetitive searches of previously viewed areas.  Flight paths may also be displayed, providing pilots with a means for accurate repetition of test runs.All data present on the RMM during flight may be collected on a data logger computer located in the instrumentation rack, if desired.  Upon conclusion of a test, recorded data may be played back through the moving map, and/or used for post processing.  This allows the test to be reviewed at any time as if it were actually occurring.  Map or photograph backgrounds may be changed during replay, permitting a visual sensor performance assessment against alternate criteria.  Sensor/map data may be collected during replay for use in later analysis or reports.Figure 6.  Moving map showing sensor detection3.8   Sensor IntegrationSensors mounted within the SEAIP must be balanced and tuned for each configuration.  Balancing the sensor configuration about each gimbal axis is critical in eliminating unbalanced torques within the stabilization loop.  Tuning must be done after each installation in order to account for differences in payload inertia.  This involves adjusting the gain and phase margins to account for stimulus vibration frequencies created by the helicopter, and to account for the moment of inertia of the sensor package.  Notch filters may be implemented to avoid troublesome frequencies, with a cost in stabilization performance.  Sensor mounts are made as rigidly as practical to minimize any resonance within the system.  4.  Distributed Test Capability4.1   Synthetic Environment Integrated Testbed Distributed Test Event 4 Overview The purpose of distributed testing is to prepare for the future as systems become much more network oriented.   The Synthetic Environment Integrated Testbed (SEIT) Distributed Test Event 4 (DTE 4) demonstration was a nationwide test that integrated geographically distributed live players/simulations into a simulated combat situation.   Test centers throughout the U.S. participated in this simulation.   These included:  Army Evaluation Center, Operational Test Command, Developmental Test Command, White Sands Missile Range, Electronic Proving Ground, Aberdeen Test Center, Dugway Proving Ground, Aviation Technical Test Center, Redstone Technical Test Center, Night Vision and Sensors Electronic Division, and Yuma Proving Ground.  These centers represented six interrelated threads: Chemical & Biological (CB), Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), Infrared ISR, Command, Control, Communications, Computers (C4), Robotic Intelligence, Mobility and Live Platform.  4.2   SEAIP Supporting Distributed Test The SEAIP was chosen to act as an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) surrogate in support of the SEIT DTE 4 demonstration.  An IR and visible camera were mounted in the SEAIP gimbal and bore-sighted to a common LOS.  A picture of these sensors mounted in the SEAIP is shown in Figure 7.  This configuration was chosen to represent the Shadow UAV.  The aircraft was also equipped with a real-time differential GPS tracking system for aircraft position information.  The aircraft was then flown over Test Area 3, Redstone Arsenal, AL.  A screen shot of the SEAIP Moving Map display is shown in Figure 8.  These show the UH-1, represented as a Shadow UAV, as it flew over Test Area 3 during the SEIT DTE 4 demonstration.  During the demonstration, the SEAIP would go into a search mode when cued. This consisted of flying orbits at an altitude of 1000 feet AGL over Test Area 3 with the SEAIP operator “searching” for the target.  A T-72 tank located on Test Area 3 was the chosen target.  At a designated time in the test event, the SEAIP operator located and locked onto the target.  The aircraft then began to circle the T-72 to mimic battle damage assessment of the target.  This continued for approximately 2 to 7 minutes.  The operator then broke lock and began to search for the target until the next scheduled time.   The video of the target and GPS position of the helicopter were down-linked to a ground station.  The aircraft GPS position was then translocated to the position at White Sands Missile Range.  The video and GPS data was then networked to the Distributed Test Communications Center at Redstone Arsenal for display and recording. .  Figure 7.

CONCLUSIONS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThe SEAIP has been used in support of numerous sensor tests since 1998.  Sensors have been tested very early in their developmental/acquisition cycle, sometimes several years before a form factor was achieved which would permit use in a missile seeker or UAV gimbal.  Large prototype sensor systems have been able to integrate into the SEAIP; these would have previously been unable to test in an airborne environment without further development.  Sensors tested include IR, MMW, SAL, LADAR, Hyper-spectral, visible imaging, and multi-mode.  The recent development of the GPS tracker has provided a method for acquiring and tracking distant or non-visible targets. Real-time mapping features permit rapid assessment of data, and maximize the effectiveness of flight time.  Use of the GPS based scan functions have been successful, and have provided insight into the needs for future scanning improvements.  As a UAV test-bed, the SEAIP provides a platform to quickly investigate emerging sensor technologies as they become available.  Use of a manned aircraft permits flight over urban areas, and provides general flexibility for test schedules and locations.  Future developments will include the capability to GPS track non-surveyed points (spontaneous GPS track), and implementation of advanced sensor scanning functions.   Special thanks are given to Richard Nesbit and Chuck Ricketts, of ERC Corporation, for their software development support of the Airborne Systems Branch. Author BiographiesTIMOTHY RICKS is the Captive Flight Test lead for the Airborne and Field Sensors Test Branch, Redstone Technical Test Center (RTTC), Redstone Arsenal, AL.
