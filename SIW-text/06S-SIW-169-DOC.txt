Name of Forum or Group:  System Acquisition and Product DevelopmentChairJim CoolahanVice ChairTim JahrenSecretaryCrash KonwinObjectives for this Workshop:Sharing actual experiences from both industry and government regarding M&S standards, information sharing, reuse, collaboration, business cases, policy and process, as applied to system acquisition and product development (SAPD).Identifying approaches to key M&S issues in SAPD, and lessons learned in M&S application to SAPD.Comments and Recommendations:SAPD’s invited NASA presenter gave a comprehensive view of NASA’s plans for Integrated Modeling and Simulation (IM&S) at the “right” stage of their approach.  Establishment of IM&S as part of systems engineering is the right place to put it. There was an invitation for dialog between DoD and NASA, for which SISO can provide a continuing forum.The continuing growth of computing power is providing the opportunity to apply new techniques to system/component design (e.g., genetic algorithms, 06S-SIW-089), adding to the M&S toolkit.  An interesting question is how these techniques can be applied at the enterprise level.On mixing interoperability protocols (e.g., HLA, TENA, DIS), although 06S-SIW-089 provided excellent documentation of “heroic efforts” to accomplish a tactical task, the PRP does not agree that mixed interoperability protocols is a good long-term solution.Admin note: The PRP agreed that East Hall room 2 was the worst conference room venue we have ever experienced. Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)21Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)25Peak attendance (including joint sessions)75Total papers presented7“No-show” presentations0Other presentations and panel discussions1Note:  Only four presentations occurred outside of joint sessions, in the early and late morning sessions.
