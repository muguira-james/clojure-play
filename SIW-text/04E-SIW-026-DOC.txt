Note that AWSIM and NGTS were located at the DMOC, transferring entities between each Environment generator (EG) using the same Local Area Network (LAN), and the entities were transferred manually.  The test conducted during JEFX 04 System Integration Test I transferred entities across a Wide Area Network (WAN), and entities were transferred manually and automatically.  The test plan, equipment used, and JEFX 04 SIT I test results are described in detail in the following sections.Transfer of Control Test PlanThe test plan is divided into two parts:  The technical test plan, and the operational test plan.Technical Test PlanThe network would be configured such that the Transfer of Control (TCR), Set Data, and Acknowledge DIS PDUs would pass through the DMOC DIS Filter.  The DIS Filter software was modified to include the TCR, Set Data, and Acknowledge PDUs.  The DIS DMOC Air LAN.  The DIS Filter is planned for use during JEFX 04; therefore this opportunity was used to test the DIS Filter software modifications.  The test equipment used was:DMOC Test Equipment:NGTS Software and IOS, DMOC Development VersionRedsim Data LoggerMaster Simulation (MSIM) GatewayMSIMF-15C simulatorDMOC DIS FilterSTAGE Environment GeneratorASTi DIS Voice EquipmentT-1 between DMOC and AFC2TIG.AFC2TIG Test Equipment:AWSIM, Version 2.6.2ASTi DIS Voice EquipmentScenario:  Southwest AsiaExercise ID:  30Red Aircraft:  MiG 29Armament:  4 AA-10s and 2 AA-11s.The network diagram is shown in Figure 1.Figure 1.  Transfer of Control Network DiagramOperational Test PlanThe operational test plan would first establish a playbox, using a Southwest Asia (SWA) scenario location.  The operational test would be:Establish 4 Combat Air Patrol (CAPs) for the red aircraft, MiG 29s.  The MiG 29s would be carrying 4 AA-10s and 4 AA 11s.Launch 4 four ship flights of red aircraft and proceed to designated CAPsROE for Red Aircraft is weapons holdDMOC initiate manual transfer of control of designated AWSIM red aircraft and execute engagements.DMOC WTT Pilots would notify and coordinate with ECS controllers.  ECS controllers would monitor and coordinate engagementIf any red aircraft survive WTT engagement, these would be transferred back to AWSIM.  AWSIM controller would monitor weapons and fuel status on AWSIM Air Status Displays and report to DMOC NGTS operator to verify successful transfer.Repeat steps d – f with a more complex air picture, including additional red and blue aircraft.Repeat steps d – f, except use NGTS Automatic transfer of control function. Transfer of Control Test ExecutionThe transfer of control test execution was conducted 10 – 12 December 2003, during JEFX SIT 1.  The test phases and results are described next.3.1	Manual Transfer of Control Test ResultsThe transfer of control was tested in two modes: Manual, and Auto Modes.  The manual mode was tested first.  The NGTS operator first verified that the red entities were generated from AWSIM.  Then, the NTGS operator selected an external entity via a menu for an entity transfer to be initiated in the pull (Ref 3) mode.  The NGTS TCR menu is shown in Figure 2.  Next, the NGTS software configured a TCR PDU in the pull mode with the recipient identified as AWSIM, and sent it to the DIS LAN.  NGTS generated one TCR PDU for each operator requested entity transfer.  There were a total of 4 MIG 29s that were pulled from AWSIM to NGTS.  Figure 2.  NGTS TCR Menu Options Next, STAGE blue entities engaged and killed 3 of the 4 NGTS entities.  The fourth entity was transferred back to AWSIM.  Weapons expended were 2 AA-10s and 2 AA-11s.  Fuel status showed approximately 4000 pounds of fuel was expended, which was verified by the AWSIM operator. Next, tests were conducted with the DMOC F15C Weapons Tactics Trainers (WTTs) in two main engagements. First, the WTT was targeted against an 8-ship of AWSIM red air.  The AWSIM red air consisted of a four-ship of Mig-23s and a four-ship of Mig-29s.  The WTTs engaged the Mig-29s after NGTS initialed a manual transfer of control.  During the engagement, NGTS did not appear to consistently shoot when within shot range, and the WTTs did not see launch indications, but received audible radar warning.   The Mig-29 shot and killed one WTT. The WTTs were reset and engaged a three-ship of Mig-29s.  The lead Mig-29 merged head on with the WTT but never shot.  The WTT then engaged the lead Mig-29 that did not appear to react.  The trail Mig-29 then shot and killed the WTT.  The entities were not transferred back to AWSIM as they dropped out right after the engagement.Automatic Transfer of Control Test ResultsThe auto mode shifts the monitoring responsibility from the NGTS operator to the application software itself.  The system is initialized at start up with a list of all potential AWSIM entities that are eligible for the transfer of control and their criteria.  The criteria include the range of the virtual simulators.  A typical configuration file is shown in Figure 3.This configuration file indicates the transfer of control will occur once the AWS_* entities are within 20 Nautical Miles of the WTT_01 entity.  This configuration file was used in the automatic transfer of control test.  The automatic transfer of control transfer function is shown in Figure 4.  The first automatic transfer of control engagements were conducted with STAGE blue air entities.  When STAGE entities came within the 20-mile activation range of an AWSIM entity, AWSIM entities were automatically transferred from AWSIM to NGTS.  During this test, three MiG-29s were automatically pulled from AWSIM to NGTS.  A fourth one was also pulled, but it disappeared somewhere during the pull.  During this engagement, two of the transferred MiG-29s were killed, and one of	Figure 4.  NGTS Engagement Zonethe STAGE F-15s was killed.  All of the destroyed MiG-29s still controlled by NGTS continued to send out ES PDUs until deleted from NGTS.  These ES PDUs marked the entity as destroyed, with 0 speed, and an altitude of 1foot.  It appeared that for at least one of the pulled MiG-29s, NGTS was sending out ES PDUs with the marking field changed.  The IOS was displaying the correct call sign, but the DIS Analyzer, RedSim, showed the entity state monitor was different (e.g. MG73 instead of MG30#4).  Another test was conducted where a 4 ship of MiG 29s were transferred automatically.  The DMOC WTTs engaged and killed 3 of the 4 MiG 29s.  The fourth MiG was not killed so that the push function back to AWSIM could be tested.  The fourth MiG 29 was pushed back to AWSIM, where weapons expended and fuel used was consistent with the engagement.  4.	Planned Enhancements and Other Transfer of Control ApplicationsThe planned enhancements for transfer of control are:Incorporate changes from the DIS Transfer of Control Study Group,Transfer Blue Constructive Air Entities,Transfer Ground Entities, both red and blue, andTransfer Virtual and Constructive Entities. The same challenges exist when reconciling the needs of large-scale operational-level simulation with tactical-level shooters.ConclusionTransfer of control between operational and tactical simulations was successfully demonstrated during JEFX 04 SIT 1, where the simulations used were connected by T-1.  These test results show that transfer of control can be conducted over a WAN, rather than locally.   The transferred air entities then applied higher fidelity engagements to enhance tactical level training when required.  The knowledge gained from this experiment is beneficial in many ways, but more work is required in refining the DIS process and standardizing the Set Record PDU.    Future use for Transfer of Control is planned for the Joint Expeditionary Force Experiment (JEFX) 04 SPIRAL 2, SPIRAL 3, and Experiment Execution.  Some NGTS fixes and enhancements will be incorporated for the experiment, and the transfer of control process will again be tested.  Additional results and information will be included in subsequent papers when they are available.6.
