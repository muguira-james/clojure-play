Since Helicopter SAF requires complicated behavior on 3 dimensional space. It also has to consider the effect of wind velocity, direction, terrain etc. Actual situation in battle space has uncertainty that is difficult to express in the usual simulation. In this study, we have developed helicopter SAF model at first in Japan and confirmed the effectiveness of our model. The characteristics of study are as follows. 1) This helicopter has ‚Äúintention‚Äù by applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) theory. So it will behave as autonomic and judge by itself. 2) Applying Rule Based Reasoning (RBR) and Case Based Reasoning (CBR), we can reflect the proficient pilot behavior to our developed model. As the result, the helicopter conducts with much complicated flying pattern as terrain avoidance, nap of the earth etc. 3) In this model, the operator has set mission to search enemy which location is unknown. The helicopter theorizes the location of enemy and plans the flight scheme using AI theory. 4) Algorithm for detecting enemy is based on the searching pattern data that we have surveyed from a proficient watchman. 5) Enemy can also detect the Helicopter by using radar and watchman. And they can assault the helicopter by missile. 6) Regarding environmental federation, we use digital map data and input weather data as visibility, ceiling, cloudy status, wind velocity, wind direction etc. Hence, we can realize more actual meteorological situation than existing simulation. 7) To scrutinize helicopter-flying pattern, we can conduct complicated simulation by using simpler rules for the helicopter flight pattern than usual one. A computer‚Äôs processor is required less work than usual RBR. As the result, we found the way to conduct major scale federation or more realistic simulation than existing model.1. Introduction    Helicopter CGF require more complicated pattern of behavior than it of Tank does, because helicopter move in three dimensional space and can stop in the air (=hovering), move up- down, left- right and also it can possible to fly nap of the earth. Considering the expansion of today‚Äôs battle space, the value of tactical simulation using helicopter is very important. For example, applying this methodology to Search & Rescue mission, we can expect an improvement of survivability.   From this point of view, we have developed helicopter SAF simulation model at first in Japan.             However, a current simulation based on the scenario the fixed behavior, and is not enough to predict and plan helicopter‚Äôs complicated behavior on the real environment varying from moment to moment, such as terrain avoidance, nap of the earth etc.     In this study, our developed model has ‚Äú intention‚Äù by applying Artificial Intelligence theory and aimed to behave basically on the scenario and to change own behavior properly according to mutable situation change.    This paper describes the contents and effectiveness of our helicopter SAF model.2. Architecture for Helicopter SAF Model by using Distributed Interactive Simulation Methodology     To realize more actual simulation, we have to interactive each entity, such as natural environment, weather condition, helicopter, tank etc. and combined together. We create distributed interactive middle-ware based on HLA /RTI 1.3 architecture. Outline Process of federation in this model is shown in Fig. 1[1].      The step for this federation is as follows.Federation is conducted by FOM (Federation Object Model) written in HLA.Exchange information among each entity is conducted through RTI.Each federate can change entity value which belong to each entities and mutual interaction is conducted by send or receive message.Each federate manage their time processing by conduct exchange information among other federate.  2.1 Applying Artificial Intelligence Theory to Helicopter SAF       The situation-related operator in this federation is limited in choosing flight plan. Other situation as flight pattern, detection, return, terrain avoidance, nap of the earth etc. is defined by autonomously. However, these complicated fight behavior are characteristic of helicopter. Applying reasoning model, which has studied on Artificial Intelligence theory is, requires controlling and judging autonomously. For this reason, we have compared and evaluate which model is most adequate forhelicopter SAF federation. Table 1[2] shows the results of comparison among each reasoning method apply to our model. As a consequence of study, hypothesis reasoning is not proper because there are much many hypothesis produced in major scale simulation. Dempster Shafer (DS) reasoning is as well as it, because it is difficult to gain enough accuracy by itself. And fuzzy reasoning, neurotic theory are also improper, because time restriction is very tight as helicopter flight.„ÄÄ„ÄÄAccording to this study, Rule Based Reasoning (RBR) and Case Based Reasoning (CBR) are culled for prospect. To obtain high accuracy when we use CBR, it have to accumulate quantitative data regarding helicopter‚Äôs flight pattern. However, as it is difficult to accumulate these fight pattern data, CBR is not best fit for our study. On the other hand, although RBR has problem that it has tendency to increase work of computer processor, it can simulate high accuracy to unknown event when priority and redundancy of category have added to meta-rule.     As the result, RBR was adopted in reasoning for flight behavior at helicopter SAF. Hence flight planning is necessary for actual simulation, however, relationship among fuel consumption and flight path, weather condition, particularly wind direction and velocities are quantified and obviously. CBR is proper when relationship is clear and data accumulated enough. From this point of view, we adopt RBR for helicopter‚Äôs fight behavior and CBR for flight planning.   2.2 Federation Scenario using Helicopter SAF   The scenario for this study is as follows.Digital ground map data (500m√ó500m) is used for environmental federation.Enemy‚Äôs location is fixed and mission of helicopter is search, detection and return.Pilot‚Äôs watch makes detection of enemy and simulation is finished within flight plan.Enemy can use radar and watchman; it can also assault by missile (not guided missile).   In this federation, operator has only to set up initial location of enemy, after that the model conduct autonomously based on the result of RBR and CBR.   That is, our developed model is able to conduct more realistic simulation than exiting model by using reasoning methodology only an addition of initial situation, hence it can be accommodate every situation by alter initial condition flexibly.3. Modeling and Federation Rule     Production rule for flight pattern and flight planning of helicopter is defined.3.1 Assumption Condition for Modeling   Assumptions for helicopter fight behavior are as follows. 1) Detection rule, 2) an influence of weather condition, particularly visibility, 3) the best setting at distance, 4) How to setting rule for run away and get away.    Next, fundamental item required for flight planning is as follows. 1) Fuel consumption, 2) Judgment definition for detection and it for detected by enemy.  3.2 Setting of Production Rule   Details of production rules are as follows.Missile assault is made by direct fire and not thinks about leading fire. Do not use guided missile.FOV (Field Of View) of pilot use detection probability when set at scan rate.Regarding vegetation; forest is impossible to see, wood is visible.Detection by enemy is equivalent to enemy‚Äôs assault. Each component rule is as follows.‚Ö† Rule for found by enemyProbability for found by enemy rise proportion to visibility.Definition for ‚Äúfound by enemy‚Äù is equivalent to assault by enemy. Probability for found by enemy riser when helicopter enters into radar detection area and range of watching.‚Ö° Detection rule for enemyDetection probabilities rise when the distance between helicopter and enemy is in the radar or watchman detection range. And when the visibility is high, probability will rise.Judgement criteria are defined that monotonous increase of detection probability at three times consecutively.‚Ö¢ Fuel consumptionFlight at low altitude, low velocity takes more fuel consumption than usual flight. Wind direction, velocity also affects it.If searching is difficult, fuel consumption shall increase. In this case, there are return or emergency landing. Emergency landing means mission failure.Flight plan is made by CBR preceded federation, and calculate cruising range, mission time.‚ÄúWarning‚Äù or ‚ÄúCaution‚Äù sign is shown when fuel shall.Fig. 2[3] shows fundamental flight behavior algorithm. 4. Design of Helicopter SAF Federation Model  Fig. 3Ôºª3ÔºΩ show data flow among each federate. Federation is composed of control / display federate which control distributed interactive mechanism and display‚Äôs situation, helicopter federate which control helicopter fight behavior and flight planning, and enemy / environmental federate which control enemy and environmental model. These federate conduct distributed interactive federation through RTI.4.1 Function of helicopter federateThis federate conduct helicopter fights simulation. Helicopter fight pattern has two types. One is set by scenario, the other is defined by RBR and it can behave autonomously. This helicopter has optical sensor equivalent to human eye; it can detect enemy (tank). Fig. 4-show logic algorithm for helicopter flight simulation.Simulation process conducts every federation time slice (1 sec.). Simulation is over when helicopter is destroyed by missile or reaches final goal.4.2 Control and Display FederateControl and display federate set up scenario on federation; knowledge rule to control helicopters behavior and displays the status of federation.Simulation process conducts every federation time slice (1 sec.).4.3 Environmental / Enemy FederateEnvironmental / enemy federate control environmental model and enemy (tank). This tank equipped radar, optical sensor equivalent to human eye and missile. It has function to assault helicopter. Fig. 5 shows sensor detection algorithm.Simulation process conducts every federation time slice (1 sec.).4.4 Conception for database construction   As think about database construction based on CBR, following items are reflected.Fuel consumption at hovering state is impossible to estimate it is calculate by operation time. Critical parameters related power is weight, wind velocity. This federation chooses most adequate power to conduct mission.When helicopter conduct hovering, nose shall be forwarded the opposition direction to wind direction. Because it can get higher lift than other direction.5. Conduct Federation and Evaluate    Helicopter SAF federation was conducted by our developed model. Digital map data (500m√ó500m mesh data) used this federation (Fig 5). Fig 6 shows plane figure. And three-dimensional figure is shown in Fig. 7.   Evaluation items on conducting federation as follows.Distributed interactive operation and data exchange among helicopter federate, control / display federate and environmental / enemy federate can be conduct according to HLA definition.Low detective flight behavior as nap of the earth can be conducted autonomously.Evasion action can be conduct when helicopter is attacked.Terrain avoidance at mountain area can be conduct and also it can set the most efficient fuel consumption at path.To confirm influence of weather condition, particularly visibility. To grasp relationship between fuel consumption and mission time, if model judge to conduct mission is impossible then helicopter return quickly.To confirm the situation of emergency landing.   Evaluation was conducted these 7 items. As the result, our developed model was satisfied with requirement except for 5) and 7). Regarding 5), the affect of visibility is unclear in this federation. There is no case about 7), because this federation is not use guided missile, hence evasion action is comparatively easy. We will study about this effect continuously. And we have also confirmed that our model is possible to less work than usual RBR.6. Conclusion and Future Work ‚Äì Phase ‚Ö°  The helicopter SAF federation model based on HLA / RTI was developed at first in Japan by authors. We have also confirmed autonomous behavior of entity (helicopter) and effect of distributed interactive federation. For the consequences, the effectiveness of this model was verified.  Next steps are as follows. 1) Correct the rule to realize the more simple definition to express more complicate flight behavior and to consider the construction of model based reasoning. 2) To conduct formation flight. 3) To realize more complicated federation by enemy moving. We are going to develop more sophisticated and advanced helicopter SAF model. 7.
