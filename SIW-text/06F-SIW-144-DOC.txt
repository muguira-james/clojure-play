Most papers presented at this SIW did relate to the stated focus of human behavior representation in M&S.  Others not directly related to this theme addressed relevant training issues associated with simulation-based training, either live, virtual, or constructive.  Information about the SCORM-SIM Study Group was presented during the morning introduction.  In general, presenters did a good job presenting papers and answering questions.  The schedule was executed as advertised without any problems.  Several apparent issues were identified and are discussed further.   Performance Data Standards Issues.  One of the topics that came up in Wink Bennett’s Learning Management for Competency Based Training presentation (073) related to a list of potential SISO areas of interest and involvement, specifically why the Training Forum would and should be interested and involved in human centered performance data standards.  The discussion was a positive one highlighting the importance of getting some details on how much of what kind of data needs to be provided by operational and training systems.  The data are essential for training assessment and can also be used (if developed at a fine enough grain size) to feed test, evaluation, and validation activities. The data and data standards issue is a unique one given that it impacts how and what systems provide in terms of data on humans and their interactions with the systems.  It therefore drives data requirements for live systems, range instrumentation, and training and rehearsal training devices and simulators.  The discussion centered appropriately on the need to drive a combination of items in a study that included the raw data elements, the consolidated data that come post analysis via some set of tools and algorithms, and the reporting and display of the data for training assessment.  One paper (Representing Human Performancewith Human Performance Measurement Language, 089) discussed the development of a human performance markup language that fit in very nicely with the data requirements discussed in paper 073. There was a recommendation to put together a panel session for an upcoming SISO conference where some further discussion from key stakeholders would be undertaken.  Wink Bennett took an action item to develop a panel proposal for the Fall 07 SIW conference.Interoperability Issues.  Interoperability or, more appropriately, lack of interoperability is a common theme in many Training Forum presentations. Interoperability is generally perceived as a desirable attribute and lack of interoperability is considered a shortcoming. Interoperability has achieved the status of dogma to the extent that if a simulation lacks interoperability with other, usually dissimilar simulations – flight simulators with battlestaff simulations, for example - it is considered to be deficient. Very often, however, lack of interoperability is due to the lack of fundamental understanding in the class of phenomena which is being simulated. This was particularly evident in the presentations on human behavior modeling and military multi-resolution simulation although in different ways. Military simulation professionals, especially those associated with joint and DoD-level agencies appear to lack knowledge about the science of human behavior extent in other domains. Also, there appears to be a desire not to attribute lack of interoperability among military training simulations to the fact that there is no real science – formalisms, quantitative theory - in military operations. As a result, the military M&S community usually assumes that interoperability is a technical challenge and not one of underlying ignorance. Simulation can be very useful to extend understanding, and to create and test theory. However, “plug and play” interoperability and the standards needed to achieve this degree of interoperability should be emphasized only for those applications in which the underlying phenomena or the application is well structured.End of session discussion.  The wrap-up discussion that concluded the Training Forum was one of the most provocative ones in recent years, Rick Severinghaus started off by proposing that there is fundamentally no difference between using a conventional simulation or a game for training purposes.  Hence, studies that were looking at what factors made a game good for training missed the wider issue that needs to be studied – namely what factors are important to achieve good overall training?  These factors and their impact on training and operational performance need to be identified over the full spectrum of training and then should enable quantitative assessment of how much fidelity, representation, immersion, etc, is necessary to achieve the right level of training.  It was also suggested that modern children and young adults (the games generation) actually learn things in a different way from their predecessors and that a study is needed to identify how they learn most effectively. Such a study should not be carried out by anyone over the age of 30 (which eliminated most of the audience!).  Previously completed, related studies should be identified.  	The follow-on discussion centered on how much fidelity is actually required to achieve successful training.  Graham Shanks felt that senior military users and procurement personnel always specify for more fidelity than is actually needed to provide proper training.  This is because they never actually undertook the training itself, but were seduced by what current technology could actually provide (at a price). No specific conclusions were drawn on how this inflation of requirements could be avoided.  The discussion period ended with a general feeling that much study had taken place over the past few years on modeling the wider spectrum of conflict (including human behaviors) but that a more integrated approach is needed to really move things forward.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)32Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)39Peak attendance (including joint sessions)55Total papers presented12“No-show” presentations0Other presentations and panel discussions0Recommended Reading List nomination: 06F-SIW-056 – A Narrative Approach to Simulation-based Training06F-SIW-067 – Bringing Multi-Resolution into Sharper Focus for the Warfighter                 2006 FALL SIW OUTBRIEF FORM
