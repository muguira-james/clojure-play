IntroductionGeneralIn November 1999, the Fall INFORMS Conference was held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  Dr. Robert Might, the primary author for this paper, chaired a session on developing requirements for modeling and simulation (M&S).  In addition to Dr. Might’s introduction and discussion concerning what it takes to develop good requirements, the session featured talks from a number of speakers with subject matter expertise and research interests in requirements development for M&S.  Topics covered were:  “Working With Users to Develop M&S Requirements”, “Developing Requirements for Modeling Human Behavior”, “Developing a M&S Requirements Process for Representing the Natural Environment”, and “A Comparison of Requirements Tools for M&S Developers”.This paper describes a set of recommended practices for developing system requirements for M&S and highlights the common theme prevalent in each presentation from the requirements session in Philadelphia.  The common theme or thread was that a need exists for a formal requirements development structure for capturing and documenting requirements for M&S.  Many systems engineering tools exist to assist in developing and, or managing system requirements.  However, M&S system requirements vary according to the major system they describe (training, analysis, acquisition, etc.) and none of the tools studied is capable of capturing and managing all of the separate requirements essential for proper M&S development.Though the title of this paper is “Developing Requirements for Analytical Models and Simulations”, and the examples provided are for an analytical system, the word analytical could easily be replaced with training, acquisition, engineering, education, or any of the other major systems utilizing M&S sub-systems.  Each of the major systems has unique aspects that must be captured in the M&S sub-systems, but they have enough in common to develop a structured process and set of databases to capture system requirements to assist the M&S community develop credible M&S.PurposeThis paper will propose the development of a web-based tool that provides the structure, guidelines and essential data to help analysts, trainers and warfighters rapidly develop a comprehensive set of model and/or simulation requirements.  These requirements will be hierarchically linked – starting with user requirements and ending in system requirements that are sufficiently detailed to allow high-level design of a model or simulation system.The web-based tool will allow analysts, trainers and warfighters to collaborate over the Internet.  This team will be able to develop a comprehensive, properly structured, unambiguous and well written set of requirements for a model or simulation system development or major modification.  The tool will produce a Microsoft Word document for final editing and distribution.2. Justification The web-based tool will provide a common service [1] to all M&S developers for structured requirements development.The common service [1] ensures M&S developers have a common framework and tool set for developing requirements.The common toolset [1] promotes interoperability and reuse enhancing DMSO’s data standards.Requirement templates can be developed for virtually all M&S functional areas to ensure the representational resources [1] are complete enough for simulation development and they are concise and descriptive enough for the developer.Most importantly, credible requirements provide the essential link necessary for DMSO’s M&S Verification, Validity and Accreditation (VV&A) [1] efforts.  The requirements provide the traceability required by proper simulation VV&A.3. BackgroundModels and simulations are not stand-alone entities.  Models and simulations are a sub-system; that is, they are part of a larger system such as a training system or an analytical system.  A training system can include, as a minimum, the trainers, the trainees, the databases used in training, the physical environment in which the training occurs, hardware, support software and a model or simulation.  An analytical system can contain sub-systems such as analysts, databases, hardware, support software and a model or simulation. Models and simulation requirements must be derived from the M&S system requirements.  The importance of this fact will be discussed in the section below on “Proposed Structure and Databases.”  The term “M&S system” is used in this paper to refer to any system in which a model or simulation is a major sub-system.  This is to reduce the need to constantly refer to training systems, analytical systems, forecasting systems, etc. that contain models and/or simulations.  Designing and building an M&S system is a complex systems development process.  The people who manage this process must have domain knowledge (understanding about the user domain, models and simulations and the domain to be represented in the model or simulation) and systems development experience (practice in building complex systems, preferably M&S systems) (see Figure 3.1).  If either of these is lacking there is a significant risk that a M&S system will, in all likelihood, not be built on time, at the predicted cost and not function properly.Figure 3.1 System Requirements – Evolving Approach for Models and SimulationsFor example, when the Air Force needs a new aircraft they have people who understand airplanes and their missions (these would be pilots and senior AF leaders) and people who have extensive experience building airplanes (aeronautical companies such as Boeing) develop the requirements, design and build the new aircraft.  The Air Force would not have domain experts (pilots) work with a company such as Caterpillar Tractor to develop a new fighter aircraft.  Also, the Air Force does not put only pilots in charge of developing the formal requirements for the new aircraft.  These experts have a lot of the domain knowledge that is needed, but they do not have the experience needed to develop a comprehensive set of requirements that will “drive” the development of a new aircraft.  The proper team to develop the requirements is the domain experts (pilots and others) and systems engineers who have extensive experience in aircraft development.In the modeling and simulation arena there are at least two very important sets of domain experts: users (e.g. analysts and trainers) and military operators (warfighters).  The latter set is comprised of the people who execute the myriad of missions that our military is called upon to perform.  Warfighters are involved in the development of models and simulations because they are often the leaders and managers of the organizations that use M&S systems and they define what must be modeled or simulated.In almost all cases, the analysts, trainers and warfighters called upon to identify the needs and develop the requirements for new or improved M&S systems do not have experience in requirements development.  Unfortunately, if the requirements are: incomplete, inadequately structured, ambiguous or just poorly written the probability of a M&S system developer getting “it right” in a timely manner and on cost is very small.  In addition, if the analysts, trainers and warfighters don’t have the requisite experience to develop the requirements they may also lack the judgment essential to select a contractor who really knows how to develop a M&S system.There are logical reasons why analysts, trainers and operators never get the experience needed to develop model and simulation requirements.   Many analyst and trainers are assigned to their position as a “secondary” duty, and they are given this duty after serving operational tours.  Most analysts or trainers are then returned to operational assignments after fulfilling their two or three years of secondary duty.  This leaves little time to develop into credible analysts or trainers and leaves less time to transition replacements.  In addition, there are very few systems engineers who have experience developing requirements for models and simulations – only a few systems engineers would understand the importance of “representation requirements” that are unique to model and simulation development.4. Past ProblemsThe following is a partial list of problems that make the development of requirements for an M&S system difficult, or even impossible:M&S system developers can assume that users know when they have a need for a M&S system, but M&S developers mistakenly assume that users know how to satisfy that need.  That is, developers accept the user’s solutions to their problems rather than study the requirements and develop the proper solution.M&S system users usually know what their needs are, but they don’t know how to articulate them.M&S system users seldom know the difference between a good set of requirements and a bad set of requirements.M&S system users usually don’t know the best way to solve their problems, but they are willing to “provide” at least one solution and call it a requirement.M&S systems that are not developed to satisfy clear, unambiguous user requirements often become a disaster - they either fail or are far more expensive to develop than necessary [2], [3].M&S system developers can’t assume that M&S system users understand how M&S systems are developed – developing an M&S system is not just another software project [2].Many M&S system users do not understand how models and simulations work.M&S system users often have a vocabulary that is very different than that of the people hired to satisfy their needs or solve their problem (i.e. system developers).M&S system users often have trouble communicating with the people hired to satisfy their needs or solve their problem.M&S system users and M&S system developers seldom have time to talk, regardless of their desire to communicate.All of these problems make the need for a good set of M&S system requirements essential.  However, there never seems to be enough time to develop a good set of requirements.  This problem is exacerbated by the fact that the people responsible for writing the requirements don’t understand what should be in the requirements and how the requirements should be structured.5. Solution OverviewThe proposed solution to these problems is to provide, via a website, the information and structure that is needed to develop high quality M&S system requirements in less than one month.  Our solution will be developed in three stages:5.1 Stage OneInternal development of initial databases on the primary functions and representation requirements for anticipated M&S systems.  Most of these databases will, of course, be developed over a period of time and the specific scheduling must be based on priorities that are established by the appropriate government agencies and organizations.  The initial databases for a prototype will be identified during the first week of this effort.Internal development of a M&S system requirements structure that can be rapidly adapted for any model or simulation based on specific user needs for a M&S system.  This structure will be a major driver for the user interface for the web-based tools that will be developed during the effort.  The initial structure will be based on the DMSO Human Behavior requirements structure [4].Development of a prototype set of web-based tools that allow future M&S system users and warfighters to select the functionality and representation requirements that will satisfy their needs.Development of a prototype tool that converts the user selections of functionality and representation requirements into a Microsoft Word document that is based on the requirements structure.  Users can then edit this document in a stand-alone mode – just as if they had generated it in Microsoft Word. 5.2 Stage TwoThe databases and prototype tools will be reviewed and tested by real users and warfighters. Modifications will be made to the databases, the structure and the prototype tools based on the feedback from the users and warfighters.Review and, if desired, additional testing of the modified databases, structure and tools will be performed.5.3 Stage ThreeThe databases and tools will be hosted on a DMSO server for operational use.Databases will continue to be developed.  This can occur in two ways:The structure will allow users to develop new databases to satisfy their needs.  The structure and existing databases will make this a very practical approach.  The databases will then be available for other users.Organizations and agencies with specific M&S interests can fund independent database developments in anticipation of future requirements.6. Major BenefitsThere are many benefits to providing this capability to the M&S community.  The following are just a few:Models and simulations will no longer be developed in an “ad hoc” manner.Users and warfighters will have the structure they need to develop good requirements without the need to have systems engineers with years of experience developing M&S systems (a very rare commodity).It will only take one or two months to develop a comprehensive set of good M&S system requirements (one if a requirements representation database exists, two if major additions to an existing representation requirements database are needed).M&S system developers who are vying to develop a new system will have to show, in their proposal, how they are going to meet these specific requirements – thereby giving the government a consistent set of proposals on which to select the best developer.M&S development costs will be reduced.  Figure 6.1 from Barry Boehm’s book titled Software Risk Management [5] shows how costs escalate to fix software projects when errors are not detected early in the requirements and design phase of a project.Figure 6.1 Costs to Fix Errors Relative to Time of DetectionM&S developments can be more easily controlled; work can be halted or redirected as soon as a developer is unable to meet clearly identified requirements.All M&S system development activities will be traceable to clearly defined user and derived user requirements.The government will obtain far superior M&S systems.7.  Proposed Structure and Databases7.1 StructureRequirements must be structured to be useful.  This structure allows the buyer to ensure that all the detailed requirements and specifications are clearly traceable to a set of user requirements.  The structure also allows the developer to systematically control the development process to ensure the required functionality and representations are available in the appropriate sequence [6].The initial requirement structure that will be used in the internal development stage is as follows:User Requirements    Derived User Requirements        Functional Requirements            Allocated Functional Requirements                M&S Representation Requirements                Other sub-system RequirementsDefinitions and examples for each of these are provided in Appendix A [7], [8].  A more extensive set for one user requirement is provided in Appendix B [9].  Figure 7.1 below depicts the requirements structure described in this paper as part of the M&S Life Cycle.Figure 7.1 M&S Development – Requirements as Part of the M&S Life CycleUser Requirements are the wants and needs of the user – with appropriate justification.  There are two major sources for these requirements.  The first is a clear description of the behavior that the user wishes to provide.  This is described in terms of the user domain activities and tasks that are to be supported by the M&S system (e.g. training process, analytical process, etc.).  The second are the “non-behavior” needs, such as safety requirements, compliance with laws and regulations, inter-operability needs, standard operating procedures, etc.Every User Requirement must be further explained.  This results in Derived User Requirements that amplify and constrain the more aggregated User Wants and Needs (Requirements).  Without this added detail it would be impossible to develop a practical set of Functional Requirements.Functional Requirements define what the system must do.  Functional requirements are driven by both user “desired behavior” and other forms of requirements, such as safety, regulations, inter-operability, laws, standard operating procedures, etc.   These functional requirements are at the M&S system level – they do not yet refer to the model or simulation requirements.Allocated Functional Requirements identify what sub-system will perform each function.  There are some critical decisions that must be made when this is done.  Users must understand that these decisions have a major impact on the cost and time to develop an M&S system.  If the model or simulation is allocated a function that is very hard to perform in software (vice by a player or controller) it will cost more money and will take more time to develop than if the function was simply presented to a player or controller.  It is possible that these allocations will change as new versions of a system are released.  Hence, the functional allocation should reflect these changes for each anticipated version.The role of a model or simulation is to represent processes and entities in the M&S system.  Once a function has been allocated to a model or simulation there are many decisions on the level of aggregation for each representation.  The representation requirements are the key factor in the design of this sub-system.  There are times that some of these decisions must be left to the design engineers.  In these cases the user must specify why a process or entity must be represented.  When done properly this provides the design engineers with sufficient information to make the necessary representation decisions.  It is often possible that the user will know what level of representation is needed, but they must use caution when mandating this type of requirement.Other sub-system requirements (that is, those sub-systems other than the model or simulation) should be specified to the levels that are necessary to develop high-level sub-system designs.  Since these sub-systems can vary significantly among M&S systems, the web-based tools will provide a structure that will support M&S requirements development only; there will be some “other” sub-system database development required for each new M&S system.  Examples of other sub-systems, in a training system, are the databases used in training, the physical environment in which the training occurs, hardware, and support software, to name a few.  Other functional M&S areas such as analysis and acquisition will have similar “other” sub-systems.  Hopefully there will be enough similarity among future systems that there will be an existing database that help in this effort.7.2 DatabasesDatabases are basically hierarchical lists of options that M&S system users and warfighters can access and select.  The hierarchical nature allows the users to systematically determine what is and is not important in the M&S system.  For example, the first level in the hierarchy will ask the user or warfighters to select the major use of the M&S system.   The options would include applications such as:TrainingMilitary Operations Planning and AnalysisEducationForecastingSystems AnalysisEngineering AssessmentCombinations of  _____, _____, _____, ………Each of these applications will have a unique second level of selections, but they will also share many of the same options.  For example, a user selecting Military Operations Planning and Analysis will be asked to choose the military operations to be analyzed.  The listing will include operations such as:Conventional military conflictPeace OperationsNuclear conflictTerrorist actionsPara-military actionsEach of these operations will have a third level that provides appropriate options.  For example, the conventional military conflict will ask the users and warfighters to select from missions that must be represented in the M&S system.  This section will request the users or warfighters to clarify the reasons for including each mission.  If the mission is not an integral part of the essential functionality, it may be possible to provide just the effects of the mission in the M&S system, vice replicating the actual functions of the mission.  This is a critical point that may make or break the ability of a developer to meet the technical, cost and time goals for the development.  The data and the exact way in which these options will be presented to the users and warfighters will be determined during the prototyping effort.For example, if the operations include conventional military conflict, the list of potential missions could be provided in a matrix form for users. Users and warfighters will next be asked to identify the primary missions, the essential functions that must be replicated in the M&S system for each of these missions, and the level of impact the selected mission will have on other missions.  All of these decisions will be based on the intended use of the M&S system.  This in turn will trigger questions that will allow the users to accurately identify the essential functional requirements for all mission areas.  In some cases there will be explicit functional requirements, and in other cases there will only be structured descriptions of what is needed.  These choices will allow the design engineers to make the final decisions concerning which functions must be replicated and when the effects of some functions will suffice.When no database exists to support the selection process it will be necessary for the users and warfighters to develop the options that would normally be stored in the database.  The tools and existing databases (used as examples) will prompt the users and warfighters and help them develop the proper requirements at each level.  The structure remains constant.  Therefore, once users and warfighters understand the structure they will find it easy to develop the appropriate requirements at each level.  Templates will guide their options at each level.  The templates will provide the structure that the users and warfighters need as well as the structure that is need to convert their input into a Microsoft Word document.8. SummaryThere is a serious need for better requirements in the M&S community.  The lack of structured requirements for major developments such as JSIMS has caused significant delays and overruns.  The proposed approach allows people with extensive experience developing and teaching military modeling and simulation to share their knowledge and capability with people who are new to this area.The time and cost to develop one database is less than the amount individual programs are expected to spend on requirements development for an M&S system.  This is possible because the experience of the people developing the database makes them far more effective and efficient.Once a database is developed it will have components that will apply to other M&S systems.  In addition, a single database provides an excellent example to facilitate the development of new databases.In the future, the effort required to develop high quality, extremely useful M&S system requirements will be reduced and every new program will be able to complete the process in one or two months.9.

They describe what the user wants the model/simulation to accomplish. User Requirements are statements of what a model or simulation will be used for, only written in a manner that makes the use a requirement. For example, when a user says they want a simulation to train the staff of an armored brigade it is translated into the following user requirement: "The simulation must be capable of training the staff of an armored brigade." User Requirement for Integrated Air Defense Example: Provide an analyst the capability to determine the impact of alternative communication architectures within an IAD system.Derived User Requirements: Detailed analysis of the User Requirement. They bound a higher level requirement with an explicit explanation of what is actually needed. They define specified, implied, and essential tasks within the broadly, generally written User Requirement.  They are a more descriptive listing of the essential elements that a model must accomplish. Some Derived User Requirements for IAD Example: An analyst must be able to:Study alternative communication architecturesRapidly reconfigure  the communication Links within an IAD system during a studyModify the combination of communication links within an IAD system to reflect alternative plans and operationsStudy the impact of airspace saturation by enemy aircraft on the IAD communication architectureHigh Level Functional Requirements: Detailed descriptions of what must be accounted for by the system.  They identify what a system must be capable of doing to meet a Derived User Requirement.  They link the system functionality to the user needs. High Level Functional Requirements for IAD Example: The analytical system for the IAD simulation must provide:Attacker and Defender’s explicit and implicit tasks associated with higher command operation orders(OPORDS)Attacker’s air tactics, rules of engagement and standard operating proceduresAttacker ingress plan Defender’s planAllocated Functional Requirements: The assignment of High Level Functional Requirements to the components in the system. Critical decisions are made at this time that impact the simulation design. For example, a High Level Functional Requirement such as the representation of environmental factors may be allocated to the database, pre-processor, and simulation. The database will contain all combinations of environmental factors, the pre-processor will be initialized during run set-up with a set of environmental factors, and the simulation must account for environmental factors impacting operations. These decisions are made during the Modeling Decisions step, but are implied by the allocation of the High Level Functional Requirement to various system components. Allocated Functional Requirements for IAD Example: A user with the help of the model/simulation developer determines that the analytical system must have a database, pre-processor, post-processor, analyst and the simulation. Using the four high level functional requirements previously provided: M&S Representation Requirements: The requirements that define what and how entities and processes must be represented in the system to meet the functional requirements. Since functional requirements are directly traceable to the user requirements, the representation requirements for a given entity or process vary significantly based on the use of the system. They specify what elements, attributes, and factors concerning High Level Functional Requirements will be represented in the simulation. Developing the link from functional requirements to representation requirements is an art form that, often, requires excellent operations research skills. Simulation Representation Requirements may include representation considerations such as inputs, outputs, necessary level of detail, and entity attributes. Simulation Representation Requirements for IAD Example: Process - developing a Defender’s Plan:Process Representation - The process for representing the development of a defender’s plan will account for:Intelligence estimate of attacking aircraft Air Order of Battle(AOB)Intelligence estimate of attacking aircraft Electronic Order of Battle(EOB)Intelligence estimate of attacking aircraft System Performance and CapabilitiesEnvironmental factorsDefender’s weapon system performance and capabilitiesAvailable supporting systemsPositive an Procedural control measuresTiming FactorsAppendix B – Integrated Air Defense (IAD) Analytical Requirements ExampleUser RequirementProvide an analyst the capability to determine the impact of alternative communication architectures within an Integrated Air Defense (IAD) system.Derived User RequirementsAn analyst must be able to study alternative communication architectures, which includes as a minimum multi-service and allied systems.An analyst must be able to rapidly reconfigure the communication links within an IAD system during a study.An analyst must be able to rapidly modify the processing times at communication nodes in an IAD system.An analyst must be able to modify the capacities along any combination of communication links within an IAD system and at any node in an IAD system.An analyst must be able to configure communication links within an IAD system to reflect alternative tactical and operational plans as well as alternative Rules of Engagement (ROE).Communication links must automatically be modified during a simulation to reflect real-time decisions at all echelons of command.An analyst must be able to study the impact of airspace saturation by enemy aircraft on the IAD communication architectures.An analyst must be able to study the impact of real-time IAD component loses.An analyst must be able to study the interaction of Air-to-Air and Surface-to-Air weapons and engagement zones.An analyst must be able to study the impact on the communication architecture of integrating new technology into existing IAD systems.High Level Functional Requirements – The analytical system (including the simulation, database, pre-processor, post-processor and analyst) must:Account for the essential elements of all IAD and Air Attack operational goals, objectives, missions and OPORDS (both attacker and defender).Account for all reasonable IAD and Air Attacker explicit and implicit tasks associated with higher command OPORDS (attacker and defender).Account for variations in the defender’s estimate of the adversary air threat (e.g. Air Order of Battle – AOB). Account for alternative defender operational and tactical plans; with annexes that impact Air Defense (e.g. intelligence estimates of attacker’s Air Order of Battle, Air Space Control Plan, Rules of Engagement [ROE] etc.)Account for variations in attacker’s air tactics, rule of engagement (ROE) and standard operating procedures (SOPs).Account for variations in the defender’s estimate of attacker’s counter air defense capabilities.Contain or have access to attacker and defender’s primary systems data.Calculate or have access to attacker and defender’s primary systems capabilities information - derived from system data, environmental factors and situational factors.Account for variations in attacker and defender’s communication architectures.Calculate or have access to attacker and defender’s communication systems performance data and capabilities.Account for variations in attacker and defender’s C2 structure and procedures.Account for attacker and defender's Electronic Order of Battle (EOB).Account for alternative attacker’s ingress plans.Account for alternative defender’s plans.Account for attacker decisions/actions during execution at flight group level.Account for attacker decisions/actions by pilots.Account for defender decisions/actions during execution made above fire unit level.Account for defender decisions/actions during execution made at the fire unit level.Contain, calculate or have access to relevant environmental data.Account for environmental impact on system performance and capabilitiesProvide current Battlefield/Battlespace situation data - ground truth.Provide Battlefield/Battlespace situation information (i.e., ground truth with processing and estimating errors).Allocated Functional Requirements: EMBED Excel.Sheet.8  Modeling Decisions#8 Attacker and Defender’s primary systems capabilities information – Essential system capabilities that are not situation dependent will be calculated from the performance data in the pre-processor.  Situation dependent capabilities will be calculated, when needed, within the simulation.#9 Attacker and Defender’s communication architectures – Alternative architectures must be available for the initiation of any study.  Changes to the architecture (i.e. loss of nodes and/or links) can occur during the course of a single run.#10 Attacker and Defender’s communication systems performance data and capabilities – changes in the capabilities of the communication systems as a function of the environment and adversary actions must be accounted for.#13 Attacker ingress plans – General elements/characteristics of the ingress plan (e.g. high/low/high vice low/low/high) will be selectable by an analyst using the pre-processor.  The details of the ingress plan will be generated by the simulation based on both the general elements/characteristics and the attacker’s intelligence estimate of the situation.#14 Defender’s plans – Doctrine, standard tactics and techniques will be represented in some form in the database.   An analyst will be able to select variations on these as part of a run set-up.  The details of the plan (e.g. the exact placement of an Air Defense TEL) will be determined by the simulation as a function of the “chosen” doctrine, standard tactics/techniques and situational variables such as terrain, unit postures, and weather.  #15 & #16 Attacker decisions/actions – Flight group maneuvers will be represented using standard tactics and operating procedures that are appropriate for normal/anticipated situations.  Flight group decisions will not be dependent on personal attributes of the flight group lead (e.g. risk aversion, experience level, etc.).  Individual aircraft pilot decisions will be based on standard tactics and the judgment of the pilot based on current situational factors as well as the personal attributes of the pilot.#17 & #18 Defender decisions/actions – Command and control decisions above the fire unit level will be based on the guidance/orders (to include rules of engagement) from higher and standard operating procedures.  Individual commander attributes/characteristics will not be represented in these decisions.  Decisions at the fire unit level will be based on guidance/orders from higher (to include rules of engagement), standard operating procedures, situational variables, and the attributes/characteristics of the individuals in the unit.#20 Environmental impact on system performance and capabilities – Environmental impacts on system performance or capabilities that are not specifically related to a given situation in the simulation will be calculated in the pre-processor.  Environmental impacts that are situational dependent will be calculated in the simulation.#21 Battlefield/Battlespace situation data - ground truth - All changes in the environment and entities represented in the simulation will be calculated and maintained for use in all processes that are represented in the simulation or impact data retrieval during the simulation.#22 Battlefield/Battlespace situation information (i.e., ground truth with processing and estimating errors) – Data that is processed (either machine or human processed) has the potential for error.  The simulation will calculate and maintain separate variables to reflect the difference in ground truth and information that is derived from ground truth through some form of data processing.Simulation Representation Requirements:#8 Attacker and Defender’s primary systems capabilities information &  #18 Environmental impact on performance and capabilities -Entity representationsThe representation should provide the following entity capabilities:Sensor detection capabilities against single targets and groups of targets as impacted by the environmentSystem capability to classify targets once detectedAircraft maneuverability as impacted by the situation and the environmentMissile fly-out envelopesTEL movement rates as impacted by the environmentC2 and communication node processing rate statistics for relevant data and messagesCommunication network’s ability to reconfigure in real-timeCountermeasure capabilities as impacted by the situation and the environmentProcess representationsThe processes that impact the following characteristics and attributes of primary system entities will be represented:Primary systems availabilityPersonnel, in terms of system crews, availability and capabilityLocationSizeOperational statusContingency plans and proceduresCountermeasure capabilitiesEngagement system capabilitiesMovement rates#9 Attacker and Defender’s communication architectures  -Entity representationsThe following characteristics and attributes of communication nodes will be represented as impacted by environmental factors, situational factors and adversary actions:communication systems availableprocessing equipment/personnel availablelocationsizeoperational statusstandard message and data traffic with other nodescontingency plans and proceduresProcess representationsThe processes that impact the following characteristics and attributes of communication entities will be represented.
