IntroductionScenarios provide real world context and scope the simulation objects and environment requirements for federate simulations.  These scenarios eventually evolve into initialization data used to start a simulation.  In some cases the scenarios also specify scripted events.The High Level Architecture (HLA) Federation Development and Execution Process (FEDEP) describes a standardized process for development of HLA federations to meet the needs of a federation user or sponsor [1].  The FEDEP is described in terms of six steps.  Scenario development is a key activity in the development of the Federation Conceptual Model (step 2).The HLA Tool Architecture (see Figure 1) includes a component for a Scenario Development Tool [2].Terms such as ‚Äúscenario‚Äù are overloaded in the simulation community.  The definition provided by the U.S. Army‚Äôs Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Regulation 5-11 includes the following text:  ‚Äúgraphic and narrative description of the area, environment (geographical setting), means (political, economic, social, and military) and events of a hypothetical conflict during a future time frame‚Äù [3].The FEDEP states that scenarios include ‚Äúthe types and numbers of major entities that must be represented by the federation, a functional description of the capabilities, behavior, and relationships between these major entities over time, and a specification of relevant environmental conditions which impact or are impacted by entities in the federation‚Äù.  It also states that ‚ÄúInitial conditions (e.g., force laydowns), termination conditions, and specific geographic regions should also be provided‚Äù.Competing definitions from Joint publications as well as the perspectives of military Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) indicate a lack of consensus on what constitutes a scenario.  Specific issues with TRADOC‚Äôs definition include scripted events during the simulation and objectives of the simulation.The range of definitions contributes to the challenge of sharing scenario information.1.1 Need for Scenario Data InterchangeHLA federations could be developed and operated more effectively if they could share scenario data.  Scenario data could be shared between federate scenario generation systems prior to initialization to facilitate interoperability during runtime.  Also, scenario developers could reuse scenario contents from other simulation systems if they could access the scenario data.  The task of developing scenario-related tools could be simplified if they processed consistently formatted data.  Unfortunately, most simulations have been built in a ‚Äústove-piped‚Äù manner that precludes the simple reuse of scenario data between simulations.  Sharing scenario data currnently requires point to point interfaces that are expensive to develop and maintain.  This problem has led to research into interchanging scenario data.1.2 Previous Scenario Interoperability WorkA research project was conducted by the United States Military Academy (West Point) to demonstrate the ability to access legacy scenario data [4].The project utilized database mediation technology [5].  Specifically, the HERMES tool [6] was used to demonstrate how mediation rules could be used to drive the access of files.Concepts for HLA-related data interoperability in general [7] and scenario data specifically [8] have been presented at numerous Simulation Interoperability Workshops.Results from these efforts were used in the research described in this paper.1.3 Long Term ObjectivesIn order to focus current and future scenario interoperability efforts, a long term vision and set of objectives have been developed.The vision is to improve the timeliness, quality, and cost-effectiveness of developing HLA scenarios (and associated tools) by standardizing the interchange of scenario data.The timeliness, quality, and cost-effectiveness of developing HLA scenarios and scenario-related tools are the primary factors in the vision.  Therefore, the vision benefits/affects both scenario tool developers and scenario developers.  The ultimate beneficiaries are the sponsors that fund HLA federations.The following goals relate to the benefits of the effort.  These goals apply to developers of HLA scenario-related tools:Reduce the cost of developing interoperable HLA scenario-related tools,Reduce the time it takes to develop interoperable HLA scenario-related tools, andImprove the quality of HLA scenario-related tools;These goals apply to the developers of HLA scenarios:Reduce the cost of developing HLA scenarios,Reduce the time to develop HLA scenarios, andImprove the quality of HLA scenarios.The HLA DSB initiative will achieve the benefits goals described above by providing mechanisms.  Some of the mechanism goals are associated with tools:Provide an open standard to support making HLA scenario-related tools interoperable,Maximize the potential use of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) technology to support the development of scenario-related tools,Facilitate the reuse of HLA scenario-related tool components , andMinimize the impact of scenario data content and format changes on tool software.Other mechanism goals support scenario developers:Maximize the amount of HLA scenario data that a scenario developer can reuse from existing scenarios andSupport development of HLA scenarios as part of DoD simulation and training development processes (e.g., Joint Training System, HLA FEDEP).The approach to developing the mechanisms described above will be supported by the following goals:Guide tool developers by expanding on the HLA tool architecture with a scenario tool architecture,Develop standards for tool developers which comply with DoD interoperability and data standards,Support web-based scenario-related tools,Provide sample code and sample data to support HLA tool developers, andSupport scenario repository use by scenario developers.The HLA DSB vision will be achieved by focusing on the satisfaction of goals for achieving the benefits, developing the mechanism, and performing the approach.  These goals support both scenario tool developers and scenario developers.2. HLA DSB EffortThe HLA Dynamic Scenario Builder (DSB) initiative has focused on improving the timeliness, quality, and cost-effectiveness of developing HLA scenarios (and associated tools) by standardizing the interchange of scenario data.  This standardization effort has been supported by reviewing legacy simulation scenario data, defining an HLA scenario logical data model, and by developing an XML Data Interchange Format (DIF) for exchanging scenario data.2.1 Legacy Scenario Data AnalysisA review of existing (legacy) scenario data models was performed to help identify common scenario data elements.  The HLA DSB effort initially supports constructive training HLA simulation scenarios.  This distinction is important in focusing the analysis process and search for scenario metadata.  Relevance categories were identified in priority order to clarify the relative importance of each set of scenario data being reviewed.  Candidate simulation systems were then identified in prioritized order based on their relevance category.  The intent was to give priority to gathering highly relevant simulation scenario data models.As information on legacy and developing systems was gathered, a wide variety of representation formats were encountered.  Each data source was logged and added to the project library.Entity data is closely associated with the concept of a ‚Äúclass‚Äù in object-oriented technology.  An entity includes attributes that can be subentities or variables of a particular datatype.  The entity level was selected for extraction of key organizing principles in scenario descriptions.In extracting entities from data sources, certain ‚Äúbusiness rules‚Äù were employed.  One business rule was to focus on the ‚Äúproblem domain‚Äù portions of scenarios, rather than the ‚Äúsolution domain‚Äù which includes ‚Äúhow‚Äù a scenario will be supported.  Another rule involved focusing on data needed to initialize a simulation with ‚Äúreal world‚Äù information.A Microsoft Access database was developed to store entity descriptions.  The schema for the database was based on the identified fields in the DoD‚Äôs Data Standardization Procedures [9] for representing metadata.The hundreds of entities listed in the database needed to be grouped into categories to simplify the comparison of the various representations.  The selection of the categories (and some subcategories) was somewhat arbitrary.  However, the categories only simplify comparison and presentation of similar concepts across multiple systems. Once categories and subcategories were defined, entities were allocated to the categories in the database.Legacy systems were ranked by relevance to the HLA DSB Objectives.  The following relevance categories (in order of decreasing relevance) were identified:Constructive Simulation Object Models and/or File Formats,Non-constructive Object Models and/or File Formats,Simulation related Object Models and/or File Formats, andNon-simulation Object Models and/or File Formats.Upon review of the database of legacy data model entities, categories were established for grouping purposes.  These ‚Äúbins‚Äù were somewhat arbitrary and were not meant to suggest the structure of the next phase‚Äôs logical object model.The groups identified were:Metadata,Environment,Category,Unassigned,Metadata,Environment,Organization,Simulation Object,Information Item, andEvents.A final category, ‚ÄúOut of Scope‚Äù was added to categorize legacy data model entities that did not fall within the scope of our scenario definition.2.2 Data ModelA strawman logical data model was developed to describe the scenario standard.  The data model is intended to be a first description that will evolve as research continues.The challenge is to develop a data model that will support many disparate simulations but is still extremely flexible in providing coverage for all legacy elements while providing some useful structure.  At one extreme, the data model could be a compilation of all legacy systems that require updates everytime a new simulation is developed.  Alternatively, at the other extreme the data model could be a ‚Äúmetamodel‚Äù that approached the simplicity of a Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tool model which simply identified the existance of entities and attributes.A compromise approach was taken that provides some common scenario concepts as organizing principles, but includes the concept of ‚ÄúProperty‚Äù classes which associate any type of value with a scenario component.The development of the data model began with an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).  The ERD borrowed heavily from the categories identified in the legacy data analysis.The ERD was then evolved into an IDEF1X data model diagram (see figure 2).  IDEF1X is the preferred language for representing data models [10].A data dictionary was developed which details the entities and attributes of the data model.To verify the ‚Äúcoverage‚Äù of the data model, a mapping was created to ensure that all the legacy scenario data model entities could be assigned to an entity in the HLA DSB data model.2.3 XML Data Interchange FormatXML was selected as the method for describing the data interchange for the scenario data.  XML is a metalanguage ‚Äì a language for describing languages [11].  XML languages use markup similar to HTML.XML and its ‚Äúparent‚Äù SGML have been recommended for interchanging simulation data [7] and for maintaining metadata for HLA-related repositories [12].An XML format is described in a Document Type Description (DTD).   An XML DTD for scenarios has been developed based on the data model described above.  An example of a portion of data represented according to the DTD is provided in figure 3.The advantages of XML representation is the ability to leverage off-the-shelf XML-enabled applications and code libraries.3. Future DirectionsThe standards developed under the current HLA DSB effort can be used in new applications.  Figure 4 displays an operational concept of HLA DSB related tools and data.A training objective tool can be used to specify federation objectives.  These tools help focus training federations on the ‚Äútasks to be trained‚Äù.  An example of one such tool is USACOM‚Äôs Joint Exercise Management Program (JEMP) [13].  Objectives are used by a scenario developer.  Because the HLA DSB DIF is based on XML, we envision users accessing data from repositories over the Internet or SIPRNET.  4. SummarySharing HLA scenarios provides many benefits to federation developers and their sponsors.  The vision of the HLA DSB effort is to improve the timeliness, quality, and cost-effectiveness of developing HLA scenarios (and associated tools) by standardizing the interchange of scenario data.Recent HLA DSB efforts have resulted in a Legacy Scenario Data Analysis, a Strawman Scenario Logical Data Model, and a draft XML DTD for HLA scenarios.  These efforts help initiate standardization efforts to support the entire HLA community.5.
