Synthetic Mission Space (SMS)(Start Up) Forum SessionDistributed Simulation Development TrackChairPhil Zimmerman /Tony CerriVice ChairRick SeveringhausSecretary(acting) Rick SeveringhausObjectives for this Workshop:Generate dialogue on the concept that there is value in discussing the many mechanisms/approaches/methods possible to create useful, extensible Synthetic Mission Spaces. The basic idea for the Forum was to explore overlaps, differences, and similarities between and among various "composable environments" (such as in  MC02, JSB, JVB, etc.) For this Workshop, the specific area identified for discussion was Federation Agreements.Presentation of papers relevant to the development of Synthetic Mission Spaces to spur interactive discussion.Explore community interest in developing and maintaining this Forum to address methods to address simulation composability and development of synthetic mission spaces.Identify leaders for the Forum. For the near future:Co-Chairs – Phil Zimmerman, Tony CerriVice Chair – Rick SeveringhausSecretary – (acting)  Rick SeveringhausIdentify topics and themes for exploration next SIW. Comments and Recommendations:Federations have been put together in ways not expected, and in ways beyond what was envisioned by DMSO when HLA formalisms were first developed and migrated to IEEE standards. Individual federations provide a “synthetic mission space” of an extent sufficient to support the objectives of that federation, but there is no community wide process for “connecting” federations, without significant rework or new effort, to provide an expanded “synthetic mission space” able to serve connected Federations.  Nor are there in existence guidelines by which practitioners can leverage existing efforts to expand and enhance existing “synthetic mission spaces” already built to serve a specified need.There are in current community practice no informal “rules of order” or “best practices” to lead practitioners towards convergence of intent and implementation when faced with the problem of getting 2 or more existing federations to work together.An argument can be made that all the discussion, exchange of information, etc., that occurs during development of a set of SOMs and/or FOMs constitute de facto a set of “federation agreements” among interested parties. These informal agreements provide implementation details and/or guidelines required by programmers and others to come to convergence on what is necessary to complete a FOM/SOM development effort. In this sense, such ‘federation agreements’ are a “programmer’s guide” to the process. There was general agreement that there is value in exploring an effort to put more “structure” into the area of Federation Agreements. In current community practice, there appears to be informal support for this, but there is no established process for enabling reuse and/or extension of developed Federation Agreements.From the presentation of the six papers and dialogue during the Panel session, one thread of discussion centered on the idea of developing “checklists” to assist practitioners in developing Federation Agreements.  Participants agreed that no “universal checklist” now exists, and that effort is needed to investigate the practicality of developing a generic checklist of value to the community, and a process/method for implementing its use (e.g., perhaps via web or browser based technology). The general idea is to find a way to formalize in a sensible way the practices mentioned in 3. above. Based on the extensive discussions during the session, the Forum recommends exploring a proposal from the audience to form a group to look in some detail at Federation Agreements as a method facilitating simulation composability.There was general agreement that the focus of this Forum is distinct enough to be continued, and to be pursued as a venue separate from other existing SIW forums.Recommendations for future themes and/or main topics for the Spring 04 SIW were solicited. Offers to submit suggestions for reflector discussion were made by those in attendance.  Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)22Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)43Peak attendance (including joint sessions)NATotal papers presented6Other presentations and panel discussions          Panel Topic - Federation Agreements6Recommended Reading List nominations (including previous nominations):As a start up Forum, there are no nominations for this Workshop.
