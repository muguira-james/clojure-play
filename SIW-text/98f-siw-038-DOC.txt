The Situational Awareness Tactical Internet Data Server (SATIDS) was developed jointly by  PM Combat Identification and STRICOM to support the Virtual Integration Exercise (VIE) for two purposes. First, SATIIDS linked Applique/FBCB2 to simulations by taking DIS information and converting to Variable Message Format (VMF) messages subsequently allowing FBCB2s to communicate situational awareness information about all members of an exercise (both virtual devices and Semi Automated Forces). The second purpose for SATIDS was  to model the delays associated with the tactical internet as a result of the message traffic load among all systems (both voice and data) during a battle. These delays were modeled stochastically and emulated the effects of all members of a particular net by simulating Appliqués for all applicable systems. SATIDS makes use of a modular architecture utilizing SAF libraries and a government provided VMF parser. This architecture allows for seamless upgrades as C4I systems and simulations evolve. SATIDS has been integrated into the Fort Hood SIMNET facility to support troop training. Additional plans call for SATIDS to facilitate integration of all Army Tactical Command and Control Systems (ATCCS) with simulations as well as expanding the modeling of the communications net loading to include dynamic loading.						1  INTRODUCTIONThe integration of real world systems with simulations for both the training and analytical domains has been developed and explored extensively during the past several years. STRICOM, through the Advanced Distributed Simulation Technology II (ADST II) program supported by SAIC, has lead the integration of Applique and subsequently FBCB2 with virtual and constructive simulations and their interface with C4I systems. The Force Protection Experiment III (FPE III) linked Appliqué with manned simulators and ModSAF through the ADST II developed Applique Interface utilizing the Tactical Internet Model (TIM) and Internet Controller (INC) model. This experiment demonstrated the role applique played in increasing the situational awareness for the soldier. The Applique Interface converted DIS entity state Protocol Data Units (PDU) into VMF tactical messages to provide the SA picture. The messages were transmitted via ethernet connection and assumed perfect communications between ModSAF Appliqués at echelons of platoon and below.  The TIM provided realistic communications at the Company level, and within the manned Platoon.  For the Company-level FPE III experiment, the assumption of perfect communications between members of the same platoon was considered valid.The Virtual Integration Exercise, sponsored by PM Combat Identification, focused on a joint combined arms exercise for a Cavalry squadron conducting screening operations, supported by USAF F-16 aircraft. The exercise was based at the Mounted Warfare Test Bed, Fort Knox KY, and included the F-16 simulators from the Human Research Lab, Mesa AZ, and Army Aviation assets from the Aviation Test Bed at Fort Rucker AL. Applique again provided situational awareness data to the soldier. However, due to the front covered by a cavalry squadron the assumption of perfect communications was no longer valid. As a result of the need to model the delays over the SINCGARS and EPLRS radio network, the Appliqué Interface evolved into the Situational Awareness Tactical Internet Data Server (SATIDS). SATIDS incorporated the functionality of the TIM and INC while also modeling the delays of the tactical internet and incorporating new delays due to SIP and SIP+ air-to-ground interrogations. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the integration of simulations and C4I systems by presenting a generic architecture reviewing the implementation of the approach as the SATIDS, and discussing future improvements to SATIDSFigure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 1 Digital BattlefieldC4I SystemsC4I systems provide the commander and staff with the ability to plan and execute orders rapidly over time and space. Figure 1 depicts a version of the desired end state for the C4I architecture. This is a system of C4I systems with interoperability requirements across multiple platforms and levels of command. The All Source Analysis System (ASAS) in figure 1 has the requirement to interoperate from the individual soldier potentially through a JSTARS aircraft.The ASAS must also be able to communicate with other ASAS systems representing units to the left, right, above and below on the battlefield. During an actual conflict or perhaps a major exercise, these systems all would be operational. However, to train the soldier, staff, or commander or provide an experimental proving ground for development of new concepts, it would be infeasible to field all of the possible system of C4I systems. The problem becomes one of how to provide this environment in a cost-effective manner without compromising the training or experiment.These C4I systems can be stimulated by simulations (such as ModSAF, Eagle, and Janus). Information from the simulation environment can be captured and converted into a message format compatible with the C4I system. Many simulation exercises however do not represent all of the potential C4I systems that a typical commander or staff could interact with during a mission. To provide a realistic environment, the command and control of functions of the adjacent, higher and lower units should be modeled. These units are typically represented in Semi Automated Forces or some form of entity based simulation. Typically one level up, down, right and left would be appropriate for representing the command and control structure. For example, if a battalion staff was conducting a training exercise, the lower companies, adjacent battalions, and higher brigade headquarters should be represented. However, resources both fiscal and personal, generally restrict the ability of the trainers to represent all these varying units with their corresponding C4I system. A potential solution to this problem is the development of a system that can serve as a gateway between C4I systems and simulations while also simulating the C4I capabilities of the Semi-Automated forces.Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 2 Functionally Simulating C4I SystemsPROPOSED GENERIC APPROACH Connectivity between simulation systems and real world C4I systems has been demonstrated by many different methods. Gateways such as the Tactical Simulation Interface Unit (TSIU) and the Modular Reconfigurable C4I Interface (MRCI) have connected various C4I systems with simulations in both the Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) and High Level Architecture environments (HLA). These systems have enabled the passing of messages from the simulation to the C4I systems in standard message formats (VMF and JVMF, etc.). These gateways have provided the ability to train a staff using their native C4I systems. Representing the C4I capabilities of the SAF forces requires a concept of simulating the command and control system for each entity having the capability of participating in the C4I network. At the lowest level of simulation, this could mean representing an FBCB2 device. At a high level, it could mean simulating the MCS device for a particular brigade. Regardless of the level of command of the system, each has a similar functionality. The C4I system would have the ability to send and receive messages from other units within its domain or command. Each C4I capable SAF entity must also have this ability if the C4I network is to be accurately modeled. Figure 2 depicts the functional requirements that an integrated C4I simulation environment must satisfy. The left side of the figure depicts a hypothetical battalion level MCS that would be typically manned in the Tactical Operations Center (TOC). This system is the objective of interest for training. This MCS would receive situational awareness (SA) and command and control (C2) data from lower level FBCB2 devices, adjacent unit MCS systems, and brigade level MCS. In the C4I-Simulation representation, the MCS of interest would communicate with simulations from above and below representing the supporting C4I systems. A capability must exist that can stimulate the remaining C4I systems.A gateway between the simulation and the C4I systems can provide the ability to surrogate the C4I systems depicted by the entities.  Figure 3 depicts an object oriented open architecture for a gateway between the C4I systems and the simulations. Each C4I capable entity is represented as a C4I object or node. This node takes on the role as the C4I surrogate for the entity. The route node understands the real world C4I architecture and handles all routing of messages for the C4I nodes. The Comm node models the delays associated with the C4I architecture. Each C4I system, both real and simulated have a corresponding C4I node. The characteristics of the node simulate the  basic operations of the C4I device.  Each node provides simple functionality to provide the correct inputs and outputs of a real C4I device without the added expense of having that device in the exercise.  Some examples would be modeling the promotion and demotion of FBCB2 servers, proper SA position reports due to time and movement, as well as destruction of the device.Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 3 C4I-Simulation Gateway ArchitectureThis open architecture provides a robust environment for simulating C4I entities while also serving as a gateway for stimulating C4I systems with information generated in the simulation environment. Any number of C4I nodes could be generated for varying scenarios. Additional effects nodes could easily be created as the understanding of the C4I simulation requirements grow. The Comm and Route node can be modified as the C4I architecture matures. An implementation of this open architecture has been demonstrated in the Situational Awareness Tactical Internet Data Server (SATIDS).SATIDS IMPLEMENTATION AND DEVELOPMENTThe Situational Awareness Tactical Internet Data Server was created to support the Virtual Integration Exercise. The particular requirements for this exercise were to provide the positions of SAF and manned virtual entities on the Applique device and realistically model the delays and dropped messages associated with the Tactical Internet. A total of 10 manned vehicle simulators were outfitted with Applique version 1.02A. These vehicles portrayed varying roles on the battlefield ranging from wingman to company commander. Three Appliques were also installed in a Tactical Operations Center (TOC) to provide the squadron commander with a command and control capability. All Appliqués were configured utilizing the supplied address book.The tactical internet for the exercise was modeled as a division cavalry squadron network over an area normally associated with a reconnaissance mission. ModSAF version 3.0 was used to round out the members of each troop, playing roles from wingman through troop commander. CECOM provided routing tables for the C4I architecture and the associated communications delays for each segment of the tactical internet. SATIDS provided situational awareness data to each Appliqué. Each simulated entity, virtual and SAF, was represented as a node within SATIDS. SATIDS, running on a dual ethernet SUN Ultra Sparc, received entity state information from the DIS network depicting the location or situational awareness for each member of the Tactical Internet.  The communications and routing nodes simulated the effects of the tactical internet. Each node then generated a Variable Message Format (VMF) message which was then routed to the appropriate appliqué.  Figure 4 depicts the situational awareness network used for the Virtual Integration Exercise.After the Virtual Integration Exercise, the SATIDS was updated to interface with newer FBCB2 software.  This upgrade was accomplished to support the FBCB2 Limited User Test (LUT) training needs at the Fort Hood SIMNET facility.  The addition of SATIDS to this facility allows the troops to train at platoon and company levels and now see a more complete SA picture.  SATIDS interfaces with the FBCB2 2.1.1 and 2.1a versions.Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 4 VIE SA NetworkFUTURE DEVELOPMENTSATIDS continues to be developed and improved under the direction of STRICOM in the ADST II Simulation C4I laboratory. Current ongoing enhancements include increasing the C2 messaging capability for various formats, full integration with all ATCCS systems, increased interoperability with SAF, movement to HLA compatibility and the development of a streamlined graphical user interface for easy implementation. The integration of C4I systems with simulation systems continues to be an evolving problem. Gateway solutions provide an immediate answer to the problem. Long term solutions most likely involve changes to simulations design with C4I systems able to adapt to simulation networks. Work needs to be performed in the area of developing intelligent simulations able to receive messages from C4I systems and respond as a commander. JSIMS and its family of simulations provides an opportunity for solving many of these issues.REFERENCESADST II CDRL VIE 9800030 1998, Version Description Document, Situational Awareness Tactical Internet Data Server.ADST II CDRL VIE 9800031 1998, Final Report, Virtual Integration Exercise.ADST II CDRL 018R 9600438 1997, Version Description Document, FPEIII Appliqué Interface.Brennan, J.M., 1998 “The Army Experiment 4 Simulation to Army Battle Command System Experiments”, Paper 98S-SIW-002, 1998 Spring Simulation Interoperability Workshop.Carr, F.H. and Roberts,J.D., 1998, “Mitre Appliqué Interface: Closing the Gap Between Battlefield C4I Systems and Simulations”, Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Computer Generated Forces and Behavioral Representation..Department of the Army 1993.
