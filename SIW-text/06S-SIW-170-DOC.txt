Name of Forum or Group:  Training ForumChairScott JohnstonVice ChairGarry MorissetteSecretaryMichael WoodmanObjectives for this Workshop:Provide an interface between User requirements and standards development.Provide a forum for Users to describe M&S interoperability shortfalls.Provide a linkage between the User and the Technical Communities.4.	Provide a forum for the Technical Community to present potential solutions to Users.Comments and Recommendations:Several of the authors presented contemporary issues regarding simulation interoperability but few solutions were exhibited. Many user organizations are looking to SISO to provide guidance. Two presenters, 06S-SIW-076 Interaction of Human Behaviour Models and 06S-SIW-052 The Silent Battlefield – Let Voices be Heard and Shots Ring Out! recommended SISO Study Groups. Similarly, 06S-SIW-053 C4I and ISTAR Interoperability Issues within the UK’s Proposed Network Enabled Training Capability identified challenges but is “looking for SISO to help with solutions.”When a room is divided into two (e.g., 1a and 1b), the CC needs to ensure that turning off the lights in one section does not affect the lights in the other.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)31Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)34Peak attendance (including joint sessions)70Total papers presented12“No-show” presentations1Other presentations and panel discussions0Recommended Reading List nomination: 06S-SIW-121 Improving Unity of Effort in Command and Control Processes: An Operational Analysis of a Joint Doctrinal Language06S-SIW-128 Rapid Generation of Simulation Scenario Context                 2006 SPRING SIW OUTBRIEF FORM
