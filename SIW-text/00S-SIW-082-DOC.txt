As such, DIA, together with DMSO to facilitate this MSEA(I) role, has sponsored the development of the Classified Modeling and Simulation (M&S) Resource Repository (CMSRR). Initial CMSRR efforts have focused upon describing relevant US ISR and FORREP data resources.The purpose of this paper is to describe the results of an ongoing effort to identify the US ISR and FORREP needs of the greater DoD M&S community, as well as to develop a more robust catalogue of currently available resources. Such resources will span the spectrum of data, tools and models. The comparison of these two end products will help the MSEA(I) better identify opportunities to support the greater DoD M&S community. This effort will aid interoperability and reuse across DoD M&S activities by shortening the time needed to acquire such resources.1.  Background1.1  Stand-up of DIMSOIn 1991, the Deputy Secretary of Defense assigned overall management responsibility of all DoD modeling and simulation (M&S) to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology.  In October 1995, the USD (A&T) signed the DoD’s Modeling and Simulation Master Plan.  This instructed the Director, Defense Intelligence Agency, to coordinate intelligence related support of this plan with the US Intelligence Community.Concurrently, in the fall of 1995, the Military Intelligence Board (MIB) determined that it was essential for Defense Intelligence to participate in the DoD M&S revolution. The determination was prompted largely due to two M&S intelligence requirements placed  before the MIB by the Unified Commands:The need for more authoritative representations of foreign forces  rather than accepting that they would simply mirror US forces.  There was a call for a standardized, automated foreign military capabilities database available to rapidly develop exercise scenarios and derivative databases for use in automated simulations. The stated goal, using automation tools, was to create an exercise database for any given geographic region or threat within 96 hours of notice.The need to improve our ability to train intelligence personnel and reduce exercise support requirements by developing an endtoend model or representation of the U.S. national,  joint and component intelligence processes to provide realistic training for our intelligence personnel and as a centerpiece for exercise command and control (C2). As a result of the MIB’s decisions and in conjunction with USD (A&T) and the Joint Simulation System (JSIMS) Joint Program Office (JPO), the following occurred:in February 1996 the DIA was designated as the JSIMS Intelligence Executive Agent (EA)simultaneously DIA was designated as a JSIMS Development Agent (DA) for US intelligence functionalityand in July 1996, DIA received the additional designation as the DoD M&S Executive Agent  for Intelligence (MSEA(I)).  In these various roles, DIA is responsible for providing or coordinating and integrating authoritative representations of  US intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) systems and processes, as well as supporting authoritative representation of all aspects of foreign forces (FORREP), to include systems, processes, entities, and behavior  (not just Foreign ISR).Within DIA, a Defense Intelligence Modeling and Simulation Office (DIMSO) was established to support and coordinate these various DoD M&S missions.  The DIA MSEA(I) role is reaffirmed in the new DoD M&S Master Plan, DoD 5000.59P, which is currently under revision by the Defense Modeling and Simulation Office (DMSO).  In this new version currently available from the web pages of the Modeling and Simulation Information Analysis Center (MSIAC) Special Interest Area on the DoD M&S Master Plan  (Version MPv01_99_08_16,  Initial Draft, Aug 99),  it first states in Chapter 1, "General Information," on pages 6-7 that the role of an MSEA is as follows:"Modeling and Simulation Executive Agents (MSEA)  DoDD 5000.59 defines an MSEA as a DoD Component to whom the USD(A&T) assigns management responsibility and delegates authority for the development and maintenance of a specific area of M&S application, including relevant standards and databases, used by or common to many models and simulations.  There are currently four active MSEAs assigned by USD(A&T)."Regarding DIA's role as the MSEA for Intelligence, later on page 7 this plan states the following:"Intelligence.  The DoD MSEA for representations of foreign forces and US national and joint intelligence processes is The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA).  DIA established the DoD center of excellence for M&S information, coordination, and expertise on foreign forces, systems, behaviors, and US national and joint intelligence processes.  They also established the Defense Intelligence M&S Office (DIMSO) to serve as a focal point to interact with other DoD-level M&S organizations on DoD MSEA-related issues."1.2  Status of  DIMSO activitiesTogether, the roles of DIA as the JSIMS Intelligence EA and as the DoD MSEA(I) are diverse and complex.  In the slightly more than three years since these designations, DIA has taken steps to move forward in both of these roles.  Still, in the sense of an overall maturity life cycle analogy of "Crawl, Walk, Run," it is clear that DIMSO is still in the "Crawl" stages, and much remains to be done.In support of the JSIMS Intelligence EA role: DIMSO previously led an effort to collect and compile JSIMS intelligence requirements from the Unified Commands and military services. DIMSO is currently in the process of developing a methodology to assess the degree of satisfaction of these requirements (via Measures of Performance and Measures of Effectiveness).DIMSO has sponsored the development of a Conceptual Model of the Mission Space (CMMS), referred to as the Defense Intelligence Mission Area Model (DIMAM).  This effort has resulted in the generation of numerous Formalized Data Products (FDPs) relative to US national and theater-level intelligence organization, systems and processes.  (Note: FDPs are a JSIMS-sanctioned, text-based format for capturing CMMS data).  Although developed with the JSIMS program as the customer, it is hoped that DIMAM FDPs will be of value to the greater DoD M&S community and help DIMSO to move out in its MSEA(I) role.DIMSO has sponsored research leading to development of approaches for the incorporation of the following capabilities of opposing forces:Foreign Fire Support and Ground ArtilleryForeign Integrated Air DefensesForeign ISR.In support of the JSIMS Intelligence DA role:DIMSO has sponsored the development of the DOMINO (Defense Object-oriented Model of Intelligence Operations) software model.  The objective of this program is to begin to automate the production of many of the various intelligence products (human intelligence (HUMINT), Measures and Signatures Intelligence (MASINT), Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), etc.).In support of the MSEA(I) role:DIMSO establishes the M&S vision, goals, objectives, and strategy for the Defense Intelligence Community, and is leading an effort to develop a DoD Intelligence M&S Master Plan..DIMSO has initiated efforts to provide or coordinate the provision of authoritative representation of the intelligence domain, including intelligence processes and foreign representations.DIMSO works with the Defense Intelligence Producers’ Council to ensure threat models, threat databases, and other data are produced in accordance with DoD standards and are available to all services, the National Reconnaissance Office, the National Security Agency, the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, and Joint and Unified Commands.Also, in support of the MSEA(I) role, together with DMSO:DIMSO has sponsored the development of the Unit Order of Battle (UOB) Data Interchange Format (DIF) and Access Tool.  And perhaps the last significant activity, but the most relevant to this paper, DIMSO has sponsored the development of the DIA Modeling and  Simulation Resource Repository (MSRR) Node.  This project provides both an unclassified node available via the public Internet (URL:  HYPERLINK http://199.75.73.39 http://199.75.73.39) as well as a classified node with greater access to information via the US DoD  SIPRnet (URL: http:// 206.36.142.198).  The goals of this project are as follows:Provide automated access to and retrieval of authoritative threat and blue intelligence information and resources Serve as the gateway to authoritative threat and blue intelligence information producersProvide a coherent means of distributing threat and blue intelligence information and resources to the M&S user community.It is fair to state that the preponderance of DIMSO's attention these first few years has been on the first two roles listed above, both of which focus on support to the JSIMS program.  This is understandable as this has been a program with an urgent and fairly well-articulated need for DIMSO's services.  Even still, there is still much more that needs to be done in these two JSIMS-related roles, as, for example, the portrayal of opposing forces capabilities within JSIMS lacks any cohesive plan or oversight.In terms of the last of these above roles, the MSEA(I) role, DIMSO has only begun to scratch the surface of what it could be doing to support the greater DoD M&S community.  This is in part due to the fact that DIMSO has initially focused most of its attention on JSIMS, and has only recently begun to endorse activities such as the UOB Access Tool and the DIA MSRR.  This state of affairs is perhaps even more attributable to a "chicken and egg" situation:There have been few organizations across the greater DoD M&S community that have expressed a need for US ISR or FORREP support of any kind.Without such needs being articulated, DIMSO has no clear mandate as to what activities to support, and must take educated guesses at endorsing activities that it believes will be of value.This paper is an initial step of a larger effort to resolve this "chicken and egg" situation.  DIMSO hopes that providing wider knowledge of available intelligence resources will facilitate discussions with the greater DoD M&S community as to what their respective needs may be, thereby helping to shape the MSEA(I) program.2.  DoD M&S Status of US ISR & FORREP 2.1  US ISR:  Increasingly Recognized as EssentialIn the operational world of the Warfighter, the means by which US forces perceive the current status of the battlespace is critically dependent upon successful collection of various forms of intelligence, and then the timely and accurate processing, exploitation, production and dissemination of this information to Warfighters and decision makers.  In a simulated context, the degree of fidelity and resolution to which any particular simulation represents these real-world intelligence systems and processes is a function of the specific requirements of the respective program.  Some simulation programs may require great levels of detailed representation of US ISR systems and processes; others may aggregate overall capabilities with a few simplifying assumptions.From an initial cursory review of the DoD M&S community, with particular emphasis on the JSIMS and Joint Warfare System (JWARS) programs, there seems to be well articulated requirements as to the US ISR capabilities of respective programs.  To address such requirements, it is initially hoped that the greater DoD M&S community will be able to leverage many of the US ISR products developed for the JSIMS program.  Still, beyond the JSIMS and JWARS programs, DIMSO has yet to ascertain the US ISR needs of this greater DoD M&S community.FORREP: The status quo From a similar cursory review of the DoD M&S community, again with particular emphasis on the JSIMS and JWARS programs, it is clear that little has changed in the last few years regarding the first of the FORREP deficiencies articulated by the Unified Commands and endorsed by the MIB several years ago (mentioned above).  This deficiency is:The need for more authoritative representations of foreign forces  rather than accepting that they would simply mirror US forces.For example, both the JSIMS and JWARS programs plan, for the most part, to represent the majority of aspects of opposing forces by reusing the same software designed and developed to represent US forces.  To reflect differences in opposing force nations' capabilities, they will simply attempt to obtain unique input data that may characterize the respective nation's capabilities.There are increasing levels of concern across the M&S community about the validity of representing opposing forces by simply taking "Blue" forces and coloring them "Red."  This may have had some degree of validity when our opposing force nation in many simulation activities was the monolithic Warsaw Pact.  But, given our increased need to consider scenarios such as Lesser Regional Contingencies (LRCs), Crisis and Operations Other Than War (OOTW), the opposing force nations being simulated are frequently far less capable than our own.  Accordingly, the processes by which they execute their various operations are typically vastly different than our own.Therefore, it may be difficult if not impossible to represent the various military operations of a foreign nation by using the same software developed for US operations and supplying different input data.  For example, paper 99F-SIW-128, "OPFOR Perception of the Battlespace (OPB): Challenges for Intelligence Community Support to Military Training Simulations," presented at the last SIW, discussed the vastly different challenges in a military training scenario of developing an opposing force perception of the battlespace as opposed to providing the Blue training audience a perception of the battlespace.As with representation of US ISR systems and processes, the degree of fidelity and resolution to which any particular simulation represents opposing forces, or FORREP, systems and processes is a function of the requirements of each respective simulation program.  Taking "Blue" forces and coloring them "Red" may be sufficient for some programs, depending on the opposing force nation under consideration, as well as the specific issues which the simulation is being used to address.  For other applications, this may be an approach that potentially yields invalid results, in turn leading to inaccurate analytic conclusions, or perhaps misleading or negative training.What seems clear from this current situation is that there is an increased recognition that this approach of taking "Blue" and coloring it "Red" will not suffice in the future.  Still, it is difficult for DIMSO to sponsor programs to address FORREP without a clearer mandate emerging from the greater DoD M&S community as to what that community's needs may be. 3.  Ongoing MSEA(I) Research ActivitiesAs mentioned above at the end of section 1., in support of the broader MSEA(I) role, this section provides a summary of DIMSO research to date regarding available US ISR and FORREP resources.  Looking beyond the resources currently planned for incorporation into the DIA MSRR nodes, this research has begun to identify the broader spectrum of US ISR and FORREP data, tools and models that exist across the US DoD and Intelligence communities.  The initial focus of this research has been on resources held by three of the U.S. Intelligence Production Centers (IPCs), as follows: the Missiles and Space Intelligence Center (MSIC)the National Ground Intelligence Center (NGIC)and the National Air Intelligence Center (NAIC).Note:  Most of the following information pertains to the first two IPCs.  We have only begun to uncover resources available from the third IPC, NAIC.  As of the drafting of this paper, the sole NAIC resource discovered is the Finished Intelligence Database.  The following presents the results of our research to date.  We are exploring easier ways to display it, as well as database structures  to facilitate search and discovery of its contents.  For now, we present a simple outline listing of resources discovered.  Some of these items were found using the DMSO-sponsored ADS (Authoritative Data Sources);  others were found by accessing information available directly form the sponsoring organization.  In each case, we attempt to provide the following:Differentiation between being a US ISR resource vice a FORREP resourceDifferentiation between the resource being a database, tool or softwareA brief descriptionInformation on how to get more details and access to the resource. Findings are listed below, with the following caveat: Assessments as to whether an item falls into the category of FORREP, US ISR or both are just that, assessments;

The future role of the MSEA(I)From the above, it should be readily apparent that there exists a vast amount of US ISR and FORREP resources that could be made more readily available to the greater DoD M&S community.  To make any progress in this MSEA(I) role and advance beyond the aforementioned "chicken and the egg" dilemma, though, it is essential that more proactive steps are taken.  The following steps have been identified, of which this current report provides the foundation for the first.  Much more work remains to be done for us to be able to declare "success" in this MSEA(I) role.Need for the MSEA(I) to more proactively market/ advertise/communicate to the greater DoD M&S community what resources are currently availableNeed for the MSEA(I) to solicit from this broad DoD M&S community what their particular US ISR and FORREP needs currently are as well as, perhaps, emerging needs for the futureNeed for the MSEA(I) to factor this information into its plans:What current resources are in high demand and should be made readily availableDecide what new resources (e.g., data, data manipulation tools, data access tools, software modules) are needed by the community and develop community relationships to share in the sponsorship of such developments.5.  ConclusionsMany current DoD M&S programs could likely benefit from authoritative US ISR and FORREP resources.  Few programs, though, seem to be seeking such resources, and for those that do, information is difficult to acquire.The MSEA(I) is continuing to mature as an organization and would like to better understand how it can support the greater DoD M&S community, but in the absence of any great demand, it is difficult to define precisely where and how to begin.As an initial step to resolve this situation, this  paper provides a glimpse into the vast wealth of information related to US ISR and FORREP resources that has already been collected and either is available today, or could be made readily available if so desired.In the future, the MSEA(I) is planning to be more aggressive in both communicating what is available while concurrently soliciting your feedback as to what the needs of the greater DoD M&S community may be.  This will help to shape the MSEA(I) program of the future.  Furthermore, the successful definition and implementation of this MSEA(I) role will aid interoperability and reuse across DoD M&S activities by shortening the time needed to acquire such needed US ISR and FORREP resources.6.
