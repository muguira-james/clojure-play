The panel was well-received with over 40 in attendance. Although the discussion “officially” ended at 1700, the discussion was very probing, and there were still 25 people intensely engaged at 1730. One participant remarked that it is amazing how much emotion this issue provokes.Please note that I was unable to comment fully on the joint session with DSPT (I was scheduled to deliver a paper in a different session at the same time). Please refer to Jake Borah’s DSPT Outbrief for any comments on the joint session.Because of the late cancellation of the last paper in the joint session, there was an open timeslot. Jeff Steinman kindly provided an impromptu presentation on “The Fifth Dimension”, which is a radical new approach in the application of optimistic simulation that has the potential to greatly reduce the time taken to complete a series of Monte Carlo simulations. This is very exciting, and the proliferation of multicore machines has the potential to make the approach more practical for a wider audience.Attendance: 9:00 – 9, 9:30 – 15, 10:00 – 34, 11:00 – 25, 11:30 – 31, Joint Session (perhaps Jake has numbers?)16:00 – 40, 16:30 – 40+ (I was a panelist and it was hard to keep track of exact numbers)Comments and Recommendations:The “wrap up discussion” was scheduled for 1700; however, the Open Source Panel Discussion totally over-ran this opportunity.Recommendations:1.23Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)28Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)40+Peak attendance (including joint sessions)Jake/DSPT?Total papers presented9 + JS impromptu“No-show” presentations0Other presentations and panel discussions2Recommended Reading List nomination: As before                 2007 FALL SIW OUTBRIEF FORM
