U.S. military personnel have been deployed throughout the world and are operating at a very high tempo that impacts the ability of the military services to effectively educate and train them.  ADL is being developed as a standard to guide the development of World Wide Web based learning technologies.  The two major components specified for ADL are the Sharable Courseware Object Reference Model (SCORM), an extensible Markup Language (XML) based model, and the Learning Management System (LMS).  The SCORM is an application independent specification that will provide the basis for describing the structure and content of both training courses and embedded lessons. LMSs will manage SCORM compliant training courses in a client/server relationship, and be capable of providing a variety of services for the training service provider as well as the learner.  The Defense Modeling and Simulation Office (DMSO) has recognized the value of ADL, and is pursuing its use to inform the Department of Defense (DoD) Modeling and Simulation (M&S) community about the High Level Architecture (HLA) training program.  DMSO has funded a nine-month project to review and transform available HLA training materials to SCORM-compliant modules. The HLA program, through this project, has become an early adopter of the ADL initiative, and has gained valuable technological insights that can be shared with the DoD M&S community.  This paper updates the results of the project’s hands-on experience accrued from converting legacy presentations to SCORM compliant content.  This paper presents the transformation process employed to move selected essential course elements from the existing legacy presentations into more interactive web-based delivery formats.  IntroductionToday, since the HLA has matured from an embryonic to a mature technology, DMSO has shifted its resources to address new challenges in DoD modeling and simulation.  Consequently, the funding currently budgeted to support HLA training will be gradually reduced to a level more commensurate with sustainment of a stable technology.  However, as need for training on the HLA has not decreased, a more cost-effective method for the delivery of instruction is required.  The instructional delivery method that holds the promise of providing meaningful cost-benefits to DMSO is the Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) initiative sponsored by the Under Secretary of Defense for Readiness and Training.  DMSO intends to supplant or augment portions of the existing HLA training program by means of ADL web-based technology to provide HLA instruction to whomever requires the training, wherever, and whenever they need it.Several significant challenges have presented themselves as DMSO has moved to accomplish this objective.  The most noteworthy challenge is that ADL is an evolving technology which has drawn upon the legacy work of several other organizations.  The ADL program began in November 1997, and has released version 1.1 of their Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) specification.  As a newly developed technology, the best practices of employing ADL remain to be discovered.  The lack of readily accessible experience in successfully deploying an ADL-conformant training system is an obstacle confronting organizations attempting to convert existing training programs.  This obstacle was recognized early on in our development effort and the risk has been mitigated by the resolution to define a systematic development approach to guide this conversion effort.  This paper is a follow-up to an earlier paper (01S-SIW-063) in which the authors presented the results of the adaptation of the first three HLA Federation Development and Execution Process (FEDEP) steps to constructing an operative SCORM compliant course.  Here we recap the present transformation process employed to move selected essential elements of information from the existing legacy presentations into more interactive web-based delivery formats.  The paper also discusses the effort associated with the integration of content into commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) learning management systems.  Finally, the paper summarizes the development work necessary to create content page shells and to merge these components into an effective web-based presentation.        Transformation of Legacy Content to Web-based Interactive Informational FormatsAs described in the earlier paper, the transformation of legacy content to a web-based interactive format began with the formulation of an information model of the legacy content.  A method was needed to capture the training information of the existing HLA presentations.  In a two-day working group setting, the DMSO project lead and the core development team established the basic format for the information model.  A general-purpose spreadsheet software application was used as the tool to build the model.  A single workbook was selected to be the representation of the complete HLA seminar-training program.  This workbook became the repository for several spreadsheets, each of which represented a single presentation.  The overall concept was that each training presentation contained several individual, yet related, lessons. When assembled together, these lessons provided all the information contained within a training presentation.  For the purpose of this information model, each training presentation was referred to as a “course module”, and each lesson was designated as a “content module”.  A content module was meant to be the atomic level of training content.  Each content module was viewed as being complete and capable of being presented in and of itself.  The rows of the spreadsheet were used to describe data of a single content module.  The columns were used to describe data elements resident within every content module.  The information model was prototyped during the latter part of the working group session.  The overall workbook and spreadsheet structure for the model was judged to be sufficient.  The model was later refined with additional use into the following format.  The columns of the matrix were named, in order, “Content ID”, “Content Module”, “Desired Learning Objective (Rationale)”, “Teaching Points”, “Location”, “Level of Instruction”, and “Presentation Media”.  On each spreadsheet, data was recorded in a row and column matrix.  Figure 2.1 shows an excerpt from one of the spreadsheets of the Information Model.   Figure 2.1 Example Information Model SectionThe “Content ID” was a unique alphanumeric identifier assigned to each content module.  The “Content Module” was a unique name meant to identify each module, and, if possible, concisely describe its training content.  The “Desired Learning Objective” was the single training goal for each content module.  The “Teaching Points” describe the individual points of instruction that were made by the instructors during their presentations to achieve the content module training goal.  The “Location” referenced the place on a server where the content module resided.  The “Level of Instruction” indicated the relative complexity of the training material.  The HLA training presentations are of three differing levels: basic, intermediate, or advanced.  Finally, the “Presentation Media” described the media used to convey the training material.  The existing training program used Microsoft PowerPoint slides accompanied by instructor-spoken narrative.  The slides were composed of a mixture of text and graphics.  Therefore, the “Presentation Media” was described in terms of a combination of text, graphics, and narrative.nformation model had been prototyped and the scope of the training material had been established, the information model was populated with the chosen training presentations.  During this work, the final definitions of the columns were set.  This work was time-consuming and required close collaboration between development team members so that the resultant work was harmonized in terminology and format.  The population of a course module spreadsheet began with the identification of the content modules of each presentation.  A content module could be either a single Microsoft PowerPoint ( slide or multiple slides.  Once the content module had been identified, the desired learning objective needed to be defined.  Next, the teaching points, the level of instruction, and the presentation media were recorded.  Finally, the location of the information was recorded.  The location evolved to become the annotation describing a slide for configuration management purposes.  The full population of the information model built upon the information model prototype thoroughly described the four HLA training presentations set as the primary objective.  These presentations consisted of 101 Microsoft PowerPoint( slides.  The resultant information model contained 57 content modules which were captured in 40 man-hours of labor.The next major step in the conversion of legacy content was the creation of a script based upon the information model.  The script was written by the content subject matter experts to guide the work of the multi-media developers.  The script format was derived from earlier work done in support of a commercial HLA training course using proprietary HLA software tools.   Each script contained an introductory paragraph, which listed the subsections of the course module, and a five-column table as shown in Figure 2.2.  The five-column table listed the Macromedia Flash file identification number for a particular content module, the intended spoken narrative, notes relevant to the content module, the original source PowerPoint presentation slide number, and the content identification number from the information model.  The script visibly provided a verifiable link from the content of the web-based, multi-media files back to the legacy HLA presentations.3. Content Integration with a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Learning Management System (LMS)This project began with the general goal of the employment of a web-based distributed training system in mind and an approximate appreciation of the pathway to success.  A well-designed content delivery system was critical for project success.  As stated earlier, ADL is a new and evolving technology.  Therefore, research into the ADL technology was necessary to gain an overarching systems view of the ADL technology and ongoing developments.  There are two principal parts to an ADL-conformant training system.  One part is the content which will be delivered to any student.  The second part is the web-based delivery system.  The investigation here focused upon documenting the interrelationships and dependencies between the training content and the web-based delivery system.  The former was addressed by the Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) specification.  The latter was addressed by the various implementations of a Learning Management System (LMSs), which are offered by several vendors.  The development team analyzed each version of the SCORM specification and reviewed the available LMSs in order to understand the breadth of potential capabilities as well as the limitations inherent in this technology in its current state.  It was important to have a solid appreciation of both the capabilities and limitations of the technology so as to have an early assessment of what was possible and what was not.  The development team conducted an evaluation of available LMSs employing a process which was described in detail in the earlier paper (01S-SIW-063).  The SABA LMS was selected by the development team as offering the best combination of features and price for this project.  The SABA LMS is offered in two versions.  One version is an “enterprise” application, in which the customer is sold the software and is expected to operate the LMS upon their own computer equipment and networks.  The other version Introduction to HLA ScriptSections:D-O-D M-and-S Strategy and the Evolution of the HLABasic Overview of the HLASupporting Software and ServicesHLA Standardization InitiativesSummaryFlash FileScriptNotesSlide #Content IDITO_00_v*Welcome to this Introduction to the High Level Architecture Training Module.

For this project, the “hosted” version was selected.  The selection of between the different LMS versions was made based upon the anticipated project needs for an affordable system for low volume usage.  Part of the objectives for this project was to demonstrate the utility of the ADL conversion.  The acquisition, operation and maintenance of an “enterprise” LMS was not seen as a wise investment of limited resources.  Once the LMS was selected, the process of integrating the learning content with the LMS began.The content integration was viewed as a high-risk element in the project development.  Early in the project, content integration tests were made when a trial LMS became available.  The Joint ADL CoLaboratory at the University of Central Florida’s Institute for Simulation and Training collaborated in the content integration testing.  They possessed a version of the Avilar LMS that they made available to this project for testing.  The development team created a set of content pages, written in accordance to the SCORM 1.1 specification, that they attempted to launch from within the Avilar LMS.   It took several weeks to successfully launch the content pages due to SCORM specification interpretation and implementation differences.  This testing reaffirmed that content integration was indeed a high-risk element and that LMS vendor support would be very important to a successful project conclusion.  Each LMS implementation is unique to the developing vendor.  While each LMS vendor is seeking to become conformant with the ADL SCORM specifications, and hence share content among multiple LMSs,  there remain aspects of each LMS that are distinctly proprietary.   LMS vendors have chosen an architecture or framework for their application that was selected for reasons known to the vendor.  The development team needed to quickly understand the framework and terminology employed  within the SABA  LMS to successfully integrate the HLA-ADL content.  This has been accomplished through two collaborative Internet work sessions, and several teleconferences with a SABA Internet content specialist.  The approach ultimately developed through these consultations and a couple of prototypes will have the HLA-ADL content offered as four courses, each with a single attachment which will be a link to Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) pages stored on the development team’s File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server.Creation of Content PagesEarly in the development process, the development team had selected Macromedia Dreamweaver as their authoring tool from among several vendor’s products such as MS Toolbook, and Authorware.  This was done primarily due to the availability of the tool, and the prior experience the developers had in using this tool.  This tool was used to create the LMS early integration test content pages.  As the project moved closer to the actual start of content creation, the most serious concern facing the team was capability to deliver content to the learner in a timely and efficient manner.  Previous research into web page design and computer based training systems had shown that there was a significant relationship between the interactive quality of content and the time necessary to present it.  As the content became more interactive with the learner, the time required to deliver the underlying multi-media files grew.  Additionally, it was found that Internet browsers would need to download and install proprietary application “plug-ins” for particular multi-media file formats.  Therefore, the degree of interactivity of the content, based upon the use of multi-media files, became a major concern to the development team.  In order to solve this problem , two determinations needed to made.  One was an expectation of the sophistication of computer equipment used by the learner; the other was the level of interactivity desired from the final product.  The average learner was expected to be using a Pentium Processor computer with a 15 inch SVGA monitor, speakers, and at best a 56 kilobyte per second (kps) modem connection to the Internet.  This definition is based upon research of the latest information available on military computer system blanket purchasing agreements. The level of interactivity determination was achieved through close collaboration with the DMSO HLA program sponsor, and the use of a set of broad definitions of interactivity levels, along with some illustrative examples, and several prototypes.  The initial expectation of the level of interactivity was intentionally set low to accommodate the anticipated ability to deliver content and was raised as more capability was demonstrated.  Another consideration for the content was that it be Section 508 compatible as this was web-based material that the government was procuring after the Section 508 deadline.  The development researched all the available guidance on the application of Section 508 and incorporated salient features into their web page design.  The initial creation of content focused upon solely providing text web pages that were more interactive than the existing legacy PowerPoint slides.  However, one of the program requirements was not to simply be a web-based, PowerPoint slide flipping system.  The DMSO HLA program wanted to have an effective, beneficial impact upon distributed learners.  As the content development was proceeding, additional investigation was made into alternative approaches for preparing interactive web deliverable content files.  Macromedia’s Flash became a candidate application for such files.   A couple of test files were created in Flash and found to be relatively small in size and capable of being rapidly delivered over a 56 kps modem connection.  It was also determined that the current versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Internet browser had native Flash files plug-ins, so additional application downloads would be minimized for the future learners.  Based on this information and after a successful demonstration, Macromedia Flash was chosen as the tool to produce the majority of the content.  A prototype HTML page was created along with a sample Flash file and was shown to the DMSO project lead and IPT members.  Improvements were made in both the appearance and the embedded functionality of the web page based upon their comments.The concept for the content web pages became a HTML based shell that would contain Flash files as depicted in Figure 4.1.  The HTML shell was designed to border the top and left edges of the web page.  It contained selectable icons or “buttons” which would allow the learner to view an overview menu of the current course module, to search a glossary, to view an overview of all the course modules, to obtain help, to navigate to individual content modules, or to exit the system.  The Flash file was presented in the center to right side of the web page.  Once the Flash file began playing, additional function buttons became visible that would enable the learner to start, to pause, to reload a current content module, or to advance to the next content module in sequence. The final activity of the content creation was the actual conversion of the legacy content to the web-based format.  In general, this work went smoothly since the information model was available to guide the work.  However, the complete conversion of the first module did take more time than originally projected.  This occurred for two reasons, the first was that the careful orchestration of a voice track together with animated text effects was a time consuming manual editing process.  The second reason was that extensive web searches were needed to locate new graphics for the module.  Figure 4.1 Example HLA ADL Web Content Page New graphics were embedded into the presentation to assure that this content would be noticeably different from the legacy PowerPoint presentations.  When finished, the new web-based presentations were a significant improvement over the legacy presentations due to use of an engaging multi-media style.  5. Project Completion         As this paper was written the project was approaching completion.  This paper has presented the most important lessons for the general community.  To finish this project, the following work remains to be done.  First, the web-based presentations will be reviewed by a Content IPT to ensure that the proposed web-pages convey the same message contained in the original HLA Training PowerPoint presentations.  Second, a registration scheme will be implemented that will be the initial starting point to access the new HLA ADL material.  Third, the HLA ADL material will be integrated with the current HLA web-based support.  Finally, a public announcement will be made that will “launch” the new HLA ADL material.The HLA ADL development team has been pursuing an aggressive schedule to produce learning content modules and integrate them with a LMS, while mitigating the risks of working with an evolving technology.  The team has learned a great deal about software tools and techniques useful in creating web-based content from legacy material during this project.  An important element for success was the close collaboration between the following teams or individuals: the Project Sponsor, the System Integrator, the Content Subject Matter Experts, the LMS Vendor, and the Oversight Integrated Product Team.  Another significant element was the thorough LMS research that documented product capabilities and limitations prior to the LMS selection decision.  One last element contributing to the project success was the skillful manner in which the development team used their systems engineering process.  They have built a product that will greatly enhance the reach and impact of the HLA program information. The ADL technology has much to offer those military organizations or commercial companies that need to have a cost-effective method to provide training to an active, geographically dispersed audience.  This paper and the previous SIW paper were written to provide useful implementation level guidance to other adopters of the ADL technology. 6. References[1] Philip Dodds, ed.
