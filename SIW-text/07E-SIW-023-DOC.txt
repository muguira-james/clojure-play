This paper discusses the methodologies and approaches employed by the U. S. Army Space & Missile Defense Command (USA SMDC) to create computationally efficient algorithms and representations of space-based entities and the resulting impacts on maneuver force simulation representations.Figure 1.

PolicyAs shown in Figures 1, 2, and 3, space-based capabilities pervade every aspect of commercial and military activities, and the national space policy of the United States establishes specific responsibilities for the Secretary of Defense (SecDef) that translate into modeling and simulation requirements for the Simulation Development Division (SDD) of the Space and Missile Defense Future Warfare Center (FWC).The Secretary of Defense shall:Maintain the capabilities to execute the space support, force enhancement, space control, and force application missions;Establish specific intelligence requirements that can be met by tactical, operational, or national-level intelligence gathering capabilities;Provide space capabilities to support continuous, global strategic and tactical warning as well as multi-layered and integrated missile defenses;Develop capabilities, plans, and options to ensure freedom of action in space, and, if directed, deny such freedom of action to adversaries;Provide, as launch agent for both the defense and intelligence sectors, reliable, affordable, and timely space access for national security purposes;Have responsibility for space situational awareness [1]Capabilities from Space Advances in space operations have greatly enhanced military capabilities over the last 15 years. For example, compare the capabilities of the US forces in the last two Iraqi conflicts. During Operation Desert Storm, the Army deployed only one Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver for each 180 deployed soldiers, but during Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) more than ten percent of the soldiers had GPS technology at their disposal. The proliferation of GPS satellites enabled this leap-ahead in position awareness for US forces. Further, in the first Persian Gulf War, approximately 10% of the munitions were precision-guided; in the latest conflict approximately 68% were precision-guided. Again, the availability of space-based systems provided the means to this end—the proliferation of space systems and the military operator’s exploitation of these space systems were the factors. SHAPE  \* MERGEFORMAT Figure 2.  U.S. Army concept developers envision a host of warfighting capabilities enhanced or enabled by space platforms and systems. But as military operators have taken great advantage of the advances in space capabilities, what has the military modeling and simulation community accomplished in the same time frame?  Unfortunately, the answer is not as much. Why?  Because space operations representations are not accorded the same importance as other functional or operational representations in simulations. Not until space events are fully incorporated in training and simulation events, will the tactics, techniques, and procedures for different space events be developed. [2]Space Representations in M&SDespite apparent attempts to continuously increase realism, all simulation simplifies reality to enable insight or stimulate thought or activity in the absence of random outside influences.  Trainers may dismiss space as one of those influences unless they understand that the massive force operations of the Soviet era Army have given way to hosts of smaller unit operations that increasingly place patrols outside the direct line-of-sight communications capacities of legacy radio systems.  Space systems fill that void cost effectively, but representations of space-based systems must be added to simulations of advanced concepts to enable realistic capability assessments and  to training environments to enable commanders and soldiers to train as they intend to fight.U.S. Army photo by Staff Sgt.

Satellites are in specific positions relative to the sun, the earth, and each other at any given date and time. Authoritative satellite position initialization data is stored in the form of Two Line Element (TLE) Sets.  TLEs are satellite location data sets produced by Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center and updates or alternates are available through internet connections at:  HYPERLINK "http://www.celestrak.com/NORAD/" http://www.celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/master.asp.  A TLE contains position data for a satellite at a specific date and time or epoch and serves to anchor an initialization sequence to preserve both relative and absolute satellite positions.  Each satellite representation also requires payload data for sensor and communications parameters.  Computational EfficienciesAs the numbers of entities grow within a simulation scenario, the computational load also increases.  If these entities are in “within range” of either on-board sensors or weapons, computational complexity growth is likely non-linear and simulation runtime increases.  Since space systems enjoy the military advantage of occupying the ultimate high ground, they can easily be considered within range of every entity on the battlefield and making this assumption could easily overload many modern simulations.Careful examination of a low earth orbit reveals some interesting characteristics that can be leveraged to create a computational efficiency for representing movement of space platforms.  As shown in Figure 4, in a “typical” low earth orbit, the satellite obits the earth in approximately 90 minutes or about 16 time per day.  Of these 16 orbits, only a few actually come within line of sight of any particular point on the earth (like the terrain box of an entity simulation).  During each 90 minute orbit, the satellite is only overhead for approximately 6 minutes or less.  Given these attributes, certain efficiencies can be realized in an algorithm that focuses computational effort on the critical six minutes rather than the irrelevant 94 minutes.Figure 4.  Simulation the precise position of a satellite at times when it cannot possibly influence the battle creates avoidable computational inefficiency.Traditional simulation approaches call for each entity to “move” into position and the check for line-of-sight or range to determine potential for influencing other systems. For tackling the problem from space, we’ve reversed the process by implicitly checking for the ability to influence before we bother to move.Algorithmic ApproachFrom the TLE data, we can calculate the time and longitudinal location of the satellite each time it crosses the equator.  As shown in Figure 5, for any specified place on earth, as satellite crossing the equator at some longitudes cannot possibly sense or communicate with the simulated combat entities at that spot.  Logically, those orbits can eliminated from a simulation algorithm or at least modeled in very low resolution with not expected impact on the ultimate outcome. SHAPE  \* MERGEFORMAT Figure 5.  We exclude from further consideration, orbits that have no potential to view or influence the terrain of the simulated battlefield.On careful examination, we see that even though several orbits have potential to view the terrain box.  Those orbits fall into two separate categories: ascending cases where the satellite is traveling with a north velocity component relative to the equatorial plane and descending case where the satellite is traveling south. Note also that the general nature of the motion is ¼ orbit north followed by ½ orbit south and then ¼ orbit north.    In Figure 6, we see that even within the orbits with influence potential, there is but a small fraction immediately around the terrain box that need be simulated in high resolution.  This means that the satellite can – for simulation purposes – be activated on turned on at the appropriate time and place for high resolution simulation and interaction. SHAPE  \* MERGEFORMAT Figure 6.  Only orbit fragments in close proximity to the terrain box can influence operations on the terrain.Example ImplementationAs shown in Figure 7, the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC) Future Warfare Center (FWC) implemented this approach and algorithm in a co-development laboratory supporting Program Manager- One Semi-Automated Force (OneSAF).  The initial satellites implemented in OneSAF include commercial electro optical imaging systems in Low Earth Orbit (LEO): Landsat, Indian Remote Sensing (IRS), Quickbird, Ikonos, and the French SPOT.  These systems contribute to modern military operations and their orbital parameters and payload parameters are readily available.Figure 7.  The SMDC FWC surrounded the OneSAF terrain box with satellite representations that “fly over” the terrain box at the appropriate times to image areas of interest. As shown in the conceptual model in Figure 8, much more than just movement was implemented in OneSAF to achieve a sufficiently robust space platform representation.  For example, commercial satellites interoperate with fixed ground stations around to download collected images.  These ground stations were explicitly represented in the initialization data and implicitly represented during simulation execution.  Image exploitation and relay to theater was implicitly represented as a user modifiable delay.Related On-going ResearchLow earth orbiting imagers represent just the beginning of space related M&S research being undertaken by the FWC.  Other projects include:Satellite communications – robust representations of data and voice links to include transponder/channel saturation and atmospheric signal attenuation to us to assess constellation robustness, under-utilization, and over commitments;Joint blue force situational awareness – explicit representations of GPS satellites and computationally efficient representations of dilution of precision to enable errors in perceived locations;Synthetic satellite imagery – very high resolution scenes of very large areas showing accurate simulated entity states and orientations;Hyper-spectral Imagery – using a vast portion of the light spectrum, most notably in the visible and infrared areas of the spectrum to collect the same picture on many bands of the light spectrum to generate a “datacube” that can reveal objects and information that more limited scanners cannot pick up.References[1]	George W.
