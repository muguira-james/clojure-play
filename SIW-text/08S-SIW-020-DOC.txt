GM-VV will offer the international M&S community with a Verification, Validation (VV) and Acceptance methodology that consistently embraces a wide variety of M&S technologies and application domains. The GM-VV builds upon a triad of three pillars; the products, the organization and process pillar. At the centre of the products pillar stands the GM-VV data information model. The GM-VV data information model is the structural model for the GM-VV project memory approach. This project memory not only stores the GM-VV core products but also serve as the data and information source for generating these products.  In this paper the formal specification of the GM-VV data information model and its underlying principles, concepts and methods are presented. The paper shows how this model is used in the GM-VV project memory approach to produce the core GM-VV products being: the acceptance plan, the verification & validation plan, the evidence, the verification &validation report, and the acceptance report. IntroductionThe Generic Methodology for Verification, Validation and Acceptance (GM-VV), currently being developed by the SISO GM-VV Product Development Group, is aimed to be an internationally accepted generic VV&A standard. Compared to other VV&A standards the GM-VV is not biased towards any pre-selection of M&S technologies, development paradigms or problem domains  REF _Ref190081380 \r \h [4]  REF _Ref190581135 \r \h [5]  REF _Ref190581138 \r \h [6]  REF _Ref190081461 \r \h [7]  REF _Ref190081309 \r \h [19]  REF _Ref190081562 \r \h [21]. Moreover, GM-VV adopts a goal-driven approach instead of the classical procedural approach often found in these VV&A standards. This goal-driven approach is considered in a context of the M&S system intended use, development, use-risk, VV&A cost-benefits and project constraints  REF _Ref190077953 \r \h [1]. These contextual aspects are also the key parameters in tailoring the GM-VV for a specific application. Guidance on tailoring of the GM-VV will be an intrinsic part of the methodology itself  REF _Ref190077955 \r \h [2].Another unique feature of the GM-VV compared to other VV&A standards will be its utilization of a (semi)formal evidence-based argumentation framework  REF _Ref190077979 \r \h [3]. This framework facilitates the development of well argued acceptance recommendation for an M&S system in a systematic and traceable manner. The basic principle for this argumentation is non-refutation in conjunction with cost and risk management. This yields that the GM-VV will search for an optimal solution within given the cost and risk constraints, which states that no convincing evidence can be found to support the claim that the M&S system is not acceptable for its intended use.A major objective of the GM-VV is to enhance the reuse and interoperability of VV&A results, techniques and tools within the M&S community. To facilitate this GM-VV will center its VV&A core-products and activities around a formally defined data information model (DIM) for VV&A. This model is intended to be the heart of the so-called project memory approach, which will generate all VV&A information and stores data in a traceable manner. The project memory approach embodies GM-VVâ€™s solution for the pragmatic execution and necessary tool support for VV&A projects.This paper starts in Section  REF _Ref190556165 \n \h 2 with a presentation of the GM-VV project memory approach and its underlying principles. Based on this discussion Section  REF _Ref190557125 \n \h 3 presents the conceptual top-level design for the GM-VV DIM. In the next sections the six sub-models of the GM-VV DIM will be discussed in more detail. The paper ends in Section  REF _Ref190557696 \n \h 4 with several concluding remarks and future work on the GM-VV DIM.GM-VV Project Memory ApproachDuring VV&A projects larges amount of data and information needs to be processed and managed to provide the essential VV&A knowledge for a M&S system. This management and processing is a complex and time consuming task that is hard to be done by hand. Therefore, a practical and cost-effective implementation of any rigorous VV&A methodology requires computer assisted tooling. Such tools have to be accessible for all participants within a VV&A project. GM-VV provides a macroscopic architecture and capabilities specification for the development of such support tools. This will be an integral part of the methodology itself and is known as the VV&A project memory approach ( REF _Ref191362091 \h Figure 1).Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 1: GM-VV Project Memory ApproachThe GM-VV project memory approach is embodied by a technical object that consists of a structured VV&A knowledge base in combination with process management capabilities. The basis for this knowledge-base is the GM-VV data information model (DIM). This model captures all GM-VV technical objects (ToVVA, ToE, VVA-Case, E-Case and VV Information), encountered issues during VV&A activities and relationships for data, information and knowledge management  REF _Ref190077979 \n \h [3]. Such logical (semantics) and chronological (temporal) relationships provide the linkage of the DIM components to the GM-VV VV&A process activities  REF _Ref190077955 \r \h [2]. This is essential for project memory management capabilities in support of version control, scheduling, coordination and traceability of VV&A activities and their outcomes. An important feature, since GM-VV allows for incremental and distributed execution of VV&A activities and development of outcomes.The GM-VV project memory provides a generic interface layer that allows for import, export and views on VV&A data, information and knowledge in various formats. In GM-VV five standard product export formats have been defined, which are the Acceptance Plan, V&V Plan, Acceptance Report, V&V Report and VV&A Project Status or Milestone Reports  REF _Ref190077953 \r \h [1]  REF _Ref190077955 \r \h [2]. Basically, these kinds of documents provide a representational and contextual view on specific parts of the GM-VV project memory at a given point in time or phase in the VV&A project. By using template structures as kinds of plug-ins the GM-VV project memory should be able to generate commonly used VV&A documentation or any other kind export files  REF _Ref190081380 \n \h [4]  REF _Ref190581138 \n \h [6]  REF _Ref190081461 \n \h [7]  REF _Ref190079749 \n \h [15]. The other way around, various kinds of data, information and knowledge sources and formats have to be imported, by means of plug-in converters, into the project memory. A special bidirectional interface will be provided for corporate memories to benefit from legacy M&S and VV&A knowledge, and for return of VV&A project investment, results and experience. Summarized, this interface layer facilitates efficient data, information and knowledge exchange inside the VV&A project among the VV&A team members (acceptance leader, VV leader, etc.), the M&S system beneficiaries (sponsor, use, etc.) and all other external parties involved  REF _Ref190077953 \r \h [1]  REF _Ref190077955 \r \h [2].GM-VV DIM Architecture & ConceptsThe data information model architecture is based on the requirement that it should be independent from any specific M&S problem or application domain standards or knowledge representations. This yields an architectural design of the DIM that is generic enough to meet this objective without being too abstract and therefore loosing its practical usability. UML has been chosen as the graphical design language to develop the GM-VV DIM.Goal and Claim Argumentation Network A large portion of the DIM is developed up and around an argumentation network structure. This selection directly stems from two important GM-VV concepts: goal-driven and evidence based VV&A. Summarized this means that within GM-VV the VV&A objective(s) is specified in the context M&S system intended use, development, use-risk, VV&A cost-benefits and project constraints  and drive the whole VV&A project execution in order to developed evidence that either supports or refutes the proposition that the M&S system is acceptable for intended use (Section  REF _Ref190846684 \r \h 1). To this extend the VV&A objective(s) has to be translated into a set of solvable acceptability criteria plus associated evidence development strategies and goals. Vice versa based upon the generate evidence it has to be argued that these acceptability criteria are met and merged upwards into an well argued acceptability claim or recommendation about the M&S system. For this purpose there exist a wide range of argumentation techniques  REF _Ref190079626 \r \h [10]. To maintain generality, adopts the results of a standardization effort in this area called, Argumentation Interchange Format (AIF)  REF _Ref190078955 \r \h [8].The AIF is an ontology of argument-related concepts. This ontology can be extended to capture a variety of argumentation formalisms and schemes. Furthermore, the ontology is designed to support interoperability and interchange between argumentation tools. AIF assumes that argument entities can be represented as nodes an in directed graph ( REF _Ref190849365 \h  \* MERGEFORMAT Figure 2). Depending on its usage this di-graph is either called a goal network or an argument network. Goal networks are used in a top down fashion for reasoning around the decomposition of a top-level objective (within a certain context) into smaller goals and finally into a set of practical solutions to accomplish the objective. An argument network structure works in the opposite way by aggregating evidence into claims, and claims into top-level claims.Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 2 The AIF OntologyAll classes in the AIF ontology are abstract classes that require concretization by sub-classing. This is one of the extension mechanisms to leverage the AIF ontology for various argumentation formalism implementations. AIF itself does provide several possible subclasses that could readily be used and there exist several extensions that implement or tailor the AIF for specific purposes  REF _Ref190078957 \r \h [9]. The other way is to use the AIF ontology as a template structure or pattern that needs to be instantiated  REF _Ref190848731 \r \h [11]. Both extension mechanisms have been used for the DIM and can be used inside DIM for tailoring.DIM Top-Level Design The top level design of the DIM contains five object classes and five subsystems or models ( REF _Ref190859368 \h Figure 3). The central DIM sub-model is the VV&A System of Interest (Section  REF _Ref190858629 \n \h 4). This sub-model is the GM-VV data and information view on the M&S system that is subject to VV&A. The data and information contents of the VV&A-SoI model is constraint by the VV&A context, which is an aggregation of the M&S system intended use, the associated M&S use risk and the VV&A constraints imposed on the VV&A project. The VV&A goal model encapsulates all the data and information regarding the VV&A objectives and how they have been transformed into acceptability criteria utilizing the AIF (Section  REF _Ref191029989 \n \h 5). The goal model is constraint by the VV&A context. This yields that the VV&A goals are determined by the M&S intended use, are prioritized by the M&S use risks and feasibility is limited by the VV&A constraints. The evidence criteria model specifies all the data and information regarding to the generation of appropriate evidence which is necessary to evaluate the acceptability criteria (Section  REF _Ref191031065 \n \h 6). Therefore, this model is an AIF based extension of the VV&A goal model. There exist types of sources to elicit data and information to generate this evidence, which are the VV&A SoI and the problem world sources (i.e. real-world). All the elicited data and information from these sources is utilized in the evidence data sub-model (Section  REF _Ref191134477 \r \h 7). This sub-model specifies how the factual evidence for the acceptability criteria has been generated from the aforementioned sources by means of an AIF based claim argumentation network.Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 3 GM-VV Data Information Model: Top-Level ViewThe last DIM sub-model is the VV&A claim model, which provides all data and information on how the supporting items of evidence of the evidence data model have been aggregated into a well argued acceptance recommendation for the VV&A SoI (Section  REF _Ref191137796 \r \h 8). This model is also build around an AIF claim argumentation network. The acceptance recommendation outcomes might affect the VV&A Context. The M&S intended use could be adjusted if the M&S system is not acceptable for the original intended use, or in case the uncertainties are too high of the acceptance recommendation the VV&A constraints have to be altered to do for instance more data or information elicitation a specific area.In the next sections the paper will present and discuss each DIM sub-model in more detail.VV&A System of Interest ModelThe VV&A SoI model consist of a number of sub-models that derive from the GM-VV M&S employment and development three pillars concept (Section  REF _Ref191143624 \r \h 4.1). Their specification is based on an M&S systems engineering approach (Section  REF _Ref191144509 \r \h 4.2).M&S Employment & Development PillarsThe objective of any M&S effort or project is to generate M&S answers to real-world problems by means of a well controlled employment of M&S enabling products. These enabling products comprise various technical means like simulator hardware, model implementations, federations, etc. Such controlled employment requires the existence of an M&S organizational structure and associated process such that the M&S enabling products are effectively and efficiently used to provide the appropriate M&S answers. If not there is a risk that an incorrect M&S answer is produced or at such costs that the M&S solution may lose its utility or both. Therefore, the key objective of GM-VV is to perform VV&A on the M&S employment context as a whole and not only on the enabling products. To specify this, GM-VV applies the three pillars triad concept known from standard project management ( REF _Ref191150271 \h Figure 4).Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 4 Three Pillars View of M&S EmploymentWithin GM-VV this triad of M&S enabling products, employment process and organization is formally defined as the M&S system. From this perspective the objective of any M&S development project is generalized in GM-VV as; to develop an M&S system, which fits its intended use. Independently whether this development comprises preparation of a legacy M&S system, creation of a new M&S system or a construction of a federation based M&S system, in GM-VV the M&S system is considered to be the product of well organized and executed development process. GM-VV applies the three pillars paradigm to the M&S development context as well ( REF _Ref191151881 \h Figure 5).Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 5 Three Pillars View of M&S DevelopmentThe GM-VV three pillars view explicitly specifies the relationship between M&S effort objectives, the realizing M&S system and its development. This yields that VV&A efforts done during M&S development should always be performed in the context of M&S employment. Thus VV&A data and information generated during M&S system development complements those generated from VV&A efforts on the developed M&S enabling products and their actual employment itself. Within the GM-VV, VV&A efforts during M&S system development are seen as activities that provide early and additional evidence in support of an acceptance recommendation. Compared to VV&A evidence from the M&S employment context the generation of M&S development VV&A evidence is not always possible, is premature and has less convincing force. VV&A evidence from M&S development is most beneficial for M&S development decision making.M&S Systems Engineering FoundationM&S enabling products could be complex systems that mimic equally or even more complex real-world systems. To properly deal with such complexity during VV&A efforts, GM-VV adopts a modular and hierarchical structured system specification  REF _Ref191161339 \n \h [12]. This M&S systems engineering approach treats systems as a group of coupled modular sub-systems at various aggregation levels. Such sub-systems are coupled and interact with each other by means of ports to produce the aggregated behavior of the supra-system ( REF _Ref191362167 \h Figure 6). These ports provide the means to observe the supra-system or one of its sub-systems. At the highest aggregation level the supra-system is considered as a black-box that is studied from the outside by observables associated with its ports. Depending on the level of detail is needed for the VV&A effort a system (i.e. an enabling product) is specified in more detail by means of expansion or recursive decomposition of the system in smaller sub-systems (Section  REF _Ref191169271 \n \h 4.4). If a system is specified up to the smallest level of detail, this view is referred in GM-VV as the white-box view. Any intermediate level is called grey-box view.Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 6 System and Frame System ViewSystems are always studied or analyzed within a certain context. The frame system concept is used in GM-VV as the formalization of this context, by specifying the set of circumstances under which a system is observed and experimented with or used otherwise  REF _Ref191161339 \n \h [12]. In other words a frame system is a formal specification of the operational usage of a system of interest to meet its intended use objectives ( REF _Ref191168173 \h Figure 6). A frame system, or experimental frame, is a dynamic system in itself and is therefore also formalized in terms of a hierarchical decomposition of coupled and modular components. Frame systems are used by GM-VV to specify both the M&S experimental context for employment (Section  REF _Ref191169271 \n \h 4.4) and VV&A experimental context (Section  REF _Ref191031065 \n \h 6) inside the DIM.VV&A SoI Model Top-Level ViewThe VV&A SoI model at the highest level is specified in terms of four sub-models ( REF _Ref191265837 \h Figure 7). These sub-models are based on the M&S development and employment pillars discussed in Section  REF _Ref191143624 \r \h 4.1.Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 7 VV&A SoI Model Top-Level ViewThe M&S development process sub-model specifies all relevant VV&A data and information regarding the M&S development process used to build the M&S system. The M&S development organization sub-model specifies the VV&A data and information of the associated M&S organization involved in the M&S development. The M&S development products sub-model contains relevant VV&A data and information related for any intermediate and additional M&S products that are produced during the development of the M&S system. This yields VV&A data and information on products like M&S requirement specifications, conceptual models, software designs, and federation integration or simulator component tests.The M&S system sub-model is composed of three smaller sub-models: M&S enabling products, M&S employment organization and process ( REF _Ref191269822 \h Figure 8). These sub-models are the formal realization of the three pillars view on the M&S employment context (Section  REF _Ref191143624 \n \h 4.1). The M&S employment organization sub-model specifies all VV&A relevant data and information regarding the organization that employs the M&S products in the M&S enabling products sub-model (Section  REF _Ref191169271 \n \h 4.4). These products are employed by utilization in a process that is specified by the M&S employment process sub-model. Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 8  M&S System Sub-Model Top-Level ViewThe M&S system model also specifies the available ports of the M&S system of interest (Section  REF _Ref191144509 \n \h 4.2). Through these ports the M&S system behavior can be specified and observed during any VV&A activity. Three types of ports are defined at this level: cost, use risk and value. Value ports are used to characterize how effectively the M&S system provides the appropriate M&S answers. Cost ports provide the opportunity to assess, in terms of money and time, the value-to-cost ratio of the M&S system i.e. the M&S efficiency. Any M&S enabling product is an approximation of the real-world and its employment is error prone as well. Therefore, there exist always certain risks in applying an M&S system. Use risks ports are utilized for assessing such use risks as part of the VV&A effort. All three together are used to analyze and demonstrate the M&S system utility for its intended use; the ultimate VV&A objective of GM-VV.Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 9 M&S Enabling Products Sub-ModelM&S Enabling Products Sub-ModelIn this section the white-box view of the VV&A SoI M&S enabling products sub-model is presented to further illustrate the scope and depth of the GM-VV DIM. Within the M&S enabling products sub-model two core enabling M&S products are identified, the simulation executable model (SEM) and the experimental frame (EF) ( REF _Ref191274510 \h Figure 9). Both are the outcome of the M&S development.The SEM is the physical product that enables the actual replication of the real-world system of interest over time, i.e. simulation. Usually a SEM is a complex dynamic system, which is composed of a set of coupled smaller components or sub-modules (federates, terrain model, weather model, visual system, motion system, etc.). The M&S EF provides the implementation of the operational conditions (configuration settings, parameters, scenarioâ€™s etc.) and tools with which the SEM is observed and utilized or experimented with in order to provide those simulation results that provide the desired M&S answers. Depending on the type, complexity and number of M&S questions many different experimental frames may need to be defined for the same SEM.Data and information about both M&S products are specified in two levels, a black-box (purple classes) and a white-box level (white classes). At the black-box level only the externally known data and information of the M&S products is specified. This includes the interface description in terms of the available ports to control and observe the SEM and EF product behavior for both VV&A purposes and M&S employment by actors in M&S employment organization. Usually such actors are either the directly the end-users or specially trained system operators. These external ports are also used to port data and information to the M&S value, use risk and cost ports at M&S system sub-model level to facilitate VV&A assessment of M&S system utility (Section  REF _Ref191276420 \n \h 4.3).The white-box level data and information specification of the M&S enabling products provides information on the internal composition and behavior of the SEM and EF. For both these specifications the modular and hierarchical structured system approach is implemented as a recursive composite-component pattern (Section  REF _Ref191144509 \n \h 4.2). Port mapping is used to specify the relationship and interaction between the internal sub-components. Additional mappings are used to specify how the internal ports contribute to the external ports as specified and observable at black-box level. However, it depends on the access rights (security) to M&S product internals whether such detailed data and information is available for VV&A purposes. VV&A Goal ModelThe VV&A goal model is a sub-model of the GM-VV DIM outlined Section  REF _Ref191281968 \r \h 3.2. This model contains all data and information on the development and specification of the concrete solvable VV&A acceptability criteria. The skeleton for this VV&A Goal Model is formed by an goal-oriented network structure. This network is based on the AIF ontology introduced in section  REF _Ref191282065 \r \h 3.1 and is depicted in  REF _Ref191282842 \h Figure 10 by the white class structure. The Target of VVA (ToVVA) is a concrete class derived from the AIF ontology and serves as the main access point to the VV&A goal model. The two key classes of this model are the strategy and goal. The strategy is the concrete implementation of the abstract AIF S-Node super-class and describes a goal decomposition strategy. This decomposition is based upon the utilization of a specific argumentation schema implementation which binds to the strategy. The goal class is an abstract class that derives from the AIF I-Node class. Its purpose is to abstract the concept of goal and the associated attributes shared by the concrete goal implementations (acceptability criteria, VVA objective and VVA goal) inside the ToVVA.There exist two main attributes for a goal; the proposition and acceptance rule. A proposition specifies the VV&A property (correctness, validity, etc.) that has to be proven or satisfied. The acceptance rule specifies the needed argumentation that has to be used for the final acceptance recommendation to argue whether such proposition on the M&S system is proven or refuted. In addition the acceptance rule also takes into account the satisfaction evaluation of any meta-property criteria that can be specified in association to the proposition of each goal. Meta-properties express supporting criteria on the quality for the VV&A evidence that is used in this reasoning process about M&S correctness, validity, etc. Examples of such meta-properties include evidence completeness, reliability and relevance. An acceptance rule can thus specify complex compound argumentations.Within a target of VVA argumentation network only one root node can exist which specifies the highest level goal of a VV&A project. This node is the VVA objective class and is always a utility goal. The leaf nodes inside a ToVVA are always acceptability criteria class instances. Compared to the VVA goal and the VVA objective, an acceptability criterion specifies those goals for the M&S system that can directly be proven or refuted by means of evidence. Therefore, acceptability criteria specify, on top of the inherited properties, a feasible and desired solution for generating appropriate items of evidence. This is done in terms of specifying high-level criteria for the referent (in terms of local oracles for VV&A) and VV&A test methods for the M&S system.Both the strategy and goal nodes can be considered in one or more GS contexts. This goal structure context class specifies the additional data and information on the environment in which a node is constructed. A GS context class thus amplifies and clarifies the meaning of a strategy or a goal node. During the development of a ToVVA argumentation network these context classes will also contribute to the further refinement of the overall VVA context (Section  REF _Ref191281968 \n \h 3.2) and the VVA-SoI model data and information (Section  REF _Ref191284674 \n \h 4).To enable modular structuring and delegation during GM-VV based VV&A activities a special I-node has been added, the M-node. This M-node implements modularity by means of a proxy-pattern that provides a placeholder for another VVA goal to control access or reference to it. Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 10 GM-VV VV&A Goal ModelVV&A Evidence Criteria ModelThe VV&A evidence criteria model is a sub-model of the GM-VV DIM outlined Section  REF _Ref191281968 \r \h 3.2. This model contains all information on the development and specification of the required evidence to demonstrate the evaluation of the acceptability criteria in the VV&A goal model (Section  REF _Ref191029989 \n \h 5). The skeleton of the VV&A evidence criteria model is formed by an AIF based goal-oriented network structure, depicted by the white classes in  REF _Ref191286907 \h Figure 11.  The target of evidence (ToE) is the concrete class derived from the AIF ontology and serves as the access point to the VV&A evidence criteria model. Each node class in the ToE is considered in context, the evidence context, which amplifies and clarifies their meaning. Unlike the VV&A goal model the ToE can contain more than one root node. This is due to the fact that each acceptability criteria leaf from the VV&A goal model serves as the basis for the well argued specification of items of evidence and their development. Each VV&A goal model acceptability criteria is linked in the GM-VV DIM to the ToE by means of the so-called acceptability criteria proxy class. The strategy and goal classes are concretized in the ToE network by the oracle criteria and VV test case criteria classes  REF _Ref190077979 \r \h [3]  REF _Ref190079490 \r \h [14]  REF _Ref190079495 \r \h [15]. Both are leaf nodes that derive directly from these acceptability criteria proxies by a network of interrelated strategies.An oracle criteria class specifies an oracle to benchmark the V&V results, which come from related V&V test case executions on the M&S system, in order to produce items of evidence for acceptability criteria. This class specifies all data and information for the required reference source, how reference data should be generated from this source and the procedure to benchmark the V&V results against this reference data. The union of the information sources and reference information contained by all oracle criteria inside the ToE, form the formal specification of what is commonly know as the validation referent  REF _Ref190081380 \r \h [4]  REF _Ref190081461 \r \h [7].The VV test case criteria class specifies a set of criteria for a V&V test case that has to be conducted with the M&S system to generate V&V results, which can be assessed against an oracle to provide evidence for the acceptability criteria. It specifies all information and data for stimulating and observing the M&S system or one or more of its constituent components through various kinds of M&S system ports. Furthermore, information and data is provided for the associated conditions for proper test-case execution along with the needed equipment, logging, processing and input data sequencing methods to generate the required V&V results. The union of all VV test case criteria in the ToE specify the requirements for the VV&A experimental frame for the M&S system and serve as the basis for the what is commonly know as the VV&A plan  REF _Ref190077953 \r \h [1]  REF _Ref190081380 \r \h [4]  REF _Ref190081461 \r \h [7].Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 11 GM-VV Evidence Criteria ModelVV&A Claim ModelThe VV&A claim model is a sub-model of the GM-VV DIM outlined Section  REF _Ref191281968 \r \h 3.2. This model contains all information on the development and specification of well argued acceptance recommendation for the M&S system. The VV&A claim model is the dual of the VV&A goal model (Section  REF _Ref191029989 \n \h 5). This yields that the skeleton of the VV&A claim model, which is an AIF claim-argument-evidence oriented network, can directly be related to and traced back to the VV&A goal model classes  REF _Ref190079626 \n \h [10]. Thus the overall claim model structure is the similar to the goal model as depicted in  REF _Ref191282842 \h Figure 10. For brevity only the most important difference are discussed here. More details are given in the preliminary GM-VV documentation  REF _Ref190077979 \n \h [3].The VVA case is the concrete class derived from the AIF argumentation ontology that serves as the main access point to the VV&A claim model. Since the VVA case is claim-argument-evidence oriented the two key classes of this model are the argument and claim. The argument is the concrete implementation of the abstract AIF S-node and specifies the argumentation in support of a claim. This argument directly relates to an acceptance rule for a VV&A proposition or property (correctness, validity, etc.) that has been specified by a goal inside the VV&A goal model. A claim is an abstract class that derives from the AIF I-node. Its purpose is to abstract the concept of a claim and associated attributes shared by the three concrete claim implementations inside the VVA Case; the acceptability claim, the VVA recommendation and the VVA claim. A claim contains a proposition that states an acceptance conclusion on a VV&A property specified by a goal in the VV&A goal model. This claim proposition is the concluding outcome of the application and evaluation of the specified goal acceptance rule with respect to an actual observed VV&A property and associated meta-properties of the M&S system (Section  REF _Ref191029989 \n \h 5). The probative force specified in a claim gives the judgment of a claimâ€™s strength based on its observed meta-properties in relation to the criteria specified on them in the VV&A goal model.The acceptance recommendation is the root-node of the VVA case and is the counterpart of the VVA objective inside the ToVVA (Section  REF _Ref191029989 \n \h 5). This claim node specifies the overall M&S system acceptance recommendation in the context of M&S intended use and risks. Acceptability claims are a special class of claims since they are the glue between the VVA case and the items of evidence of in the VV&A evidence model (Section  REF _Ref191277402 \n \h 8). Acceptability claims endorse and group supporting items of evidence based upon the related acceptability criteria specification of the VV&A goal model. These items of evidence form the leaf nodes of the VVA case network structure.VV&A Evidence Data ModelThe VVA evidence data model contains all information regarding the development and specification of well argued evidence to evaluate the acceptability criteria for the M&S system as specified by the VVA goal Model (Section  REF _Ref191029989 \n \h 5). The VVA Evidence Data Model is the dual of the VVA evidence criteria model (Section  REF _Ref191031065 \n \h 6). This yields that the skeleton of the VVA evidence data model is an AIF based claim-argument-evidence oriented network structure, which can be directly related to and traced back to the VVA evidence criteria model classes ( REF _Ref191286907 \h Figure 11). For brevity only the important difference are discussed here. More details can be found in the preliminary GM-VV documentation  REF _Ref190077979 \n \h [3]The evidence case is a concrete class derived from the AIF argumentation ontology and serves as the main access point to the VVA evidence data model. Since the evidence case, like the VVA case, is a claim-argument-evidence network the two key classes of this model are argument and claim. These classes are identical to and serve a similar purpose as the ones in the VV&A claim model (Section  REF _Ref191137796 \n \h 7). Like its counterpart, the evidence case can contain more than one root node. These root nodes are the actual items of evidence that have been generated in relationship to one or more acceptability criteria of the VVA goal model. An item of evidence is special claim class that specifies the actual endorsed oracle evaluation outcome, which is the results of a test-oracle based evidence generation and conformance evaluation process  REF _Ref190077979 \n \h [3]  REF _Ref190079490 \n \h [14]. This process is briefly summarized by  REF _Ref191279208 \h Figure 12.Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 12 GM-VV Evidence Generation ProcessThis evaluation outcome and its endorsement are assessed by an argumentation network. This argumentation is based on the evaluation of the actual underlying V&V test results and applied oracles against the reasoning rules and criteria specified by the associated acceptability criteria, VV test case criteria and oracle criteria of the VV&A evidence criteria model (Section  REF _Ref191031065 \n \h 6). Data and information regarding these argumentations are formally specified in the evidence case by argument classes (Section  REF _Ref191137796 \n \h 7). A VVA test result class is utilized to specify all data and information on the VV result generation. Besides the actual VV results this class also specifies the observed raw M&S system output data as well as the actual applied M&S system input data and test conditions. Furthermore, it specifies the used equipment, logging, processing and input data sequencing methods to generate the VV results. Therefore, the VVA test result class is the counterpart of the VV test case criteria in the ToE (Section  REF _Ref191031065 \n \h 6).In similar fashion the oracle class is the counterpart of the oracle criteria specified by the ToE. An oracle class specifies all relevant data and information for an actual oracle that is used in the test oracle base conformance evaluation of the associated V&V test results in order to produce items of evidence. The union of the information sources and reference information contained by all oracle inside the evidence Case, which relate to the real-world representational capabilities of the M&S System, form the formal specification used validation referent  REF _Ref190081380 \r \h [4]  REF _Ref190081461 \r \h [7].VV&A Meta-Data ModelThe meta-data model is considered to be a DIM accessory sub-model, which defines a series of model classes to specify data or information that is used to facilitate the understanding, usage and management of all previously discussed DIM sub-models during VV&A projects. In other words the meta-data model provides the means to specify additional data or information on top of these DIM sub-models. This is done by specifying meta-data and information classes that can be associated to a sub-model of the DIM and its constituent model classes. The meta-data model is the least mature DIM sub-model and its classes will be based upon the knowledge available from the existing DoD Discovery Meta-Data Specification, the outcomes of the current DoD project on Standardized Documentation for VV&A and other related metadata standards  REF _Ref190079749 \r \h [16]  REF _Ref190079751 \r \h [17]  REF _Ref190079752 \r \h [18]  REF _Ref190079756 \r \h [19]. The exact metadata that is required for effective GM-VV DIM management varies with the type of data, context of use and the consolidation inside specific corporate memories. In the GM-VV context these requirements need further study and alignment with other efforts in the same area  REF _Ref190079749 \r \h [16]. This is particularly of interest in the light of tool support, interoperability and sharing of VV&A data, information and knowledge across organizations; for example in VV&A of distributed simulation development and employment, and net-centric data environments.Discussion and Future WorkThe Data Information Model (DIM) presented in this paper is still under development. The current status is that the GM-VV DIM is a conceptual model for the final generic data information model for VV&A. Although a more detailed implementation needs to be created, it provides a good indication of the technical basis and the direction towards the current development is progressing. In the end the GM-VV DIM shall provide such a formal specification of VV&A data that it will facilitates the development of GM-VV project memory based tools that support VV&A projects in handling and generation of VV&A data and products, their reuse and interoperability.The extensive usage of the AIF ontology and other M&S engineering standards guarantees an open and flexible DIM architecture that should allow for interoperability with other efforts in the VV&A domain and tailoring. Moreover, it provides a precise and systematic manner to develop VV&A objectives, goals, acceptability criteria and evidence in a formal manner. Furthermore, the DIM allows for transparent and traceable formal argumentation in support of the VV&A acceptance recommendation for a specific intended use of an M&S system. Similar, this strongly rooted argumentation approach of the DIM will also facilitate decision-making and risk management activities during M&S system development.The thus far limited experience obtained in using the GM-VV approach indicates that the such aforementioned advantages of a formal DIM specifications will indeed be feasible   REF _Ref190081309 \n \h [20]  REF _Ref190081560 \r \h [21]. More test-cases with the GM-VV will be performed in the near future to further develop, refine and assess the benefits of the GM-VV DIM. In this effort we seek alliance and cooperation with other initiatives such as with the DoD and SISO  REF _Ref190081380 \n \h [4]  REF _Ref190079749 \r \h [16]. Some of our test-cases showed that GM-VV and the VV&A overlay for the FEDEP are compatible and complementary  REF _Ref190081309 \n \h [20]  REF _Ref190081562 \r \h [22]. We are also actively trying to (re)use VV&A work performed by the DoD-MSCO and NATO-NMSG.  REF _Ref190081461 \r \h [7]. For tailoring purposes and specific M&S applications of the DIM, a number of aids are envisioned such as already tailed objects for specific application areas and sets of patterns that occur often across application areas  REF _Ref190848731 \n \h [11]. AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank Ad van Lier of the Dutch MoD Simulation Expertise Centre for sponsoring the continuation of this work inside the REVVA project.
