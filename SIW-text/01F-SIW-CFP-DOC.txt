Though SBA is also known by several other names (Simulation and Modeling for Acquisition, Requirements and Training  (SMART), Synthetic Environment Based Acquisition (SeBA), and others), the concepts and principles that underpin all these simulation based acquisition initiatives are all very similar. In the Forum and Group CFP information section that follows, papers on topics spanning the SBA arena are solicited in support of this Workshop theme. This focus on SBA is based on the expressed community need for interoperability standards and practices to facilitate SBA programs and activities. More detailed information may be found at  HYPERLINK "http://www.sisostds.org/siw/forums/index.htm" http://www.sisostds.org/siw/forums/index.htm .                          INDIVIDUAL FORUM AND GROUP CFP INFORMATIONOverview. Generally, papers and presentations are considered in three main categories:  *  User Community Forums, which examine and promote topics of interest related to the use and adequacy of       available simulation capabilities and new capabilities needed by M&S users.  *  Specialty Area Forums, which examine and promote current and emerging simulation processes and       technology.  *  Virtual Forums, Study Groups, Product Development Groups, and Special Sessions, which deal with topics that       merit timely solicitation of feedback from the SISO community.Information call on “Grand Challenges.” Periodically, the SIW attempts to identify and single out specific overarching topics of general interest to the M&S community.  This fall, the SIW will explore the question, “What are the Grand Challenges the M&S community faces as it goes forward?” Grand Challenges are defined as achievable M&S improvements that both fulfill a critical need and require significant and sustained development efforts from diverse groups to succeed. To address this topic, the SIW seeks short position papers from international defense agencies, and from industry, medical, transportation, entertainment, law enforcement organizations on those complex and multi-faceted activities that are viewed as needing collaborative efforts spanning multiple domains (e.g., data, M&S, infrastructure, training, other?) to achieve a needed, critical solution or solutions in one or more application domains.As in all SIW work, the focus is on interoperability standards. Detailed information on the Grand Challenges information call may be found at  HYPERLINK "http://www.sisostds.org/siw/forums/index.htm" http://www.sisostds.org/siw/forums/index.htmShort synopses of the individual forum and group Calls for Papers are provided below.
