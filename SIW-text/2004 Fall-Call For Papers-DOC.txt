Please also refer to the web version of the CFP posted at HYPERLINK http://www.sisostds.org/siw/04Fall/index.htm http://www.sisostds.org/siw/04Fall/index.htm.  This version will include additional and updated information as it becomes available.USER COMMUNITY FORUMS    Analysis (ANL)ANL focuses on interoperability issues and uses of distributed models and simulations by the analysis community, including issues of experiment design and data analysis, analysis issues in ADS and SBA, requirements definition.  Special focus:  use cases that include both success and failure.    Research, Development, and Engineering (RDE) RDE addresses issues and applications of distributed M&S within the RDE domain.  For the Fall 2004 SIW, we are specifically asking for papers that describe some facet of simulation as it relates to Manufacturing.  RDE focuses on community requirements and experiences with new applications using distributed computing technologies.  RDE specifically solicits papers that advance the "state of the art" and/or take a position, however controversial.  Authors targeting papers to the RDE Forum must include, as the final slide in their presentations, a summary of the paper's key findings or concepts and identifying issues for the RDE Community.    System Acquisition and Product Development (SAPD)SAPD focuses on M&S and related enablers of integrated, collaborative enterprises for system/product development, particularly from a life-cycle wide, mission capability/system-of-systems perspective.Subjects include policy, processes, tool suite strategies, information management, standards, resource sharing/reuse, business case, intellectual property protection, collaboration/optimization means and work force implications. Priority is on actual, broadly-applicable experiences in these areas.    Test and Evaluation (TE)TE addresses uses of distributed simulation in test and evaluation (T&E), including the integration of live entities with virtual and constructive simulations; the integration of hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL), Integrated Systems Test Facilities (ISTFs), and other T&E facilities with distributed simulations; the use of simulation to test and evaluate C4ISR, Systems of Systems (SoS), Family of Systems (FoS), and interoperability; and performance issues in using distributed simulation in T&E applications.    Training (TRAIN)The TRAIN forum focuses on issues associated with using simulations to support the acquisition of knowledge, skills, behaviors, and attitudes through education, training, and performance support.  We solicit papers addressing simulation-based learning in industry, academia, and government (including the DOD), particularly those identifying interoperability or standards shortfalls or requirements.Special interest topics: (1) simulation support of all aspects of Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) and Distributed Mission Training (DMT) Programs: education, training, and performance support (e.g., embedded training, Computer-Based Training, automated performance assessment, mission rehearsal, Course of Action analysis, etc.);(2) simulation support to training events associated with Small Scale Contingencies (SSCs), Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT), Support and Stability Operations (SASO), and other related combat and non-combat activities and; (3) single vs multi-player/student training issues or lessons learned (individual vs collective/team simulation-based learning).SPECIALTY AREA FORUMS    Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I)C4I addresses standards to ensure interoperability when coupling simulation systems and C4I systems, standards to ensure composability when integrating simulation components and C4I components into a common framework, and standards to represent C4I systems and the underlying infrastructure within simulation applications.  C4I is looking for papers dealing with architecture and data/object model alignment, common frameworks, applicability of C4I standards and open standards, and lessons learned from applying these standards.  In particular, C4I is interested in the development of enhanced operational functionality based on M&S, and especially on increasing the efficiency and abilities of the Warfighter by introducing simulation capabilities within operational systems.  Finally, C4I is looking for Global Information Grid (GIG) related M&S and standard activities.    Communication, Frameworks, and Infrastructure (CFI)CFI focuses on technologies that support interoperation and run-time execution of distributed simulations.  Historical examples include the HLA Run-Time Infrastructure (RTI), DIS, ALSP, and SPEEDES.  The Forum will also consider new and alternate infrastructure concepts, such as web-based technologies.  Topics include performance data, implementation and design details, usage strategies, networking techniques, fault tolerance, security considerations, and middleware or other frameworks for constructing, utilizing, or extending simulation infrastructure.  NOTE:  The CFI forum replaces and incorporates the former RTI&C forum.    Distributed Simulation Processes and Tools (DSPT)DSPT focuses on evolving a generalized system engineering process for developing and executing distributed simulations, and on the tools used for automating various aspects of distributed simulations.  This includes "lessons learned" solutions from creating real-world, useful M&S applications, such as problems of integration, scalability, reuse, and robustness.Automation of various aspects of distributed simulations includes scenario development, initialization, monitoring, runtime controls, collection and repositories, visualization, and after-action review.    Information Operations - Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance    (IO-ISR)IO-ISR seeks papers that deal with all aspects of Information Operations (IO), including computer network attack and defense, modeling of IO in exercise and training, and threats to the Internet and other communications infrastructures.  IO-ISR seeks papers addressing Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) issues including representation of the different intelligence disciplines (e.g., SIGINT, IMINT, HUMINT, etc.) and the associated Tasking, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (TPED) systems and processes associated with the delivery of intelligence products to the warfighter.  In addition, we are interested in activities related to modeling IO-ISR, including Effects-Based Operations, Network Centric Warfare, Predictive Battlespace Awareness and crisis response.    Logistics and Enterprise Models (LOG)LOG focuses on simulations and simulation challenges associated with modeling supply chains, logistics management processes, logistics policies and business practices, as well as the portrayal of logistics in military simulations at all levels.  Topics of interest include innovative approaches to supporting network centric operations, rapid deployment forces, Operations Other Than War (OOTW), global commercial operations, and enterprise process simulations.  The latter include but are not limited to executable models of work flow, manufacturing, distribution, transportation and customer, patient, crowd, or traffic flow.    Medical Simulation (MED)MED focuses on interoperability standards that build upon already extensive medical interface standards for operational systems for robot-assisted surgery; command and control systems for medical situational awareness; medical models of varying resolutions for research and development; training systems for instruction and rehearsal; imaging systems for treatment planning and assessment; and logistic planning systems for security and disaster response.    Sensor Modeling and Simulation (SENS)SENS is an interdisciplinary forum that bridges the environmental and mission/system-related areas, including simulation of sensor effects, issues pertaining to the stimulation and simulation of sensor systems, incorporation of sensor system simulations into other simulations, and environmental effects on sensor systems.  Authors are encouraged to address SENS focus areas: accreditation discriminators for sensor simulation applications; sensor domain specific sources of noise, error, and bias; and sensor data fusion.    Simulated Natural Environment (SNE)SNE addresses multi-domain use and reuse of digital representations and models of the natural environment, including land, oceanic, atmospheric, and space data.  SNE also focuses on standards for, and application of, SNE data, effects and data models for M&S; interoperability issues and lessons learned in large-scale integrated simulations that include multiple real-time and non-real-time SNE representations; and issues and use cases relating to SEDRIS, environmental data classification systems, and coordinate transformation systems.    Synthetic Mission Space Composability (SMS-COMPOSE)SMS focuses on efforts underway within the Services and across the Joint and International community.  The Forum includes a panel session, conducted each workshop, addressing a particular issue or topic of interest.Panelists will include representatives from Service, Joint, and OSD efforts in Synthetic Mission Spaces.  One critical focus of the Panel session will be to identify areas of collaboration (as well as noncollaboration) among the  various participants. It will expose as well needs and potential solutions.  The objective is to explore ways to integrate various environments on-demand, so that the best tools and products available are brought to bear on a particular problem.    Verification, Validation & Accreditation (VV&A)VV&A focuses on methodologies, procedures, and associated techniques used to establish credibility of models, simulations, and federations.  VV&A goals emphasize quality (e.g., building in authoritative representations and behaviors) and risk management, and support development and evolution of VV&A guidance to enhance the federation lifecycle process.  Current objectives include evolving a model for validation process maturity, formalizing the conceptual model via the Conceptual Model Study Group, and establishing recommended practices for federation VV&A via the VV&A PDG.Special focus areas include validation process maturity model, conceptual model validation, and substantive interoperability.    Vehicle/Weapon System Modeling (VWS)VWS focuses on lessons learned in development of vehicle or weapon system simulations (including Computer Generated Forces (CGF) and Semi-Automated Forces (SAF) simulations) and Simulation Based Acquisition (SBA) of actual vehicle and weapon systems (DD 21, Joint Strike Fighter, Future Combat System, etc.).    STUDY GROUPSStudy Groups (SGs) are chartered when SISO wants to obtain recommendations on well-defined issues from groups of volunteer experts selected from appropriate Forums.  Study Group sessions at this Workshop include    Assessment of the Need for Product Data Representation Standards SG    (ANPDRS SG)The data required to represent systems and products in M&S is broad and diverse, including requirements, conceptual and physical design, manufacturing means, cost, system performance, and the product's operational and support environment.  The ANPDRS SG is reviewing existing methods of representing product data, identifying significant gaps in product data representation standards and ongoing activities to address these gaps, and, as warranted, recommending SISO Product DevelopmentGroup(s) to begin formulation of needed standards.    Discrete-Event Systems Specification (DEVS SG)DEVS has a theoretical foundation which makes it in principle independent of various programming languages and hardware platforms.There is a wide variety of groups working on extensions to the DEVS formalism, with several modeling tools based on these extensions. The goal of the study group will be to find a core of the DEVS formalism that is suitable for standardization of activities at the level of modeling.  It will bridge the gap between existing simulation frameworks and modeling activities using a standard notation.  The DEVS SG is studying the possibility of developing standards for a computer processable representation of DEVS that supports common understanding, sharing and interoperability of DEVS implementations.Computer processable forms include all forms of simulation and real-time execution as well as various forms of syntactic and semantic analysis.    DIS Extension SG (DIS SG)The DIS SG has been investigating the present use of Protocol Data Units (PDUs), which are the basis for communicating information among simulations under the DIS (IEEE 1278) standards.  They have also solicited inputs on the need to clarify and otherwise update IEEE 1278.1a. The DIS SG submitted a final report to the Spring SIW along with a PDG Nomination to request that the Study Group transition to a DIS Update Product Development Group (PDG) based on the results of the groups work.  It is expected that a DIS PDG will be charted shortly after the Spring SIW and work will begin on revising the 1278.1a DIS Standard.  The Problem/Change Request (PCR) process, the DIS SG Document Library and support to DIS users are expected to continue under the auspices of the DIS Update PDG.    Extensible Modeling and Simulation Framework Profile SG    (XMSF Profile SG)The XMSF Profile SG has several high-level requirements derived from years of experience with M&S frameworks and the challenges of their effective deployment across diverse networks and systems.  XMSF must enable simulations to interact directly and scalably over a highly distributed network, achieved through compatibility between a web framework and networking technologies.  The specification of XMSF will be in the form of a collection of profiles detailing how to interoperate with XMSF-compliant systems.  These profiles will enable inter-andintra- domain interoperability.  The initial profile content and structure must be agreed on.  As the underlying technologies and standards evolve, the profiles and will need to be upgraded to maintain interoperability.  The purpose of this SG is to determine the required scope for XMSF profiles and to define their structure.    Intelligent Tutoring System Interoperability SG (ITSI SG)The ITSI SG is working on interoperability between components of simulation-based training environments that include Socratic and didactic tutoring and coaching, personalized After-Action Review(AAR) and performance assessment, management of individual or team curriculum progress, student modeling, natural language dialog interaction with intelligent agents, authoring tools for creating or modifying courseware objects and ITS behavior, and quantitative measures of training effectiveness. The SG will draw on results from previous and concurrent efforts such as the Shareable Courseware Object Reference Model (SCORM), the Joint Modeling and Simulation(JMASS) Modeling and Simulation Reuse Library (MSRL), and the JSIMS Learning Methodology Working Group (LMWG), as well as standards developed by the Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C).    Medical Modeling and Simulation Interoperability SG (MM&S SG)Medical simulation systems have unique technical, operational, and regulatory requirements and serve a broad array of users and customers. Medical simulation increasingly needs interoperability standards that build upon already extensive medical interface standards. The MM&S SG  is identifying categories of M&S applications needed by the health care community and defining relevant information exchange requirements.    Open RTI Protocol SG (ORTI SG)The ORTI SG is a proposed communication and implementation standard for the High Level Architecture (HLA) RTI. Message formats and data handling algorithms for RTI services are encapsulated in an open, message-based protocol.  The handling algorithms for RTI services are encapsulated in an open, message-based protocol.  The study group is investigating the applicability of the Open RTI Protocol, facilitating interoperability between RTI implementations and promoting Research and Development (R&D).    Simulation Reference Markup Language (SRML) SGThis SG is focusing on standardizing a simulation markup language and corresponding simulation engine specification based on the Simulation Reference Markup Language (SRML). We will be capturing the goals needs, business case, and potential benefits to the simulation community, and summarizing the SRML survey. Additional discussions will relate SRML, to HLA, BOMs, XMSF, MDA, and other emerging trends, as well as various forms of standardization. Participants will have an opportunity to see Web-Based Simulation demonstrations, and discuss technical details.    Transfer of Control SG (TC SG)The TC SG completed its work as far as changes that are needed to the DIS transfer control design to make it more robust and ensure interoperability between simulations.  An interim report was presented at the Spring SIW that included a set of draft updates to IEEE 1278.1a and the DIS Enumeration Document.  These will be handed over to the DIS PDG once it is chartered.The Transfer of Control SG will continue work on the HLA transfer ownership function and identify any need for guidelines or changes to 1516.  Present HLA transfer ownership implementations and HLA transfer ownership logic will be examined.  Aggregation transfers, and a final review of the proposed HLA RPR FOM and GRIM changes needed to support the new DIS design,will also be addressed.   DIS and HLA transfer ownership projects havealready been completed or are underway by companies and DoD organizations.The TC SAG will continue to provide a "Transfer Control Help Desk" to assist software engineers in implementing transfer control and educating the community to its uses.  A final report is expected to be presented at the Fall 2004 SIW.    PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT GROUPSProduct Development Groups (PDGs) are approved to generate specific SISO Products (Standards, Guides, and Reference Products) after approval of a formal Product Nomination.  Current Product Development Groups include    Base Object Model Specification (BOM) PDGThe BOM PDG is developing a specification for Base Object Models.The open standardization of BOMs is essential for establishing component technology to facilitate interoperability, reusability and composability.  As part of this standardization effort, the PDG will define an XML schema to identify the base elements and ontology of a BOM and provide guidance describing how BOMs can be used to generate FOMs and SOMs from BOM compositions.    C4ISR/Simulation Interoperability Technical Reference Model PDG  U.S. and international military communities have identified interoperability between C4ISR and M&S systems as a high priority. This is reflected in the Army M&S Master Plan, the Air Force Distributed Mission Operations goals, the Navy and Marine Corps Aviation Simulation Master Plans, the Joint National Training Capability objectives, the DoD Training Transformation goals, and the NATO Modelling and Simulation Master Plan. A substantial amount of work is underway to address the myriad of issues related to interoperability. The issues range from coalescing an assortment of systems models to identifying levels of interoperability. The issues are further complicated by the variety of C4ISR and Simulation systems, and the often dissimilar needs of legacy, interim and future applications. The desire to satisfy both near and far term interoperability requirements poses a challenge when attempting to develop a solution for a specific application. The proposed product will provide guidance on these issues. The nominated product will provide design and development guidance for C4ISR/Simulation systems interoperability applications. The guidance document will target all those involved in the development process (management, procurement, engineering, end-user, etc.). It will serve as a tutorial for those new to the field, establish a common vocabulary, and provide visibility into the work being done by others.    Dynamic Link Compatible HLA API (HLA API) PDGThe HLA API PDG is developing a standard to define the requirements for Dynamic Link Compatible HLA APIs and methods for testing compliance.  This standard will be very useful to the distributed simulation community that uses the HLA and particularly useful to simulation developers that have to participate in multiple Federations sing different RTIs.  Use of the Dynamic Link Compatible HLA APIs will also support Federation managers in assembling Federates.  The PDG plans to define standard C++ and Java APIs for HLA1.3 which will be based on the current APIs.  Additionally, alternative C++ and Java APIs will be created for the IEEE 1516.1 APIs will be a SISO extension to the IEEE standard.    	Environmental Data Coding Specification (EDCS) PDGEDCS is a component of the Synthetic Environment Data Representation Interchange Specification (SEDRIS) that provides a data dictionary and coding standard for environmental data used in simulations of terrain, atmosphere, ocean, and space.HLA Evolved PDG The HLA has been in active use among many different classes of distributed simulation users since the mid-1990s.  IEEE 1516 represents the current commercial standard for the HLA.  As experience with the use of IEEE 1516 continues to grow, and as new technologies that affect HLA implementations are developed, it is necessary that the IEEE 1516 specifications be periodically evaluated and modified in order to meet the evolving needs of the user community.  Through a memorandum of agreement between the SISO and IEEE, the HLA Evolved PDG will develop revised versions of the HLA Rules, Interface Specification, and Object Model Template using the SISO Balloted Product Development Process (BPDP) and then ballot the revised standards through IEEE.    Link-16 Simulation Standard PDGLink 16 is one of the critical components of interoperability in the Allied forces.  There are immediate and overdue operational requirements for existing and future military simulations to exchange Link-16 data using a single interoperable standard. This group is developing a SISO standard to define the methods to simulate a Link-16 Network within Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) and High Level Architecture (HLA) frameworks.    Real-time Platform Reference FOM PDGVersion 1.0 of this Reference Federation Object Model was the first SISO standard, capturing the functionality of IEEE 1278.1-1995.  RPR FOM 2.0, currently under development, will add the functionality of IEEE 1278.1a-1998.    VV&A PDG (VV&A PDG)The VV&A PDG is developing a recommended practices guide outlining implementation methodologies for the VV&A of a federation.  IEEE 1516.3, Recommended Practices for HLA Federation Development and Execution Process(FEDEP) recognized VV&A as a key component of federation development and implementation to the extent that placeholders, or "hooks," were included in the FEDEP to support the developmoent of a VV&A overlay.  The proposed VV&A guidance document will mirror the FEDEP, addressing overall VV&A methodology, roles and responsibilities, tasks, and resulting products.It will be based on lessons learned and established approaches derived from the M&S community.  This guidance document will serve as the foundation for the assessment of credibility of a federation by addressing issues relating to establishing substantive interoperability, promoting reusability, and assuring composability.     INTERNATIONAL PROGRAM BRIEFINGSInternational and multi-national programs are invited to present brief reports on their current activities and plans.
