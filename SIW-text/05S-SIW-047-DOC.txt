We have extended their set of techniques and tools to support all seven steps of the REVVA generic VV&A process. Roughly speaking, this generic process permits to deal with “V&V in the large”, collecting of “V&V items” being only one of these seven steps. The support of the other six steps assumes a new perspective on VV&A and includes techniques for decision making, argumentation and other methods of collective sense making. The paper presents the approach of REVVA and the results which have been obtained at the end of the project.BackgroundUnder the umbrella of the Western European Armament Group's THALES Memorandum of Understanding, the JP11.20 project (nick named "REVVA") aiming at providing a "Common Framework for Verification, Validation, and Accreditation of Simulations" was carried out during the period from March 2003 through October 2004. Within the Joint Programme between Denmark, France, Italy, Sweden, and The Netherlands, a VV&A methodology was developed, which includes the REVVA Generic Process, a stand-alone VV&A process, which can be easily linked to numerous types of model development processes, including the development of distributed simulations.Introduction REVVA is founded on a number of concepts and ideas of which the most important are:  The concepts of Target of Acceptance (ToA) and Target of Verification and Validation (ToVV), which put a strong emphasis on V&V requirements definition, formalization of V&V planning, and traceability from the individual Items of Evidence acquired during V&V implementation up to the intended purpose of model use.The explicit distinction between the properties "correctness" and "validity", which are inherent to a simulation model on the one hand, and the processes of "verification" and "validation" to reveal them on the other hand. Hooks for the integration of methods for estimation of uncertainty introduced by the current inability to prove neither correctness nor validity. A role model, which clearly distinguishes technical and managerial roles and sides from which the actors may come.A demarcation of "worlds" related to or associated with modelling and simulation.The ToA and the ToVV are consistent with the documentation requirements defined in the International Test Operations Procedure on V&V (WGE7.2), and the complete methodology creates a stable framework for activities such as the NATO MSG019/TG016 "VV&A of HLA Federations".During the project a study was performed to identify and locate existing techniques and tools to support the REVVA Generic Process in the large. The study comprised an extensive review of techniques to support objective acceptance decisions. Taking the Recommended Practices Guides from DMSO as the point of departure many other military and civilian sources were investigated. The RPG Documents have borrowed their techniques and tools mainly from the M&S Software and Requirements Engineering disciplines and consequently address only a subset of the REVVA phases. We have extended their set of techniques and tools to support all seven phases of the REVVA generic VV&A process. Major contributions were fetched from the Decision Science Departments of Business Schools and from the Safety Engineering Industry.The paper presents the results of this study.The phases of REVVA VV&A processIn the following diagram of the REVVA process the grey boxes depict the phases of the process, and the ellipses represent products generated during each phase. The phases are normally carried out in the shown sequence, but depending on the intermediate results and findings you should expect loops and iterations as are also illustrated in the figure by the dashed lines. Phase 1, Develop ToA. A detailed set of acceptability criteria is developed based on the intended purpose of model use. It is helpful to distinguish between different types of requirements (including, e.g., availability of particular intermediate products, reuse of selected federates, operation on a particular computer platform and operating system), focusing on those as V&V relevant Acceptability Criteria, which exclusively address the model’s correctness and suitability. These are recorded as the “Target of Acceptance”, ToA. Phase 2, Acquire InformationKnowledge about the real system, its structure and behaviour, its subsystems and their structure and behaviour, or related systems is collected and filed under consideration of the intended purpose of model use and the detailed acceptability criteria, documented in the ToA. Also all relevant existing information about the model should be identified and made available for the following V&V activities. All acquired information about the real system and the model is placed in a common repository.Phase 3, Develop ToVVThe Target of V&V is developed based on the ToA and an overview over both the available model information and real system knowledge. For each criterion a strategy is developed, which points out how with the information at hand and the available technical means it can be demonstrated that it is passed or failed. The ToVV directs the conducting of the V&V activities and will be used for the assembly of the evidence. Phase 4, Conduct V&V The V&V Executioners plan and execute the V&V as required by the ToVV. They acquire evidence or create it by implementing the appropriate analyses or tests. Each test result, analysis report, or proof outcome is documented as an item of evidence.Phase 5, Assess EvidenceThe V&V Leader reviews each item of evidence gathered, created, or otherwise provided, consults his V&V Executioners, and assesses the probative force of each item of evidence. The assessed items of evidence serve as the atomic building block on which the acceptance decision later is based.Phase 6, Assess Evidence IntegrationThe V&V Leader assembles the approved evidence into the V&V report according to the ToVV.Phase 7, Evaluate V&V ReportThe Acceptance Leader estimates the residual uncertainty associated with the use of the model based on the probative force of the evidence, the rigor of the ToVV, and the selection of acceptability criteria. Preliminary notesThe crux of the matter for REVVA is whether the results of a simulation are useful. The use of a simulation is the central point for REVVA, not the development or implementation of the simulation. The latter points are still covered basically by Software Engineering disciplines. For REVVA a simulation will generally contain an uncertain mixture of valid and erroneous results, and the question is whether an intelligent decision may be based on these results. This question should be raised and answered in the same vein as a criminal case is being raised and answered in the jurisprudential world. Evidence should be collected, proven or falsified by V&V executioners, and the aggregated body of evidence finally ruled by the Acceptance Agent. Consequently our study, besides dealing with the traditional basic V&V techniques, searched for techniques that could complement these to support the “V&V in the large” scope of REVVA.  Basic V&V techniques and toolsBy these we understand the techniques and tools primarily inherited from the software engineering and M&S disciplines. They include Requirements Engineering and the many informal, static, dynamic and formal techniques for verification and validation that have so well been described in the RPG series of documents from DMSO [3], [4], [5], [6]. The basic techniques and tools are mainly supporting the first four phases of the REVVA process.Requirements EngineeringGood Requirements Engineering is mandatory for developing the ToA and the ToVV. The results of the collaborative European REAIMS project [13] are useful for these tasks. The aim of REAIMS was to develop new techniques and strategies for requirements engineering process improvement, particularly for safety-critical systems. The book by Sommerville and Sawyer on Requirements Engineering [14] consolidates the REAIMS results into good practice guidance with the following main topics:Practical process improvement The requirements document Requirements elicitation Requirements analysis and negotiation Describing requirements System modelling Requirements validation Requirements management Requirements engineering for critical systems System modelling with structured methods Formal specification ViewpointsWe have found that structured checklists (see e.g. [8]) are effective means for establishing a proper set of requirements. Checklists add structure to the validation process and it is therefore less likely that users or experts will forget to check some aspects of the requirements document. Questions which might be included in such a checklist should be based on the following general issues: Are the requirementscompleteconsistent comprehensibleambiguousdescribed in  a well structured document traceableconforming and documented to defined standards? Checklists should be expressed in a fairly general way and should be understandable by people such as end-users who are not system experts. As a general rule, checklists should not be too long.  “DMSO” techniquesThe RPG document on V&V techniques [5] lists 77 different techniques useful for phase 2 and 4 of the REVVA process.  The list is quite comprehensive and is an excellent resource for any V&V worker. Just two techniques have been added to the list by our study, viz. Multi Criteria Analysis and Design of Experiment (DOE).Multi Criteria Analysis, MCAA thorough introduction to MCA is given in the “Multi-criteria analysis manual”, written by a team of researchers at National Economic Research Associates, UK [7]. The main role of the MCA techniques is to deal with the difficulties that human decision-makers have been shown to have in handling large amounts of complex information in a consistent way. MCA techniques can be used to identify a single most preferred option, to rank options, to short-list a limited number of options for subsequent detailed appraisal, or simply to distinguish acceptable from unacceptable possibilities. Multi-criteria analysis establishes preferences between options by reference to an explicit set of objectives that the decision making body has identified, and for which it has established measurable criteria to assess the extent to which the objectives have been achieved. In simple circumstances, the process of identifying objectives and criteria may alone provide enough information for decision-makers. However, where a level of detail broadly akin to Cost/Benefit Analysis is required, MCA offers a number of ways of aggregating the data on individual criteria to provide indicators of the overall performance of options. Experimentation techniques, DOEWhenever possible data from real tests or experiments on the whole system or on subsystems should be obtained and compared with simulation results. It is wise to take time and effort to organise the experiment properly to ensure that the right type of data, and enough of it, is available to answer the questions of interest as clearly and efficiently as possible. This process is called experimental design. Design Of Experiments (DOE) is a powerful statistical technique for this purpose introduced by R. A. Fisher in England in the 1920's to study the effect of multiple variables simultaneously [9]. DOE was later further developed and improved by Genechi Taguchi, who carried out significant research with DOE techniques in the late 1940's. Dr. Taguchi's standardized version of DOE, popularly known as the Taguchi method or Taguchi approach [12], was introduced in the USA in the early 1980's and is today one of the most effective quality building tools used by engineers in all types of activities.Techniques and tools for V&V in the largeREVVA very early concluded, that to support the full set of REVVA phases, efficient techniques for argumentation construction and decision support were needed. This is especially true for the last three phases of the REVVA process.Argumentation techniquesThe more complex the M&S application of which a VV&A assessment report shall be produced the more it is important that the argumentation structure is clear and convincing. We have found interesting work on graphical and other argument support in the domain of safety studies and collaborative work. The University of York, UK, has been especially active in safety case research and led already in the early 1990’s the ASAM (A Safety Argument Manager) project [11]. The project based its approach upon the principals of structuring arguments in the Toulmin form (i.e. in terms of claims, warrants, backing, rebuttal etc.) [15]. These ideas were later further developed in the SHIP project, which was funded under the EU Environment Programme (Major Industrial Hazards). The objective of the project was to define an approach to assuring safety despite the presence of design faults. The SHIP model of argumentation is shown in the figure below. It defines the safety case in terms of three elements:Claims about properties of the system.Evidence used as the basis of the safety argument.Argument that links the evidence to the claims via a series of inference rules.The following three types of argument are defined:Deterministic – relying upon axioms, logic and proofProbabilistic – relying upon probabilities and statistical analysisQualitative – relying upon adherence to standards, design codes etc.Based on this research, Adelard LLP, UK, now offers the ”Adelard Safety Case Development Manual”, ASCAD that defines a generic approach, which is applicable across a wide range of technologies [2]. ASCAD has been much influenced by the thesis of Timothy P. Kelly [10], in which he argues that a safety case should present a clear, comprehensive and defensible argument that a system is acceptably safe to operate within a particular context. However, many existing safety cases, in their attempt to manage potentially complex arguments, are poorly structured, presented and understood. This creates problems in developing and maintaining safety cases, and in capturing successful safety arguments for use on future projects. Kelly’s thesis defines and demonstrates a coherent approach to the development, presentation, maintenance and reuse of the safety arguments within a safety case. This approach is based upon a graphical technique – the Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) –and has three strands. Firstly, a method for the use of GSN is defined together with an approach to supporting incremental safety case development. Secondly, the thesis presents a systematic process for the maintenance of a GSN-structured safety argument. Thirdly, the concept of ‘Safety Case Patterns’ is defined as a means of supporting and promoting the reuse of successful safety arguments between safety cases.Decision techniquesRegarding the customers desire to use the model for a given intended purpose, and under the assumption that correctness and suitability at the current state of the art cannot be proven, two possibilities can be identified for the acceptance problem:the model is fit for purpose;the model is not fit for purposeThe two decision alternatives are to accept or reject the model. The financial losses (any other metric, environmental, political, etc. may be used) associated with the two decision alternatives for the two different possibilities above can now be analysed and recorded according to the four different cases of the 2x2 matrix below:                    Fact:Perception:Factually validFactually invalidPerceived as valid (and accepted)Ok (case 1)Type II Error (case 3)Perceived as invalid (and rejected)Type I error (case 2)Ok (case 4)The analysis may be performed based on the resources allocated to model development, the expected acceleration or delay of the availability of results, and the reduction or increase of expenses caused by model use.Case 4 (factually invalid/rejected) shall be the foundation for the approach to estimation of model utility. In this case, financial loss is positive, based on a function of the development cost for the useless model and the time wasted. For case 1 (factually valid/accepted), financial loss is expected to be negative (gain), being calculated as the cost of developing the model and executing the simulation experiments minus the (estimated) cost of conducting the real experiments. The assumption that there is a gain is motivated by the assumption that no model is developed, if the estimated cost of model development and use is higher than the execution of the real experiments. Some real experiments, e.g. nuclear weapons, are impossible to perform. In this case, the gain is expected to be highly positive. For case 3 (factually invalid/accepted), the loss is expected to be positive, consisting of the expenses for model development plus the cost for fixing the damage caused by the use of the invalid model.In case 2 (factually valid/rejected), the loss is again positive, and calculated based on the expenses for the development of the unused model plus the cost that could have been saved by using the model.The decision tools available include:Cost/Benefit Analysis (CBA)Pareto AnalysisPaired Comparison Analysis Grid Analysis Decision TreesPlus/Minus/Implications (PMI)Force Field Analysis Six Thinking Hats Multi-criteria analysis (MCA)Future directionsBayesian Belief NetworksIn the thesis by Kelly [10] referred to above in section  REF _Ref93897633 \r 5.1 he suggests to integrate Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) with the Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) approach. Whereas GSN provides a means of presenting (essentially non-weighted) inferences between the claims of a safety argument, BBNs provide a means of deriving, modelling and quantifying the belief in the inferences between claims. Some initial thought was given to how these two techniques relate. This has led to the belief that a BBN used to derive a quantitative claim (from qualitative or quantitative evidence) has a corresponding GSN pattern. This pattern would present the ‘output’ claim supported by the ‘input’ claims of the BBN, justified by the causal links and the conditional probabilities given in the BBN. In the coming REVVA2 continuation of the REVVA project this strand of study should be pursued.REVVA VV&A ToolA tool that supports and documents the whole REVVA VV&A process should be developed. Based on the following table of VV&A product contents required by REVVA, this tool should provide standard templates for the four most important REVVA reports, the ToA, the ToVV, the V&V report, and the Acceptance Report.Element from the data model:ToAToVVV&V reportAcceptance reportActual costXActually used aggregationXActually used method for collecting evidenceXConstraintsXXXXConvincing forceXCost estimateXDecomposition argumentXXXXEvidenceXInstructions for aggregationXXLevel of impactXXXXLevel of residual uncertaintyXMethod to use for collecting evidenceXMoEXXXXObserved constraintsXXObserved effectivenessXPoint of contact for evidenceXXProbative forceXRequired rigorXRequirements (ToA level)Requirements (ToV level) Requirements (leaf-nodes only)XXXXX XXVersion control informationXXXX  Summary and conclusionWe have identified a number of techniques that complement DMSO’s RPGs to cover the full REVVA VV&A process. Still some research remains to locate operational techniques for evidence evaluation in the vein of jurisprudential science. A comprehensive tool to support all the seven phases of the REVVA process should soon be developed, preferably as part of the coming REVVA2 project. We plan to investigate whether this tool should comprise also a Bayesian Belief Network generator for the V&V argumentation tree.   ReferencesBishop, P.G., Bloomfield, R.E (1995).
