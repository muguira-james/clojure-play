Existing examples include the JSIMS EDM for Terrain and the DMSO Ocean and Atmosphere Requirements and Data Models (OARDM). EDMs are currently under development to support the OneSAF Objective System (OOS), several C4ISR systems, and EDMs have been reverse-engineered for legacy systems including the Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT) and the OneSAF Testbed. All of these EDMs have been based on the data dictionary defined by the Environmental Data Coding Specification (EDCS). They serve to promote interoperability among multiple systems, specify requirements for data content from authoritative providers and define the effects the environment may have on a simulation‚Äôs models of equipment and cognitive behavior.The DMSO Terrain Scenario Generation and Archiving (TSGA) project has developed an EDM for 3D models. The goal was to develop a sufficiently rich classification and attribution schema so that any 3D model from a variety of legacy model libraries could be unambiguously identified by its classification code and attribute values (instead of by the use of an arbitrary, but unique, name). These legacy libraries include the CCTT, STOW97, and several SIMNET model libraries. The existing EDCS classifications, attributes and enumerations were not sufficiently rich to meet our goal. Research was conducted into additional mechanisms for characterizing urban terrain zones, architectural styles, roof patterns, material codes, etc., which are important aspects of 3D Models used for visualization and reasoning in simulations. Based on this, additional classifications, attributes and enumerations were defined and have been proposed for incorporation into the EDCS. Using the extended EDCS as a basis, an extensive specification of 3D model classifications and associated attributions was developed. An accompanying design rationale document serves as a basis for future extensions of the EDM to support, for example, multi-spectral sensors and the representation of building interiors. To assign classification and attribute values to the many hundreds of 3D models in the legacy libraries, each model was manually inspected and classification and attribute values assigned and entered into a database. A SEDRIS application (the EDCS Attribute Adder ‚Äì EAA) was developed to read a model library STF, add and/or modify the classification and/or attribute values from the database, and then output a fully classified and attributed model library STF. Most of the resulting attributed 3D model libraries will be accessible via the Master Environmental Library in FY01, for unrestricted use in the M&S community.IntroductionIn recent years, formal environmental data models (EDM) have been used to specify the content of environmental databases for modeling and simulation (M&S) systems. Reference  REF _Ref503187212 \r [1] describes several such data models. Formerly, environmental data modeling had been ad hoc, with the data models captured only in implicit fashions such as in source code or data files, if at all. The Army Warfighter Simulation (WARSIM) 2000, a component of the Joint Simulation System (JSIMS), defined a Terrain Common Data Model (TCDM) for use throughout the JSIMS Alliance. The Army Synthetic Natural Environment (SNE) Science and Technology Objective (STO) has developed a Common Data Model Framework (CDMF) to promote the comparison of program specific EDMs and support the higher resolution requirements of the OneSAF Test Bed and the Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT). The Reference EDM which will ultimately result from the unification of these program-specific EDMs will provide an important infrastructure for achieving environmental interoperability within the community of land combat simulations. In a related activity, the Defense Modeling and Simulation Office (DMSO) is extending the CDMF concept from terrain to the ocean and atmosphere domains. Creating these EDMs for Ocean and for Atmosphere supports the overall goal of establishing a general Environmental Data Model composed of environmental sub-domain EDMs (terrain, ocean, atmosphere and space) from which user community Reference EDMs and program specific EDMs would be generated as profiles. This paper reports on an EDM of a slightly different nature, viz., an EDM for 3D models. We have restricted our domain to terrain-based, or ‚Äústatic‚Äù 3D models: buildings, bridges, towers, factories, warehouses, etc. Our intent is not to develop an EDM for a specific simulation system, but rather to develop a data model which can unambiguously describe all 3D terrain based models from a number of legacy simulation systems. These models will be discoverable via the Master Environmental Library (MEL)  REF _Ref503394905 \n \h [2]. Many of these models, developed for government use, will be placed in the public domain. Because of the classifications and attribution defined in the data model, automated mechanisms can be developed to support queries such as:Find a 3D model of a factory whose dimensions (H X L X W) are approximately 20 X 40 X 20 meters, predominant exterior colors are red and gray, has two smokestacks, produces chemicals, has various roof levels, a metal roof, and an exterior wall pattern of brick.The model returned from this query might look something like this:Our goal was to provide classifications and attribution for a large number of legacy static 3D models so that any model is uniquely identified by its classification and attribute values. This will support the discovery of models by automated means. The model libraries used for developing this data model include those from the Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT), Synthetic Theater of War (STOW 97), and databases developed by Lockheed Martin Information Systems of Newfoundland, Bosnia, Germany, Sweden, and other regions. All models in these libraries will be fully attributed according to this data model and converted to SEDRIS Transmittals. Enhancing the ability to ‚Äúfind the right model‚Äù in model archives is only one benefit of this EDM for static 3D models. A second benefit is the ability to specify in greater detail the characteristics of a new 3D model required by a system; characteristics not so specified can be treated as ‚Äúdon‚Äôt care‚Äù by the developers of the 3D model. This makes both specification and model acceptance testing more rigorous, and potentially reduces rework.This effort is part of the DMSO-sponsored Terrain Scenario Generation and Archiving (TSGA) project, which is part of the Integrated Natural Environment (INE) Program. The goal of TSGA is to produce reusable, freely available archives of cleaned feature and elevation data, integrated 3D terrain databases, and 3D model libraries in SEDRIS format which are discoverable and accessible through the MEL.Environmental Data Coding SpecificationA data model requires both semantics and syntax. The phenomena/features and attributes of the physical environment need unambiguous and agreed-upon meanings as well as a coding schema to support machine parsing. The Digital Geographic Information Exchange Standard (DIGEST) Feature and Attribute Coding Catalog (FACC)  REF _Ref503203043 \r \h [3], a NATO standardization agreement (STANAG 7074), was initially used as the language for the JSIMS TCDM. However, FACC does not fully cover the spectrum of environmental data now required in M&S applications. The Environmental Data Coding Specification  REF _Ref503203095 \r \h [4],  REF _Ref503203109 \r \h [5] (EDCS) was initiated as a part of the DMSO-sponsored SEDRIS project and will eventually provide a code for each object and attribute likely to be included in any simulation database describing the physical environment. The EDCS is becoming an international standard under processes established by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).The current EDCS Version 2.7 does not contain sufficient classification and attribute codes to adequately describe the 3D models in the subject model libraries. It does not contain attributes to describe wall and roof visual patterns and composition, location of primary entrance, number of floors, presence of observation decks and antennae, etc. TSGA has proposed significant extensions to the EDCS, which will be described subsequently.Our methodology for extending the EDCS was to first extract all EDCS Classification Codes (ECC) and EDCS Attribute Codes (EAC) which might potentially apply to 3D models. Then the models in the legacy libraries were examined to determine characteristics which were not adequately covered by the existing EDCS. Research was undertaken to ascertain whether other authoritative classifications exist which can satisfy these requirements. In some cases, e.g., Urban Terrain Zone, attributes were found and adapted to the EDCS coding system. In other cases, web searches provided images of real world structures which elucidated a latent requirement, e.g., an image of a military bunker suggested the need for an attribute specifying the number of antennae:A Consistent RationaleOne difficulty in developing any EDM is to ensure consistency: if two classifications (features) are similar, then the attributes associated with them should also be similar, and any differences need clear rationale. Tools such as spreadsheets and relational databases can assist in ensuring such consistency, but ultimately the decisions are based on analysis.First, the legacy 3D model libraries were examined and ECCs assigned to each model (requiring new classification codes in some cases).Some general ‚Äúrules of thumb‚Äù were developed to help ensure such consistency. The following non-exclusive classes of ECCs were defined:Vertical structuresVertical structures which are not buildingsBuildingsCommercial and industrial buildings and facilitiesAggregate features (multiple structures)Bridges and bridge spansIn general, all vertical structures receive the following attributes:CCC_Colour Code CategoryDGENDamage, GeneralFARFFront and Axis ReferenceHGT_Height Above Surface LevelLEN_Length / DiameterMCC_Material Composition CategoryNAM_NameOBV_Object VariantPOT_Point Object TypeSIC_Snow / Ice CategorySPROStructure Protection TypeWID_WidthIn addition, vertical structures which are not buildings receive an attribute of SMC_ (Surface Material Category) (buildings will receive a material category for the roof and walls, separately).Buildings receive all attributes of vertical structures plus the following:CTYPConstruction TypeDEP_Depth Below Surface LevelNA3_Classification NameNFLRNumber of FloorsNMEENumber of Entrances/ExitsOVDOverall Vertical DimensionPEL_Primary Entrance LocationRFPTRoof PatternRSMCRoof Surface MaterialSSC_Structure Shape CategorySSR_Structure Shape of RoofWAPTWall PatternWSMCWall Surface MaterialCommercial and industrial buildings and facilities receive all attributes of buildings plus the following:PRO_Product CategoryVSDHVehicle Storage Door, Primary, WidthVSDWVehicle Storage Door, Primary, HeightVSTAVehicle Storage AreaAggregate features (collections of structures) receive the attributes associated with its primitive features plus the following (if not already specified by its primitive features):CTYPConstruction TypeDEP_Depth Below Surface LevelFFA_Fuel Facilities AvailableNA3_Classification NameOVDOverall Vertical DimensionPRO_Product CategorySFA_Storage Facilities AvailableUSE_UsageUTZ_Urban Terrain Zone TypeVSDHVehicle Storage Door, Primary, WidthVSDWVehicle Storage Door, Primary, HeightVSTAVehicle Storage AreaRecognizing that foolish consistency is unjustifiable, these feature classes and associated attributes became guidelines to ensure consistent attribution. Exceptions were taken to nearly every one of these ‚Äúrules‚Äù, but with solid rationale, which has been documented in detail.This process defined a total of 84 current and new ECCs, and 60 current and new EACs. To support consistency of attribution application, a spreadsheet was constructed by creating a record for all 84 ECCs for each EAC, with a field indicating whether that ECC should have the EAC associated with it. Then all 84 X 60 = 5040 records were analyzed by the authors to ensure the attributes were consistently applied.  REF _Ref503210041 \h Table 1 lists the 84 ECCs used in this EDM for 3D models and provides an example of this analysis for the attribute RSMC (Roof Surface Material), a newly proposed EDCS Attribute Code. Shaded records indicate that RSMC does not apply to that ECC. The reader will note ECCs which do not have roofs (e.g., Haystack, Pipeline) do not receive the RSMC attribute, while those which do (e.g., City Hall, Warehouse), do. As a result of this exercise, significant changes (hopefully, improvements) were made to the initial data model derived from the original ‚Äúrules of thumb‚Äù.Table  SEQ Table \* ARABIC 1: Example showing to which ECCs Roof Surface Material (RSMC) Attribute Code appliesRig / SuperstructureAA040Aircraft WreckageAB003Burner / Flare StackAB020Oil / Gas RefineryAC045Piping ComplexAC047Industrial Works AC050Industrial BuildingAC075RSMCFactoryAC080RSMCOre RefineryAC115Power PlantAD010RSMCSubstation / Transformer Yard AD030Repair BuildingAE051RSMCCraneAF040Commercial BuildingAG010RSMCBankAG020RSMCRetail FacilityAG050RSMCShopping CenterAG060Public Inn / RestaurantAG070RSMCExplosive Mine - LandAH026Wire ObstacleAH038Underground BunkerAH060Command BunkerAH061RSMCMilitary Administration / Operations BuildingAH100RSMCOperational Training Structure (MOBA bldgs)AH150RSMCAdministration BuildingAH200RSMCCity HallAH210RSMCMunicipal HallAH211RSMCGuard Shack / Guard RoomAH268RSMCPost OfficeAH280RSMCMobile HomeAI025RSMCApartment HouseAI045RSMCBarracksAI050RSMCHouseAI070RSMCBarn / Machinery ShedAJ072RSMCHay StackAJ073TheatreAK165RSMCFishing Pier / Promenade PierAK190BuildingAL015RSMCShedAL019RSMCBuilt Up AreaAL020CemeteryAL030Dragon TeethAL060Grave MarkerAL090Tower (Non-communication)AL240Place of WorshipAL300RSMCHospital BuildingAL321RSMCSchool BuildingAL351RSMCStorage Bunker / Storage MoundAM060Storage TankAM070Water TowerAM080WarehouseAM100RSMCRailroad Storage / Repair StructureAN041RSMCVehicle BarrierAP041Service / Refueling Station (Motor Vehicle)AP070RSMCBridge SpanAQ045Bridge Tower / Bridge PylonAQ055Bridge PierAQ056Control TowerAQ060RSMCPipeline / PipeAQ113Pumping StationAQ116RSMCPipeline TerminusAQ117Parking GarageAQ142RSMCDepot TerminalAQ145RSMCDisk / Dish AntennaAT010Power Transmission LineAT030Power Transmission PylonAT040Communication BuildingAT050RSMCCommunication FacilityAT055Telecommunication Switching StationAT057RSMCTelephone-Telegraph Pylon / PoleAT070Communication TowerAT080Communication AntennaAT090Pier / Wharf / QuayBB190Maritime PlatformBD110Dam / WeirBI020Hydrographic LockBI030Ground Surface ElementDA010Large Isolated Rock, Boulder or Rocky FormationDB161Tree (Individual)EC032Bush / Shrub (Individual)EC033Aircraft HangarGB017RSMCHelicopter Landing PadGB030Airport TerminalGB090RSMCMunitions ObjectMH102EDCS ExtensionsProposed new ECCs are given in  REF _Ref503239764 \h Table 2.

Each ECC has an average of 24 attributes which apply. Three examples are shown in  REF _Ref506967181 \h Table 4.Table  SEQ Table \* ARABIC 4: Examples of attributes applied to classificationsEDCS Attribute AdderThe EDCS Attribute Adder (EAA) is a software application for adding EDCS attribution to an existing SEDRIS transmittal (STF). It was designed to be easily extensible to support modification of other data than attribute values. It leverages existing APIs and applications as much as possible. The EAA is compatible with SEDRIS 3.0 transmittals and utilizes the new ‚Äúupdate‚Äù capability of SEDRIS 3.0. A data flow block diagram is shown in  REF _Ref503276418 \h Figure 1.Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 1: EAA Data FlowThe EAA is an ANSI C-language application that operates on an existing input STF and results in a modified output STF. The SEDRIS read API is used to read the input STF, and the SEDRIS write API ‚Äúupdate‚Äù capability is used to write a new output STF. The software contains an option to make a copy of the input STF since the update capability modifies the input STF in-place.The application uses a previously (generally manually) filled out spreadsheet (Input Mapping Table) to assign ECC and EAC values to a retrieved model. Attributing Models from Legacy LibrariesIn total, 878 models have been fully attributed. This was largely a manual process; an analyst visually inspected each model, and utilized other information including the model file name and any other metadata available. Dimensional attributes were automatically generated.

For a number of legacy 3D model libraries, these specific classification and attribute values have been captured and inserted into STFs which are being made publicly available via MEL. These STFs contain complete geometry and texture data as well as the classification and attribution. STRICOM, under the Synthetic Natural Environment Science and Technology Objective (SNE STO), will be using the developed EDM and associated tools to capture, value-add, and populate additional STF-based libraries using models harvested from the Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT).As a requirements data model, it is expected that OOS will be able to use this to fully specify 3D models to be built and/or procured in a manner which is much less influenced by the vagaries of individual perceptions and subjective judgement, therefore allowing streamlined acquisition, testing and acceptance procedures to be applied.Currently, the dynamic terrain component of the Environment Federation uses EDCS classification and attribute values to instance models in the terrain database at runtime, and these classifications and attributes are specified in the Federation Object Model (FOM). A natural extension to this would be extend the Environment Federation FOM to include all classifications and attributes in the EDM for 3D models and to extend the software to find a model in the model library which most closely matches the specified description.While this effort was restricted to terrain-based "static" models, a follow-on effort addressing models of vehicles and equipment ("dynamic‚Äù models) has begun. In particular, there are nearly 10,000 vehicle and equipment types currently defined for Modeling and Simulation use in the Enumeration and Bit Encoded Values for Use with Protocols for Distributed Interactive Simulation Applications  REF _Ref506963167 \r \h [6] companion to IEEE Standards 1278.1-1995 and 1278.1A-1998. These vehicle types and the attributes describing them are not currently represented in the EDCS where they need to be in order to be used for attribution of dynamic models in SEDRIS transmittals. This work will address conversion of Entity and Bit Values data into a cohesive and reasonable set of EDCS classifications and attributes. In addition, SEDRIS Transmittals of dynamic moving model data that make use of the enhanced classification and attribution will be provided. This new work might eventually supplant the use of the Entity and Bit Encoded Values document as referenced in the Realtime Platform Reference (RPR) FOM.AcknowledgmentsThe authors wish to thank Juan Perez, who leads the DMSO INE Program and Nancy Gardner of the US Army Topographic Engineering Center, who is the COR for this contract.ReferencesD.
