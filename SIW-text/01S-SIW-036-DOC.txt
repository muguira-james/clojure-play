In the case of disaster rescue, for instance, a rescue team must rapidly and accurately handle information about the situation, environment, and objective.  The rescue team needs to determine which destination it should go to first, which road to should take, when to move, and how quickly. We developed a prototype of a federation of distributed semi-automated disaster rescue team models based on HLA. In this simulation, each model is a rescue vehicle that operates autonomously in the distributed environment. Models always move in pairs such as the advance party and the main body. Each model moves semi-automatically, receiving orders from the team leader. Among each pair, the advance party grasps situations, such as traffic jam, roadblock, etc., and sends collected data to the other party. A pair model goes to the destination through the best or shortest route. All information is also forwarded to the headquarters of disaster rescue. This information can then be accessed on request from each model. Each model can always grasp its surrounding situation and can change its rescue target depending on the situation. Visualization of current situation is provided on 2D and3D displays through the RTI. This paper describes the situational awareness, command, control, decision making and route planning tasks accomplished by the semi-automated models. It examines the potential for this new common environment to reuse architecture and the software parts. It also discusses analyzing the simulation results, and extending the rule set.1. IntroductionSimulation is utilized for making practical use of the available information and resources. In the case of disaster rescue, for instance, a rescue team must rapidly and accurately handle information about the situation, environment, and objective.  The rescue team needs to determine which destination it should go to first, which road to should take, when to move, and how quickly. In addition, in such a disaster rescue, the plans and potential problems can be explored in advance by using a simulation.  Often, this is indispensable to best utilize the existing resources. 2. BackgroundWe developed a prototype federation of distributed semi-automated disaster rescue models based on HLA. This paper describes the situational awareness, command, control, decision making and route planning tasks accomplished by the semi-automated models We will also describe the lessons learned in our study.3. Overview3.1 OverviewIn this disaster rescue federation, each model operates autonomously in a distributed environment. Each model should move to his destination as fast as it can. We built the logic of maneuver control, situation awareness, and route planning into our simulation to explore the technical feasibility and utility of using SAF to simulate rescue operations. The models we built are shown as follows. EMBED Visio.Drawing.6Figure 1Each rescue vehicle model is under a single rescue headquarters (HQ). These models always move in pairs such as the advance party and a main body. These two parties form a team. Each model moves semi-automatically, and receives orders from its team leader. In each pair, the advance party grasps situations, such as traffic jams, roadblocks, etc., and sends collected data to the other party. A pair of models goes to their destination using the best or shortest route. All collected information is also sent to rescue headquarters. This information can then be accessed on request by each model. Each model can always grasp its surrounding situation and can change its rescue target depending on the situation. This makes it possible to analyze the logic of command and control by studying the maneuver control, situation awareness, and route planning decisions of the rescue teams. Visualization of current simulated situation is provided on 2D and 3D displays through the RTI. 3.2 HardwareThe simulation was built using two PCs. One hosted the HQ federate, all of rescue vehicle federates (eight vehicles this time), and 2D situation display federate. The other hosted the 3D situation display federate. The 3D situation display federate is interlocked with the 2D-situation display federate.Table 1 provides specifications for each PC.Table 1PC1(for HQ, Rescue vehicle, 2D situation display )PC2(for 3D situation display )CPUPentium III 600MHzMemory384MBGraphicAccelerator BoardnVIDIA GeForce225M polygons/s80,000 pixels/sDisplay15 inches1024 by 768 dotwith speaker systemJoystickSideWinder Force Feedback ProO/SWindows 2000 ProfessionalHub100Base-TX, 8 channels3.3 Federation ArchitectureThe federation architecture is shown in Figure 2. HLA is used to interoperate one headquarters federate controlling the missions of eight SAF federates each simulating a rescue vehicle. Additionally the vehicles operate in teams of two, with one federate in each team serving as team leader. The federation also contains one 2D and one 3D display federate for Human Computer Interface (HCI) and visualization. EMBED PowerPoint.Slide.8Figure 23.3.1 SAF Model ArchitectureThe common SAF model architecture is shown in Figure 3.EMBED PowerPoint.Slide.8Figure 3The models have autonomous action, only by requiring that a destination be specified.  Figure 4 Rescue vehicle in 3D situation displayFigure 4 gives an idea of how the vehicles appear in the simulated terrain3.3.2 Rescue Vehicle InterfaceThe interface for directing the operations of a rescue vehicle is shown in Figure 5.EMBED Visio.Drawing.6Figure 53.3.3 Movement ModelThe movement model we used is shown in Figure 6. Current models are simple, however we will extend the movement model in the near future. EMBED PowerPoint.Slide.8Figure 63.3.4 2D Situation MapWe use 25m by 25m mesh in the 2D situation display. In rescue operations the roads are often damaged or destroyed in a number of places. Therefore, it is important to us to be able to model damage wherever it occurs. The damaged road segments are built in advance to support SAF verification or analysis runs. Additionally, to save CPU load, the specific areas of interest for a simulation scenario are made more detailed, while other road segments and terrain, such as mountains, cliffs, etc., at modeled at lower levels of resolution.  We currently use between 25m to 100m mesh for our simulation runs.EMBED PowerPoint.Slide.8Figure 73.3.5 Route PlanningEach rescue vehicle uses a route planning method that looks for the shortest or best route autonomously. It moves more quickly on improved roads and less quickly on the unpaved roads. This route planning algorithm uses two parameter values to access routes: Choose shortest routeChoose improved roadEach vehicle chooses its route depending on the comparative strengths of these two parameters. This allows a range of mixed route finding behavior if these neither parameter is set to dominate route planning decisions.  (a) Parameter:      (b) Parameter:      (c) Parameters       Shortest route       Improved road     Balance to        Dominates            Dominates            MediumFigure 8Routing is changed based on new information from other vehicles or new orders from HQ. It is possible to find a common routing rule by analyzing the vehicle movement behavior.3.3.6 2D/3D DisplaysVisualization is provided by 2D and 3D displays in this simulation. A camera icon is also used provided to allow the observer to adjust the viewpoint displayed. Current situation is available in both the 2D and 3D views  of the distributed environment.      (a) 2D situation display      (b) 3D situation displayFigure 94. ConclusionWe successfully built a prototype simulation federation for analyzing rescue operation command and control. We learned valuable lessons regarding SAF simulation and the logic of maneuver control situation awareness, and route planning. 5. Future PlansUsing this simulation, we will identify common architecture and software parts for reuse. We will also explore use of the simulation for analysis, and experiment with extensions to the rule set.  Specific near term investigations are planned to explore:	- Data refresh rates 	- RTI delay times	- CPU loads	- Joining time	- Stability 6.
