IntroductionThe JWARS simulation currently undergoing development and beta testing is designed to simulate all aspects of joint warfare at the theater and campaign levels.  Its development strategy is to represent all warfare functions needed for analysis internally, without relying on distributed capabilities linked by the High Level Architecture (HLA) or Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS).Although not originally envisioned to be used in an HLA Federation, JWARS, like all Defense Department simulations (with minor exceptions) is required to demonstrate HLA compliance using a test procedure managed by the Defense Modeling and Simulation Office (DMSO).  Current HLA-related efforts supported by the JWARS Program Office are twofold:To survey possible HLA applications that are both practical and useful from an analytical standpoint;To develop a JWARS Simulation Object Model (SOM) representing the full range of JWARS applications and to facilitate development of HLA applications using JWARS, and to demonstrate HLA compliance via the DMSO test procedures using that SOM.HLA Survey TaskThe HLA Survey Task consisted of a survey of potential hypothetical HLA federations consisting of JWARS and one of several other simulations.  This analysis concluded that several HLA federations were both practical from a development perspective and useful from an analytical perspective.  The analytical utility of a federation of JWARS and another simulation consists of situations in which analysts could use a federation of JWARS and another simulation where the other simulation represents a critical warfare function that an analyst might wish to model with greater detail and fidelity than JWARS can provide, and where JWARS can provide a campaign/theater level context for the other federate.  In situations in which both conditions exist, an HLA federation should be considered.Development of the JWARS SOMThe SOM Development Task consists of creating a JWARS SOM, in which all JWARS output elements (called “instruments” in JWARS parlance) are HLA interactions and JWARS data elements (generally several of which exist for each instrument) are HLA parameters, corresponding to each HLA interaction.The strategy of using existing JWARS nomenclature in building the JWARS SOM has the advantage of portraying the capability and nomenclature of the full range of the JWARS simulation to a potential federation designer, and hence can support many different types of federations.2. Results of the HLA Survey TaskIn June, 2000, the JWARS Office directed an analysis of the feasibility of using HLA to federate JWARS with other simulations.  The purpose of the survey was twofold:To determine if any widespread analytical problems or issues typically encountered by analysts using simulations could be effectively addressed by a federation of JWARS and another simulation;To examine the technical feasibility of a federation of JWARS and another simulation.The exit criteria for this survey were as follows:The simulation development and documentation of the “other” simulation must be mature enough to design a federation with JWARS;The “other” simulation must have HLA compliance demonstrated or expected in the near future via development of a SOM or Federation Object Model (FOM);Assistance from the “other” simulation’s Program Office or expert users could be expected in developing a federation with JWARS;A federation with JWARS could be expected to address short-term customer needs and JWARS Operational Requirements Document (ORD) requirements which focus on:Planning and execution;Force assessment;System effectiveness and trade-off analysis;Concept and doctrine development and assessment.JWARS or its partner in an HLA federation could provide added value to the other simulation.The survey focused on the first step of the DMSO Federation Development and Execution Process (FEDEP), the definition of federation objectives.3. Simulations Considered for HLA   Federation with JWARSThe JWARS Office provided a candidate set of simulations and topics to investigate for the development of an HLA federation, although the survey was not restricted to this list.  A partial list of simulations investigated with the possible objective of an HLA federation with JWARS is shown in Table 1.SIMULATION TO BE FEDERATED WITH JWARSPURPOSE/POSSIBLE OBJECTIVE OF FEDERATIONJoint Simulation System (JSIMS)Federation would allow training community to analyze different courses of action in JWARS and select courses for staff/command level training in JSIMS.Mobilization Capabilities Model (MOBCEM)Explicitly simulate prewar mobilization function in MOBCEM before theater/campaign function in JWARS.Extended Air Defense Simulation (EADSIM)Perform a selected critical function, Theater Ballistic Missile (TBM) engagements, at a higher level of fidelity in EADSIM than can be accomplished in JWARS and then use the EADSIM results to analyze the course of a longer term campaign in JWARS.Naval Simulation System (NSS)Allow NSS users to develop scenarios in JWARS to provide theater level context for NSS.Weapons Analysis and Lethality Toolset (WALTS)Model the effects of a nuclear, biological, and chemical  attack at a higher level of fidelity than is possible in JWARS and use the WALTS results to analyze the course of a longer term campaign in JWARS.JWARS“Break apart” JWARS and run mobility portion independently to allow analysis of mobility requirements to support analysis of simultaneous dual  campaigns or analyze mobility requirements to support one theater.Table 1.  Candidate Simulations for Consideration in                an HLA Federation with JWARS4. Study MethodologyThe methodology of the survey task was to use material in the public domain pertaining to each candidate federate partner to assess that partner against the exit criteria described above.  In some cases, program offices for the simulations or analysis familiar with the simulations provided informal assistance.  However, in no case was a formal commitment required (or offered) to provide development assistance in designing a federation.  Rather, requested assistance focused on the viability of developing a federation that would be useful in assessing analytical issues common and persistent in the real world.  Issues of cost in terms of time and manpower were not formally addressed by the survey task.5. Study ResultsThe general conclusion is that a federation of JWARS and another simulation can provide useful results in cases for which JWARS outputs are supplemented by complementary analysis from another simulation at a greater level of detail or fidelity.  Specifically:The “other” simulation can provide JWARS with additional detail or higher fidelity on selected high value problems.  JWARS can then utilize the results to show effects on a longer term campaign.  Hence, the scope of JWARS can be expanded.JWARS can provide the “other” simulation with campaign/theater level results for that simulation to use in a more detailed/higher fidelity engagement providing better context for that engagement. EMBED MSPhotoEd.3  Figure 1.  Summary of ResultsThe following sections represent a description of how the hypothetical federate partners listed in Table 1 above could interact with JWARS in an HLA Federation.5.1 Possible Federation of JWARS and EADSIMA Federation of JWARS and EADSIM would allow analysis of detailed TBM and air defense engagements (performed in EADSIM) in the context of a campaign/theater level conflict.  Using this federation, analysts could assess a conflict from beginning to end with a detailed analysis of each missile defense or air defense event.  Figure 2 depicts a potential approach to interactions between JWARS and EADSIM. EMBED MSPhotoEd.3  Figure 2.  Possible Federation of JWARS and EADSIM5.2 Possible Federation of JWARS and WALTSA federation of JWARS and WALTS would have the same logic as a JWARS-EADSIM federation.  Critical Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) functions could be performed in WALTS, with the balance of the theater/campaign conflict being modeled in JWARS. Figure 3 illustrates this type of a federation. EMBED MSPhotoEd.3  Figure 3.  Possible Federation of JWARS and WALTS5.3 Possible Federation of JWARS and MOBCEMThe JWARS development strategy is to include integrated logistics/mobility analysis.  However, a federation of JWARS and MOBCEM would allow use of a more detailed analysis of logistics and mobility considerations than is possible in JWARS alone.  Hence, this federation might be useful if the specific additional capabilities in MOBCEM were required.  Figure 4 shows how a Federation of JWARS and MOBCEM would operate. EMBED MSPhotoEd.3  Figure 4.  Possible Federation of JWARS and                MOBCEM5.4 Possible Federation of JWARS and JWARSA federation of JWARS and JWARS would consist of three federates, two of which would simulate simultaneous different conflicts and a third which would simulate the JWARS logistics and mobility functionality, and which would allow analysts to explore how to allocate materiel between the two conflicts.  Figure 5 shows how this Federation would operate. EMBED MSPhotoEd.3  Figure 5.  Possible Federation of JWARS and JWARS5.5 Possible Federation of JWARS and JSIMSA federation of JWARS and JSIMS would allow command and staff level training in JSIMS based on specific courses of action that would be simulated in JWARS.  It would also allow JWARS to simulate different courses of action that were determined by or influenced by human operators being trained in JSIMS.  This federation is assessed to be a difficult one to implement, given the detail and scope of both JWARS and JSIMS.  Figure 6 illustrates the concept of a JWARS-JSIMS Federation. EMBED MSPhotoEd.3  Figure 6.  Possible Federation of JWARS and JSIMS5.6 Possible Federation of JWARS and NSSA federation of JWARS and NSS would allow a joint/theater conflict to be simulation in combination with a detailed portrayal of naval operations as portrayed by NSS.  This Federation is shown in Figure 7. EMBED MSPhotoEd.3  Figure 7.  Possible Federation of JWARS and NSS6. SOM Development and Implications for Developing HLA Federations with JWARS Because the effort to identify possible JWARS HLA Federations and demonstrate JWARS HLA compliance does not include any specific federation design, the strategy in developing a JWARS SOM was to include all JWARS functionality and to preserve as much JWARS language and structure as possible.  Hence, the SOM capitalizes on the existing JWARS outputs used in the primary analysis application.  These parameters, called instruments within JWARS, reflect the internal representation of the simulated virtual battlefield at the JWARS aggregate level.The database of instruments provides a description of each instrument, the attributes which make up the instrument, and their data types.   The SOM being developed based on these JWARS instruments is being used for HLA compliance testing of JWARS.  When started in RTI mode, JWARS joins the federation as an unconstrained, time-managed federate for this test. One issue was how to map these constructs to HLA Objects and Interactions.  The operating mode anticipated does not involve simultaneous execution of JWARS and the other members of the federation.  In this context the outputs from JWARS represent a pulse that sets the other federates in a tactically correct starting point.  Viewing instruments as management commands to the other federates, the authors chose to implement them as Interactions with Parameters in HLA.  Similarly, the data elements within each instrument are defined in terms of HLA-constant atomic types so it was not necessary to build complex data types for collections of data elements.Software was written to translate the instrument database into .omt format.  This is a straightforward set of text manipulations to produce a syntactically correct Parameter Table, filling in necessary fields with proper defaults.  The resulting .omt table was inserted into an .omt file and then read into the DMSO Object Model Development Tool (OMDT).  Three or four inconsistencies were detected by the tool and were easily fixed.  The result is a SOM for sending all the standard JWARS output instruments to the members of an HLA federation as interactions.  Existing JWARS interfaces can be used to set up the problem and trigger the output of instruments as necessary to accomplish the desired federation execution.The JWARS simulation system is built using a “kernel” approach.  The JwSimulationSystem class holds all the simulation objects.  The HLA-RTI interface for JWARS is a layer inserted in the class hierarchy above the simulation system as shown in Figure 8.   This allows the JWARS simulation to run with or without federation participation by setting a single flag in the initialization file settings.  The instruments are all collected by the data collector that has been modified to detect the presence of a federation and publish all the instruments as well as perform its normal data collection function.  Using a federation management tool like hlaControl™, the JWARS federate interacts by creating initial instances, enabling time management and performing initial time synchronization as shown in Figure 9.  This  triggers JWARS instruments.  These outputs go into the normal JWARS output files, and are also sent as time tagged Interactions to any other members of the federation.Figure 8.

Caveats and ConclusionsIn assessing the utility of a federation of JWARS and another simulation, a potential federation designer must balance the tradeoffs of analytical utility with runtime considerations.  It is not possible to estimate runtime considerations or conduct tradeoff analysis of the utility of a federation versus using JWARS and other simulations in a stand-alone mode unless a more detailed analysis is conducted.  However, given the analytical utility of HLA federations of the type described above and given the development of a JWARS SOM representing the full range of JWARS capabilities, further research into the utility of JWARS federations with other simulations should be conducted.Author BiographiesRICHARD BERNSTEIN Is a Senior National Security Analyst at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.
