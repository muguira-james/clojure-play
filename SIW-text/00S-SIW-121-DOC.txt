IntroductionIn advanced distributed simulations, the simulated “natural environment” provides the context in which synthetic forces will operate, locating those forces with respect to each other and mediating their interactions. The synthetic natural environment (SNE) encompasses all physical aspects (both state and effects) of the natural environment, including the land, sea, atmosphere, and space. Modeling the complex effects of the natural environment on the warfighter, however, requires prioritizations and trade-offs that can result in inconsistent and reduced fidelity representations across simulations. Inconsistent representations can occur for several reasons: use of different models, use of different databases, or use of different implementations of either or both.Reduced fidelity representations result from suboptimal employment of environmental effects models. Environmental effects models often involve complex algorithms to represent effects of the environment on some process such as the propagation of energy or the passage of a vehicle over a land or sea surface. In situations where environmental effects models (e.g., energy propagation models) must be run frequently to keep pace with changing circumstances (e.g., movement of sources and sensors), the computational complexity of the models requires a disproportionately large share of the available computer resources. To reduce the number of required calculations and improve model cost effectiveness, estimates of model output may be employed to replace actual model calculations. Currently, however, the rules used to determine whether to calculate or to estimate are often rather crude, based only on reducing the number of model calculations to an affordable size.  There is a need for a more comprehensive means of deciding whether to calculate or estimate based on knowledge of the model response to environmental conditions. The basis for this decision must include discrimination between those conditions for which estimates will be reliable and those conditions for which estimates will be poor.  In the latter case, actual model calculations must be made.The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Advanced Simulation Technology Thrust (ASTT) Program Multiresolution Interaction Validity (MIV) project was a 2½-year effort, aimed at developing a prototype methodology as well as prototype guidance products to support the enhanced representation of environmental effects in networked computer simulations. Specifically, the project focused on improving the capability to represent environmental effects on the propagation of energy affecting sensors in simulations by employing the prototype methodology to develop: Strategies for improving computational efficiency by determining the conditions for which an environmental effects model calculation must be performed or the conditions for which one or more alternative methods may be exercised to estimate that model’s output response;Abstractions of the response of a given energy propagation model to environmental features to guide developers of synthetic force models;Consistency analysis for evaluating correlation of environmental effects models across networked simulations.Earlier papers (References [1] and [2]) provide a detailed description of the MIV project approach and preliminary results. In addition, we have since made substantial progress in the employment of the cluster analysis technique as a major component of the prototype methodology, as detailed in a related paper (Reference [3]). This technique is an effective means of rapidly describing the range of propagation model behavior in response to conditions associated with the natural environment for a particular geographic area and time of year.  We were then able to generalize these results reasonably well, so as to develop MIV products with application to a wider variety of conditions within a particular environment and beyond to a variety of types of environments.  These products include the energy propagation model use strategy development, model-dependent environmental abstractions (MDEAs) of the energy propagation model, and consistency analysis.  In addition, the methodology developed and implemented within MIV can be adapted to a variety of different simulation scenarios and implementations.  Following a brief summary overview of the project, this paper will detail the culmination of our efforts and present each of the developed products and the accompanying methodology.2.	Project OverviewAs an approach to a more general solution to the requirements for model cost effectiveness and improved consistency, the Multiresolution Interaction Validity (MIV) project was undertaken to develop and evaluate prototype methodologies to identify important environmental effects model sensitivities. These methodologies were to be generated for applicability in multiple environmental domains, but they were developed initially in the ocean acoustic domain to test specific applicability and utility and support the development of prototype products for enhanced consistency and model cost effectiveness. Later, these methodologies would be extended to applications in other environmental domains.Briefly, the MIV project developed a prototype analysis methodology for describing the response of a given energy propagation model to environmental features. The results of the analysis methodology can be used in turn to support the development of guidance products for enabling enhanced representations of environmental effects on energy propagation in simulations. For the purposes of this project, an analysis methodology is defined as an integrated application of techniques for comparison, analysis, and evaluation of the output response of an environmental effects model to environmental and operational input data. The prototype methodology was developed for applicability in multiple environmental domains, but it was developed initially in the ocean acoustic domain to support the development of prototype products. Later, this methodology will be extended to applications in other environmental domains as appropriate.A conceptual model of the MIV analysis methodology is presented in Figure 1.1. The MIV approach begins with the selection of a “real-world” environment, a specific littoral area, that will be the basis for environmental inputs to an environmental effects model. This project began by focusing on the effects of the ocean on the propagation of underwater sound. ASTRAL, a Navy-standard acoustic propagation model currently employed by the Navy training community for littoral environments, was selected as the first environmental effects model for this work. The selected real-world environment was examined for critical environmental factors that have important effects on the environmental effects model output (e.g., fronts eddies, surface mixed layers, seamounts, etc.). This environment was then simplified into various reduced complexity forms including a Baseline Environment (e.g., a horizontally uniform, isotropic ocean with the same sound velocity profile, bottom depth, and bottom characteristics everywhere); several Intermediate Synthetic Natural Environments (ISNEs), each consisting of a different single environmental feature added to the Baseline Environment; several ISNEs, each consisting of a different pair of environmental features, and so on, progressing toward the real-world environment with all of its characteristic features. Each of these environments became an input dataset for ASTRAL, along with inputs representing operational factors such as source and sensor locations, and source frequency.  The ASTRAL model was then run for a range of operational parameter values that covers the set of all anticipated conditions that might occur for a given simulation. The methodologies (cluster analysis, visualization, differencing) were applied to the resulting data sets of model output  (or model “responses”), and the results form the basis for the development of the MIV products.  The products are model use-strategy, model-dependent environmental abstractions (MDEAs), and consistency analysis.  These products are defined and, along with the analysis methodology leading to their development,  further discussed in the sections below.3.	Products and Analysis MethodologyGeneral Analysis MethodologyThe littoral area we inspected that appeared to contain the most features was the Sea of Japan (SOJ). Bathymetric features found in the Sea of Japan include continental shelf, slope, rise, and abyssal plain sequences, a spreading ridge, and seamounts.  Oceanologic development of water column features is affected by the small size of the basin, but shallow fronts and surface mixed layers were identified.   A map of the selected study area, showing the location of the studied environmental features, is provided in Figure 3.1.Figure 3.1 Environmental Feature Identification within theSea of Japan Study AreaIn addition to the area and features shown above, an area in the Northwest Atlantic, near the Gulf Stream, was also investigated, so as to obtain eddies and additional front features for the analysis. Princeton Ocean Model (POM) data sets for the Sea of Japan were available from the Naval Research Laboratory, Stennis Space Center, MS (M. Carnes, personal communication). The area covers the region from 127E to 142E and 34N to 52N, and were used as the oceanographic inputs to the ASTRAL model. US Navy standard databases for bathymetry and bottom-loss were also used to generate the input data.In addition to the environmental inputs to the model,  operational parameters (17 source/target depths, 17 receiver depths, and 26 frequencies), deemed reasonable for a typical simulation, were selected to complete the model input requirements.  In all, over 70 ISNEs were examined during the investigation, yielding over 500,000 calculation results to analyze.  Cluster analysis (References [4] and [5]), a multivariate statistical procedure for detecting natural groupings in data, was applied to the ASTRAL output data, and was instrumental in identifying regions within the input parameter space for which the ASTRAL output results are very similar.  These groupings, or clusters, result in sets of objects, such as transmission loss (TL) curves, that are similar to each other.  For a given ISNE, each combination of source/target depth, receiver depth, and frequency was identified as belonging to (or “mapped” into) a particular cluster.  An example of 2 clusters from a specific ISNE analysis is provided in Figure 3.2.  In the example, the population sizes are also indicated; in this case, there were quite a few more “similar” curves in the “red” cluster than in the “blue” one.  However, the similarities within each cluster, regardless of individual population size, are quite evident.Figure 3.2 Example of  Typical Cluster Analysis Results(2 Clusters Shown)Within each of the cluster populations, there is a single curve which is most like the other curves; this is identified as the “representative curve”.  The representative curves for the 2-cluster example shown in Figure 3.2 are presented in Figure 3.3.  Note that the representative curves are actual curves and not a composite or “mean” of curves within the cluster. Figure 3.3 Representative Curves for the 2 Clusters of Figure 3.2 shown in their Corresponding ColorsAn investigation of the parameters of the individual cluster elements provided some interesting characteristics of  the results from each ISNE. The two clusters whose TL curves are shown in Figure 3.2 represent separate and distinguishable simply-connected volumes in the three dimensional source-/target-depth/receiver-depth/frequency space.  The volumes corresponding to the two clusters are shown in Figure 3.4, which shows the locations of the clusters in the three dimensional parameter space. The circles represent the locations of the original TL curves in the three dimensional space and the lines project vertically from the circles down to the source/target depth - receiver depth plane. The grouping within the volume demonstrates that the cluster analysis can find volumes in the three dimensional source/target depth/receiver depth/frequency space within which TL characteristics are similar.Figure 3.4   Locations in Input Parameter Space whose Curves are  Illustrated in Figure 3.2, Shown in their Corresponding   Colors (Circles represent locations of the TL curveswithin the three dimensional  parameter space)The volume in the three dimensional parameter space occupied by the cluster population is characterized by a “cluster mapping”. This consists of the assignment of the combinations of input parameters of the population to their particular clusters, as well as the specific parameter values for the representative curve for that cluster.  The “cluster mapping” proved to be an essential ingredient to the successful characterization of the TL responses in a tractable way.In using the cluster analysis technique, a measure of the “accuracy” of the technique has been established, based on the mean Euclidean distance of  the individual TL curves within the cluster from the single representative TL curve.  The technique assures that the representative TL curve is “closest” to the curves in its cluster, providing the minimum “error”, if you will, for a given number of clusters.  The more clusters there are, the more accurate the mappings, as individual cluster populations get smaller and closer to their respective representative curve.  Figure 3.5 is a plot of the weighted (by the number of curves in each cluster) mean Euclidean distance over all clusters as a function of the number of clusters desired in the analysis.  The curve drops nearly exponentially from a very large number if one cluster is desired (all of the output TL is in the same single cluster) to smaller and smaller values as the number of clusters increases. Figure 3.5 Mean Euclidean Distance of All Clusters from their        Representative TL Curve as a Function of Number of        Clusters in the AnalysisThe results of the cluster analysis clearly has indicated that there were distinct regions within the parameter space within which the model outputs were very similar in structure.  Finding and exploiting those similarities was key to the development of the 3 MIV products – model use-strategy, model-dependent environmental abstractions (MDEAs), and consistency analysis.3.2	Model Use-StrategyThe development of more computationally efficient representations of environmental modeling was to be accomplished through the development of a model use-strategy.  A model use-strategy is defined as the conditions for which an environmental effects model calculation will be performed or the conditions for which one or more methods will be exercised to estimate that model’s output response. “Conditions” refers to the degree of model sensitivity to input parameters in a given region of the input parameter space. Use-strategy is developed from analysis of the model response for input parameter intervals within which the model output may be reliably estimated using other than direct calculation techniques. In any event, the objective of the use-strategy is to reduce the number of transmission loss calculations required for a simulation while preserving the acoustic characterization of the area.  The idea is to capture the parts of the input parameter space (source/target depth, receiver depth, and frequency) where the TL is changing rapidly.  The intent then is to identify those parts of the input parameter space which require more TL calculations (i.e. those parts where TL is changing quickly) and those parts of the parameter space where fewer TL calculations are required (i.e. those parts where TL is changing more slowly).There are two main use-strategy approaches.  One approach is to show the simulation developer the variability in TL as a function of the various input parameters: source/target depth, receiver depth, frequency, and range.  The developer is then able to select where TL needs to be calculated based on the amount of variability.  This approach uses several graphics to show the variability of  TL as a function of the input parameters.   Multiple levels of aggregation allow the developer to view TL sensitivity at various levels of detail.  The other use-strategy approach is to provide specific guidance for choosing the parameters for acoustic model inputs.  This approach uses the cluster mappings directly.  TL results for each environment were grouped using cluster analysis techniques.  The representative curves and the cluster mappings were used to describe TL behavior for a given environmental feature (ISNE).  Once the appropriate cluster mapping has been determined, only the representative TL curves need to be calculated.  All use-strategy results employ only the representative TL curves.The first use strategy product examines TL sensitivity to source/target and receiver depth changes.  Representative TL curves are used to describe the TL spanning the entire parameter space.  In the ensuing example, 25 representative curves were used to represent all 7514 combinations of source/target depth, receiver depth, and frequency for a given ISNE.  Accuracy analysis has shown that for these products, the 25 representative curves retain all the essential information required to examine the sensitivity of  TL  to the different input parameters.	At each frequency, the subset of representative curves corresponding to the source/target and receiver depth combinations were used in the analysis.  The representative curve with the lowest overall transmission loss is designated as the reference curve for that frequency.  The Euclidean distance is calculated between the reference loss curves at that frequency.  The reference curve is a way of normalizing the transmission loss across frequencies.  Since TL varies greatly as a function of frequency, it was necessary to normalize the TL if one wanted to examine source depth and receiver depth sensitivities to TL across frequencies.  Once the frequency dependence of TL has been removed, it is possible to average the Euclidean distance for a specific source and receiver depth across several frequencies.  Figure 3.6 shows the source and receiver depth sensitivity of TL for the frequencies from 6.4 to 10 kHz for a particular environment in the Sea of Japan (the slope/rise/front ISNE).  Figure 3.6  ASTRAL  Transmission Loss Variability forFrequencies from 6.4 kHz to 10 kHzThe areas of the plot where the colors are changing quickly indicate where TL is changing quickly as the source/target and receiver depths change.  The large blue area in the lower right hand corner shows that on average, for these frequencies, there is little TL variability when the source/target and receiver depth are both deeper than 250 feet.  The sudden transition from the gold to the green to the blue on the top of the figure shows that for constant receiver depths deeper than 200 feet, TL changes quickly as the source depth changes in the top 200 feet.Averaging over several frequencies can hide some important TL sensitivities at specific frequencies.  There is another display which shows the range of Euclidean distances at a particular source/target-receiver depth combination over a range of frequencies.  This display (not shown) enables the developer to observe how the TL varies over several frequencies for specific source-receiver depth combinations.  The developer would then be able to examine similar figures at individual  frequencies for more specific guidance.The sensitivity of TL to both frequency and range is examined in Figure 3.7, which shows the mean transmission loss for the same environment shown above (slope/rise/front ISNE).  Since the dependence of TL on frequency is one of the aims of the analysis, there is no normalization of TL as a function of frequency.  The TL values for a particular frequency and range were averaged together over all combinations of source/target and receiver depth.  In order to examine the distribution of TL values for any particular frequency and range, the standard deviation and spread in TL values were also calculated.  As before, only the representative TL curves were used.Figure 3.7 Dependence of  ASTRAL Transmission Loss on   Frequency and Range, Averaged Over All Source        Depths and Receiver DepthsThese mean values were calculated from the 25 representative curves.  One can see how at longer ranges (greater than 50 nmi), the TL varies greatly as the frequency changes.  Also, one can see how the TL generally increases as the range increases.The use-strategy also includes specific guidance as to where in the input parameter space TL calculations should be made.  Cluster mappings enable the developer to minimize the number of calculations required in either pre-calculating TL or calculating TL as the simulation evolves.  Analysis has shown that three cluster mapping are adequate for the Sea of Japan features and environment.  The choice of mapping is driven by the bathymetry:  deep plain, ridges, and shallow plain areas.  Recall that the cluster mappings define the parts of the source depth/receiver depth/frequency parameter space with similar TL.  The representative TL curve for each cluster adequately describes the TL behavior for each of the source/target depth/receiver depth/frequency combinations in that cluster.  Environmental data (i.e. sound speed, bathymetry, bottom conditions) would be extracted from databases and then TL would be computed for the representative loss curve input parameters.  The number of required groups (or clusters) can be determined from required accuracy (as shown in Figure 3.5).  Fewer groups are required if less accuracy is needed and more groups are required if more accuracy is needed.  Fewer groups would also be needed if the simulation addresses only a portion of  the input parameter space.Cluster maps applied to similar environments will not have the same accuracy obtained by using their own mappings, but the resulting accuracy appears adequate. Figure 3.8 shows the results of applying a cluster mapping calculated from one deep water environment (the baseline ISNE) in the Sea of Japan to other similar environments (ISNEs) in the Sea of Japan.Figure 3.8  Accuracy Curves Resulting From Application of the                   Baseline Mapping to Other Similar EnvironmentsThe figure shows the accuracy of the cluster mapping as a function of the total number of clusters used.  Once the total number of clusters is greater than 20, the overall error for all other deep water environments examined varies from 2 to 4 dB.  Increasing the total number of clusters to 50 lowers the overall error to 1 to 3 dB.3.3	Model-Dependent Environmental Abstractions (MDEAs)Each of the clusters is composed of TL curves whose input parameter interval constitutes a subset of the total input parameter space  within which the model behavior is similar so as to be described by the single representative TL curve associated with that particular cluster.  If a relatively small number of clusters can be found, in which the representative curves describe the entire range of  TL behavior exhibited across all of the ASTRAL TL results, then a viable “abstraction” of the ASTRAL results can be constructed.  It would necessarily be “model-dependent” as it has been developed via cluster analysis of model-specific (in this case, ASTRAL) TL results.  These results offer the potential for supporting the development of abstractions of ASTRAL response to specific environmental features.Model abstractions for use by synthetic force model developers have come to be called model-dependent environmental abstractions (MDEAs). They are defined as qualitative, model-dependent descriptions, developed by an SME with input from the MIV analysis methodology, of the effects of a specified environmental feature on the output response of a given environmental effects model (Reference [6]).Within each cluster, the TL curves have a specific source/target depth, receiver depth, and frequency associated with them.  The set of all of these three parameters, associated with all of the TL curves in a given cluster, has been termed the “cluster mapping”.  The set of TL curves within the cluster is called the “cluster population”.  The mapping provides a quick and  methodical way of identifying those portions of the parameter space within which the model responds similarly for the chosen environmental input (feature type). The population provides a quantitative view of the resulting TL curves, establishing the representative curve as the “best” estimate of TL for the parameters contained within the mapping.  Using the combination of cluster population and cluster mapping, for a desired number of clusters, results in a model dependent environmental abstraction of the TL results. The abstraction derives from the use of the representative TL curves as characterizing the totality (for the range of parameters specified) of the TL behavior, with the mapping indicating the appropriate representative curve to use for a particular combination of the 3 input parameters.  The results are also specific to the feature type or environment processed.In the Sea of Japan, the model was more sensitive to the bathymetric features, viz., the ridge , shallow plain or shelf, and continental slope, than to the oceanographic features.  However, there were still subtle differences in the resulting mappings and populations for each individual feature type.   Further analysis of most of the features revealed some interesting patterns, particularly within similar feature types.  In all, it was observed that three mappings would appropriately cover the entire range of TL behavior within the region.  These three were the deep (abyssal) plain, the shallow plain (shelf), and the ridge. Applying one of these mappings to the TL data from each of the individual feature types, generally associated with one of these three types, resulted in “errors” (the mean of the Euclidean distances observed within each cluster for the total number of clusters specified) not appreciably larger (.5-1 dB) than those obtained by using the mappings attributed to the individual feature types.  This result strongly suggested that the effects of the features on TL, for the Sea of Japan region, were quite generalizable.Using the set of mappings from one of these three types, and identifying the locations of the feature types within the Sea of Japan, a general environmental acoustic characterization of the area might be accomplished.  Using this methodology, the feature characterization for the Sea of Japan was generated and appears in Figure 3.1.  In it are identified the general locations of the major features investigated during this study.  Selecting a propagation path in or through one or more of the features, using the environmental data along that track as input to the ASTRAL model, selecting the appropriate mapping, and generating the TL using the parameters of the representative curves for a given number of clusters will result in a very general characterization of the TL that can be expected in or around that particular region.  While the three mappings mentioned earlier appear to suffice to characterize the model response to the features investigated, the actual TL results are fairly unique to a given propagation path (although TL within the same region will generally look similar for proximate paths).  Recognizing that the water masses and the specific details of the bathymetric features contained in the Sea of Japan vary with geographic location (i.e., colder water masses to the north of the polar front, warmer to the south of it; different angles of ascent/descent on a particular continental slope, etc.), a more “discrete” feature identification can be applied to the area.One of the possible feature identification schemes is depicted in Figure 3.9.  In it are 5 different regions of continental slope conditions, 4 regions characterized as deep plains, 2 regions identified as shallow plains, and 2 areas of the polar front. Figure 3.9  Feature Characterization Within Sea of JapanThe specific boundaries are somewhat arbitrary, as are the total number of subdivisions.  However, a study of the water mass structure as well as the bathymetric details would result in a similar breakdown.  In general, the larger the number of subdivisions, the better the TL characterization for any specific propagation path.  However, even a few such paths should provide a reasonable view of the TL expected throughout the area.The final step in the MDEA process is to determine and assign specific mappings (1 of the 3 classes) to propagation paths traversing in and across the subdivision boundaries.  A matrix of feature types, based on identified subareas, can be created.  Identifying a possible propagation path by the region it originates in (source location) and the region it terminates in (receiver location), a mapping can be selected for it based on the specific feature(s) encountered along the path.  A suggested matrix of such mappings is provided in Figure 3.10.   The matrix elements contain the mapping to be applied to the TL computed using the environmental information along a selected track from one feature region to another.  Realizing that the bathymetric features influenced the TL more than the oceanographic ones, in the Sea of Japan, provides a mapping hierarchy to employ when more than 1 feature is encountered along the propagation path.  As stated at the bottom of the matrix, denoted with an asterisk, the ridge mapping should be applied to all paths that contact the ridge in some way, regardless of the other features encountered in the same path.  The shallow plain is next in the hierarchy, but is applicable to a narrower portion of the matrix.  Finally, the bulk of the paths can be characterized by using the deep plain mapping.Figure 3.10 MDEA Feature Matrix for Sea of JapanTo implement the MDEA discussed here, the following steps are required: 	Locate endpoints of propagation path (geographically)             on feature identification chart (e.g., Figure 3.9)  Note features encountered along propagation path  Locate initial and final features along path in the feature matrix (e.g., Figure 3.10)   From the matrix, obtain relevant mapping 	Select/generate TL curves appropriate to the propagation path, using  the  n-cluster curve parameter setUse TL curve for specific source depth/receiver depth/frequency combination based on selected parameter-space mappingIt should be pointed out that this abstraction works for either pre-calculations or  for calculations done in near-real time.The MDEA has assisted in the computation process by identifying the most sensitive portions of the parameter space, based on the representative curves, and suggesting that calculations be performed for that subset of the entire space.  Selecting specific propagation paths in the area will result in a better representative TL set for that particular geographic region.  Consistency AnalysisOften in simulations, different participants employ different propagation models of varying degrees of complexity and fidelity. So as not to preclude the use of one model over another, there must be some way to establish that, at some phenomenological level, the models being used have “consistent” responses to the environmental conditions. Consistency analysis is the name given to the method devised to assure sufficiently consistent response of different propagation or other environmental effects models to satisfy the objectives of the simulation.The cluster analysis and MDEAs described above have proven useful in identifying the general response of a model to selected environmental conditions (i.e., those you expect to encounter within the simulation). Comparison of models at this level of abstraction is much easier than using detailed model responses to effect such an investigation. Ultimately, however, the degree of similarity and/or difference that can be tolerated is driven by the accuracy requirements of the simulation.As an example of the method, a particular environmental input (viz., the slope/rise/front ISNE) was selected and two different models – ASTRAL and the Parabolic Equation (PE) model – were exercised using those inputs.  A 20-cluster set of parameters (i.e., from the representative curves) was used for expediency, although any number can be accommodated by this technique.  Outputs from the ASTRAL model and the PE model for the 20 cases were visually similar, but were subjected to more quantitative comparison.  The differences between each corresponding pair of curves, on a point-by-point basis, were computed. The mean and standard deviations of those differences are presented in Figure 3.11.Figure 3.11 	Mean and Standard Deviation of Differences 	Between ASTRAL and PE  TL  results for a 	Given ISNE (20-cluster example)The differences between the two models, for 16 of the 20 cases, is less than 3 dB, and all 20 are less than 6 dB.  Using this comparison, one could say that the 2 models appear reasonably consistent over the parameters associated with the 20 clusters, perhaps more so with the first 16 clusters.  However, if the tolerance of the simulation were more stringent (say, less than 2 dB error/difference), then this same result would indicate that the 2 models are not consistent for that application. Given that the representative curves “stand in”  for all of the TL curves within a given cluster, the consistency (or lack thereof) can be expected to span the entire cluster mapping for each of the 20 cluster example.  This is a powerful technique, in that the consistency (or lack thereof) between 2 or more models can be established over a broad parameter interval without necessitating the execution of a large number of TL runs.The consistency analysis need not be applied solely for different models - it can also be employed to compare the response of a particular model with an alternative implementation of that model.  Some of those alternative implementations may have originated as a result of the “use strategy” investigations described in Section 3.2. Others may have been developed explicitly as substitutes for the original model(s) (e.g., simplified mathematical models, adaptive interpolators).Summary and Recommendations for Future  StudyWe have developed a methodology for identifying important sensitivities of environmental effects models to environmental inputs.  This methodology has been implemented in a Cluster Analysis Tool, intended for distribution to others requiring the means to develop techniques for implementing their models more efficiently in simulations with limited CPU resources.Further,  we have developed products supporting more efficient use of the ASTRAL acoustic propagation model in advanced computer simulations.  These products support more cost-effective real-time use of ASTRAL in simulations and trainers (Model Use-Strategy), .near-optimum selection of a minimum set of TL calculations required to represent ASTRAL TL for a given geographic region (MDEAs), and methods for evaluating the consistency between two or more propagation models to be implemented in a networked simulation (Consistency Analysis).The use-strategy recommendations and MDEAs could be further strengthened by applying the analysis techniques and methodologies to other geographic areas.  A region in the Northwest Atlantic was investigated as part of this current study,  providing a promising (albeit limited) extension to the current findings.With respect to the MDEAs, the regional delineation of the features in the area is still somewhat imprecise.  As a result, the details of the TL in the transition between propagation paths and/or mapping assignments might be lacking in detail (and in fact may be somewhat discretized).  By investigating the details of the environmental data along a specific track, based on some specific characterizations of the sound  velocity profile and the bathymetry (depth and  type), a more complete and general MDEA scheme might be developed.  Using  the environmental data to characterize the propagation along a particular path would be independent of model used.  Therefore, this “generalized environmental abstraction” (GEA)  might be more widely relevant throughout many geographic regions, and may very well provide a more precise description of the actual propagation as well.  The GEAs would also increase the efficacy of the consistency analysis techniques, in that not only consistency (or lack thereof) between models could be better established, but also accuracy and validity of the model outputs could be ascertained. These will indeed require further investigations.Finally, we have limited (by necessity) our study to that of acoustic propagation in the ocean.  However, our techniques and methodologies are equally relevant to other energy propagation models and domains as well.  Indeed, a very limited assessment of the relevance of our approach to atmospheric radar propagation phenomena has been quite promising.References:[1]	F. C. Newman, Mandelberg M. D., Biondo A.
