The SIAP federations included experimentation with United States Navy (USN) E-2C and United States Army (USA) Patriot to evaluate impact of biases with system geodetic and sensor registration, and time synchronization on reported track quality and correlation. The two USAF led federations addressed objectives to assess Critical Area Air Defense (CAAD) homeland defense architectures and improve Joint Cruise Missile Defense (JCMD) Battle Management Command and Control tactics, techniques, and procedures. For FY04, in addition to continuing support to SIAP SE, CAAD, and JCMD federations, additional federations have been proposed for Joint Theater Air and Missile Defense (JTAMD) mission area to include the USA objective for Patriot Block 0 Improvement, USN objectives for Integrated Fire Control and Defense of Japan/Korea, USAF objectives for Ground Moving Target Indicator, and Missile Defense Agency/United States Strategic Command (MDA/STRATCOM) objectives for Early Warning. Additionally, JDEP also is extending its focus and working directly with several new users to key acquisitions programs such as Joint Strike Fighter and Future Combat SystemsTable of Contents TOC \o \h \z  HYPERLINK \l "_Toc48920785" 1.

JDEP Overview	The Joint Distributed Engineering Plant (JDEP) is a funded initiative created to support systems engineering, integration, and testing of distributed systems.  The Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC), as the technical coordinator, is responsible for maintaining the technical framework, assisting users to identify and access existing mission computer hardware and software in the loop and simulation capabilities across the Department of Defense (DOD) and industry, and providing technical support to federate these into distributed system environments for use in development, integration, testing, and assessments.   These simulation and hardware/software (HW/SW) federations provide the environment to address the challenges of engineering complex distributed systems early in the life cycle, and to assess performance and interoperability in controlled environments long before deployment and to examine the impact of design and development options before making costly implementation decisions.a.  Technical FrameworkThe JDEP technical framework (Dahmann and Clarke 2002), depicted in Figure 1, provides a standards profile that facilitates repeatability, reusability, and integration of various components into a distributed environment.  The communications layer uses industry standard communications services for the physical exchange of data between the components. The information/data management layer is based on the IEEE High Level Architecture (HLA) Run Time Infrastructure (RTI) and services and acts as the distributed operation system responsible for the efficient and reliable delivery of data. .  The data exchange is defined by a Federation Object Model (FOM) to provide the conditions, syntax, and semantics of the data exchange.  Applications such as system representations (e.g., Patriot), enabling system representations (scenario, communications, environment), and commercial federation utilities (e.g., data collection and viewing) operate through an agile application interface to the RTI and are intended to be flexible to support reconfiguration for different federations.      Figure 1: Technical Frameworkb.  Systems Engineering Reference FOMTo promote interoperability across federations, JDEP has established a Systems Engineering Reference FOM (SETF) (Eiserman and Talbot 2003).  JDEP established the SERF to influence FOM development for applicable programs by providing a common starting point with a hierarchy of objects and interactions that, when adhered to, can be tailored to suit user needs (i.e., fidelity) and also enhance future interoperability.  The SERF offers multiple representations of the same objects so that the federation designer might choose between varieties of representations of differing fidelity.  JDEP assists users to tailor the SE RF for specific applications and has established a process to expand the SERF based on experience.c.  Coordination SupportJITC provides technical support to assist developers, testers, and warfighters create federations of systems to support systems integration and interoperability throughout the development and deployments process. JITC uses a combination of core and users funding to provide first order federation planning and follow-on technical support. For federation planning, JITC leverages the IEEE Federation Development and Execution Process (Figure 1), an open standards-based structured systems engineering approach, for assisting users create federations to meet their specific requirements. JITC assists users with expertise during the critical up front steps of the FEDEP to ensure the objectives are transformed into a set of very specific set of federation objectives and that the FOM is designed and developed and the agreements established to ensure the data exchanges support the federation.  Follow-on support is focused on assisting the users access required systems (Patriot hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL)) and common components (scenario drivers, tactical communications emulations, data collection devices).d.  Network DescriptionThe JDEP backbone network for the Joint Air and Missile Defense (JTAMD) Mission Area (MA) utilizes the Defense Information System Network - Leading Edge Services (DISN-LES), a commercial Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network, to provide protected communications channels in order to transport data on a secure network operated by the Advanced Information Technology Joint Program Office.  Node configurations include a black (unclassified) Government owned ATM switch and Cisco router at each site with commercial ATM service at DS-3 capacity and can grow as bandwidth needs increase.  Behind the black (unclassified) ATM switch is a KG-75 FASTLANE encryption device that secures a (classified) SECRET network.  A Red ATM switch provides secure ATM network services with connections to a Cisco router and an ATM to Ethernet switch with ports to connect assorted site equipment at 10/100BaseT. Optional equipment includes a voice over IP SphereCom telephone hub/phones for event coordination, an Applied Systems Technology Incorporated (ASTI) phone ring to support dedicated channels for replicated tactical voice communications, a Video Teleconference (VTC) system, various Global Positioning System (GPS) timing solutions, and a NetVCR device for monitoring network internet protocol level traffic. Unique site application level equipment configurations are interconnected over this secure network into federations using Local Area Network (LAN) devices and Virtual LANs (VLANs).  Figure 1 shows a typical DISN-LES node JDEP configuration to include required and optional communications equipment, and the application level JDEP and tactical equipment. Figure 2. Network Application Example2.  Coordination Support and Infrastructure ImprovementsDuring FY03, JDEP evolved its event coordination and operations support capabilities, initiated efforts to improve common capabilities, and extended the JTAMD network connections to multiple facilities.a.  Event Coordination and Federation Engineering SupportFor FY04, JDEP will leverage lead and support federation engineers using core funding to coordinate with users to determine requirements for JDEP federation engineering and JDEP Operations Center support, participate in event working group meetings, provide guidance on first steps of the FEDEP, and monitor and report on user federation design and development entrance/exit criteria and monitor event activities. Event coordination and federation engineering responsibilities beyond this, such as defining and delineating objectives, perform conceptual analysis, or designing the federation/FOM are supported on a user funded basis.b.  Operations Center SupportTo compliment the event coordination and federation engineering planning support, JDEP has evolved its Operations Center at JITC located at Ft Hauchuca, Arizona to provide support in federation monitoring and troubleshooting, network management, security accreditation, configuration management, and data management.  Federation Monitoring and TroubleshootingJDEP Operations Center assists user federation and federate integration and federation execution by providing expertise and assistance with RTIs, and monitoring/trouble shooting of application level end-to-end HLA data exchange in accordance with variants of the SERF and supporting agreements, as well as common tactical data link backbone and host exchanges. Network Management and MonitoringJDEP Operations Center the DISN-LES JPO work together to provide for out of band (OOB) management to access, configure, and monitor the ATM equipment without using the ATM network.  Capabilities include Remote Monitoring (RMON) Sniffer to for key statistics available for performance and fault management from a remote SNMP manager; NetVCR to provide ability to perform traffic analysis on layers 2 through 7 at data rates for LAN traffic for 10/100 to Gigabit and WAN traffic up to ATM OC-3;  Concord Network Health to support network optimization algorithms to facilitate the best network architecture; HP Open View to display what systems are up or down through a color scheme show detailed configuration, status and other properties of the network; and, FOREView to monitor the ATM specific equipment and to remotely administer these devices.  Security AccreditationJDEP Operation Center has worked with the Defense Security Service to develop a Network Security plan to address critical issues for connecting contractor facilities and government facilities for test events.  This plan identifies specific instructions concerning the interconnected networks within the JDEP community to include security profiles and requirements for all JDEP nodes for future test events.  Additionally, JDEP has written a Security Classification Guide to assist federation leads understand the classification level of data during and after an event. JDEP has also developed a Site Accreditation Guide to provide detailed instructions on what is needed and when to achieve security accreditation to connect to the JDEP network. The site accreditation guide is not only used by the services and organization but also by the Defense Security Service for connection requirements to the JDEP program. Configuration ManagementJDEP Operations Center, in coordination with the JDEP Service resource managers, has developed and applied a configuration management plan to support network, common component, and site-specific configuration management.  Appendices are provided for each unique federation that specifies procedures for Configuration Control Board approval prior to the event.  The federation specific appendices also include plan of action and schedule milestones to support status tracking throughout the planning process.Data Management SupportJDEP Operations Center FTP Server provides Anti -Virus software for PC, Disk Wiping software for PC with Windows NT, Disk Wiping software for PC with Windows 95, CFBL Directory/Telephone Book, and Sun Solaris 2.5.1 Disk Wiping Instructions to JDEP users.  The JDEP Data exchange Data Repository serves as a network data repository for test files history and archive, and an FTP server to transfer those network data files collected at each location to site and network analysts at alternate locations.c.  Subject Matter Expert SupportJDEP has also evolved subject matter expertise in many key commercial off-the-shelf and government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) solutions to include HLA gateways, tactical communications devices, and timing solutions, and data collection/instrumentation devices.  These services are provided on a JDEP mission funded basis in the way of help desk assistance, or on a reimbursable basis for on-site support, e.g., installation, integration, operation, etc.Modeling and Simulation Translation/GatewaysJDEP capabilities include expertise with commercial and DoD developed solutions for translating between different standards based modeling and simulation technologies to include Distributed Interactive Simulation, HLA, and the Test and Training Range Enabling Architecture (TENA). Tactical CommunicationsJDEP maintains expertise in the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) Gateway Terminal Emulator (GTE) and Northrup Grumman Common Connectivity Device (CCD) that provide Link 11 and/or Link 16 terminal emulations.  These devices emulate the tactical communications terminal equipment and through simulation of both electronic and protocol interfaces and functions of the tactical communications equipment.Timing Solutions/DevicesJDEP maintain knowledge on a cadre of timing solutions to include Global Positioning System (GPS) devices that provide satellite broadcast timing and navigation information, IRIG B equipment to interface to equipment that is not directly compatible with GPS, and Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers that provides an alternate to GPS for timing enabling client computers to maintain system time synchronization with the US Naval Observatory Master Clocks in Washington, DC and Colorado Springs, CO.Data Collection/InstrumentationJDEP provides expertise/components for data collection, data importing, data parsing, common database storage, data analysis, and 3D presentation and analysis of the modeling and simulation entity related data exchange as well as tactical communication data exchanged with hosts and on the backbone.  d.  Infrastructure Improvement BuildsAs part of the evolution of JDEP, new capabilities that better represent operational environments to provide analysis capability in support of the SIAP System Engineer and other eventual higher fidelity JTAMD users (Furness, Eiserman, Geyer, Ludwig, Seidel, Talbot 2003).  The inclusion of these capabilities are being introduced gradually through a series of “Infrastructure Builds” that provide increasing levels of fidelity with each subsequent release.  Using this approach, JDEP is prototyping, verifying and validating new JDEP capabilities before integrating to sites. Figure 3 depicts key components that comprise the initial infrastructure build.  These components include a Common Reference Scenario Driver (CRSD) to provide playback capability of air tracks in authoritative scenario, a 1st Order Navigation Federate to represent onboard navigation (accelerometer, ring-laser gyro, etc.) and generates feeds to the Mission Computer Program (MCP), a 1st Order Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Federate to represent onboard IFF and report perfect responses from other aircraft, a 1st Order Sensor Federate to represent onboard radar and generates radar inputs; a 1st Order Comm Federate to represent Link 16 and Terminal/Host interactions; a 1st Order MCP federate to act as a peer MCP that can generate remote tracks. The SIAP MCP Behavior Model is the SIAP-developed representation of mission computer program. The 1st Order Navigation, IFF, and Sensor federates all generate their feeds based on ground truth data received from CRSD. All of the interactions between federates go across the RTI and are being incorporated into SERF.   Figure 3.  JDEP Initial Infrastructure Build3.  FY03 JTAMD FederationsIn FY03, JDEP supported five federations for the Joint Air and Missile Defense mission area.  The federations supported objectives proposed by the Single Integrated Air Picture Systems Engineer, United States Navy, United States Air Force, and United States Strategic Command.  a.  SIAP SE Experimentation Federations The SIAP SE time synchronization and data registration federations are critical experiments that characterize the sensitivity of the E-2C and Patriot SIAP performance to time synchronization and data registration biases within the context of the SIAP SE common reference scenario.  For E-2C, the E-2C Systems Test and Evaluation Laboratory (ESTEL) used its HWIL capability to conduct this test with the Group II (C) variant, the Hawkeye 2000 as the system under test.  These tests were conducted in the ESTEL facilities located at Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWC-AD), Naval Air Station (NAS) Patuxent River, MD, from 4 through 15 November 2002.  For Patriot, the Systems Engineering Directorate is using its HWIL capability to conduct this test with the PDB5+ variant of the PATRIOT as the system under test.  These tests are will be conducted at Software Engineering Directorate (SED), Redstone Arsenal, AL and are tentatively scheduled for weeks 8 and 28 September 2002. SIAP SE is using the results of these tests support SIAP block upgrade and new system development assessments. Both federations’ activities included an implementation and verification of biasing upgrades.b.  USAF Critical Area Air Defense FederationThe CAAD Phase II event will integrate, test, evaluate, verify, and validate emerging Homeland Defense (HLD) architectures and Concepts of Operations (CONOPS) for a variety of critical assets and geographical locations.  It will include simulated complex low observable threats, simulated air defense (combined fighters and missiles), and inclusion of C2 Operators from Tyndall AFB in the simulation loop.  Systems and facilities that support this event include:  Electronic Systems Center (ESC) Air Operations Center at Command and Control Enterprise Integration Facility (CEIF) at Hanscom Air Force Base, MA; Air Battle Management at 1st AF North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) Software Support Facility (NSSF); Raytheon War-Gaming Laboratory in Tucson, AZ; E-3C Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) at Boeing facility in Seattle, WA; United States Marine Corps (USMC) Tactical Air Operations Center (TAOC) at Camp Pendelton, CA; ESTEL at Patuxent River, MD;  and the Raytheon Bedford, MA facility for the Elevated AN/TPS-63 and Ground based and Elevated MPQ-64 [Sentinel].c.  USAF Joint Cruise Missile Defense FederationThe Joint Cruise Missile Defense (JCMD) System Test 2 (ST-2) is part of the Secretary of Defense’s continuing JCMD Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&E) program, examining methods to improve the operational effectiveness of joint cruise missile defenses that are a component of the Pentagon’s broader integrated air-defense structure.  This simulation will include Operators in the Loop (OITL) and will feature systems that detect, track, identification, allocate and engage hostile targets including cruise missiles.  From the result of these engagements, the Joint Integrated Air Defense System concept and doctrine can be assessed and improved to optimize expected human and system performance required to meet the threat.  The systems/facilities supporting the JCMD event include the ESC CEIF; Theater Aerospace C2 Simulation Facility (TACCSF) OITL simulators for Air Force CRC, AWACS, and F15; the Joint National Integration Center (JNIC) provide JCMD scenarios TBM threats using MDWAR simulator; E-3C AWACS at the Boeing facility in Seattle, WA; Boeing Virtual Warfare Center in St Louis; the ESTEL at Patuxent River, MD; and the Aegis HWIL at Dahlgren, VA. 4.  FY04 Proposed JTAMD FederationsIn addition to continued support to proposed follow-on USAF CAAD and JCMD federations, incorporation of digital representations and HWILs for SIAP experimentation, JTAMD proposed events for FY04 include federations supporting USA Patriot Block 0 improvements, USN Integrated Fire Control, USN Defense of Korea/Japan Interoperability, and MDA/STRATCOM Early Warning Assessments. a.  USA Patriot Block 0 FederationThe Army event, Block 0 Upgrade, will assess the SIAP Block 0 Upgrades to the PATRIOT PDB-6 Software to include: Correlation/Decorrelation (Mil Std 6016B); Formation Tracking and Assessment (only a rudimentary implementation available); and Data Registration Critical Experiment (A Radar calibration effort to improve data registration and track accuracy by determining and correcting sensor registration biases using a Sensor Registration Algorithm provided by the SIAP SE TF.)  Participants in the event include the Patriot, E2C, and Aegis.  Additional sites which may be used if available include the TAOC, F/A-18, and AWACS.b.  USN Integrated Fire Control FederationNavy Integrated Fire Control event objective is two fold.  First to assess AEGIS baseline 6 phase 3 in a Joint environment as a contributor to Integrated Fire Control (IFC).  This will include an assessment of the overall impacts of multiple Sensor and Data Fusion Devices and the AEGIS 6ph3 is the baseline computer program which will integrate Cooperative Engagement Capability  (CEC) into the fleet of 57 AEGIS destroyers.  The second high level objective it to support development of the SIAP to include the AEGIS DDG fleet significant contributors to SIAP and the Joint interoperability of CEC/Link 16.  Joint participants in the event are projected to include: E-2C, F-18, AWACS, F-15, CAOC, TPS-59, Patriot, and JLENS along with the Navy Integrated Warfare Systems (PEO IWS1B).c.  USN Defense of Japan/Korea FederationNavy Defense of Japan and Korea event objective is to assess architecture for an operationally relevant theater of operations supporting a Combatant Commander requirement to ensure a single integrated air picture while focusing on the joint arena.  The event may include a coalition excursion.  Systems required for the event include 4 Carrier Battle Groups plus multiple Joint players: Patriot, AWACS, CAOC, TPS-59, and TAOC.  The event will leverage an operationally relevant scenario using 2004 deployed forces and will maximize useful products for the warfighter (capabilities and limitations, workarounds, tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), architecture assessment  etc.)d.  MDA/STRATCOM Early Warning FederationsThe MDA/STRATCOM Radar Experiment Event will investigate radar data platforms (Cobra Judy, Aegis, TPS-XX radars, Patriot/PAC-3, and other in-theater platforms) to determine interoperability/integration issues with the current missile warning architecture family of systems.  Provide USSTRATCOM and MDA insight into these programs to establish integration baselines. The display and correlation of infrared and radar missile warning data as well as current and future tactical data processors (TDPs) will require integration testing to ensure interoperability is achieved and/or maintained. The MDA/STRATCOM Continue Theater Airborne Warning System (TAWS) event will examine integration with the current missile warning architecture family of systems.  Initial analysis indicates that TAWS data (in its current format) is not compatible with current theater warning TDPs (i.e. GCCS, WOTS, PDS-M). A more detailed evaluation is needed to understand the issues surrounding TAWS integration with current systems. Systems participating include Existing JDEP Early Warning Node (Schriever AFB, CO); TAWS Platform; Early Warning Architecture; Tactical Data Processors (GCCS, PDS-M, SEW-D); and Tactical Receivers (TRS, MATT, CTT-HR)The MDA/STRATCOM IPP event will investigate integration improvement concepts within the Early Warning system of systems to implement an interoperable and consistent Impact Point Prediction estimation and display methodology for threat determination and containment for active and passive defense warning and cueing.  Make recommendations for engineering changes to the EW change control/configuration control process run by USSTRATCOM and MDA. Systems to be tested include Existing JDEP Early Warning Node (Schriever AFB, CO); Early Warning Architecture; Tactical Data Processors (GCCS, PDS-M, SEW-D, MARS, EWS); Tactical Receivers (TRS, MATT, CTT-HR, JTRS); and Early Warning Producers (SBIRS, JTAGS/M3P, TACDAR)5.  Acquisition Program Supporta.  Technical ApproachIn order to facilitate future interoperability between major DOD systems in distributed testing venues, JDEP has established an outreach effort to major acquisition programs.  The focus of this effort is to identify common framework requirements, facilitate common implementation of solutions, and to assist the acquisition community in positioning itself for testing in a distributed and joint environment.  JDEP is focused on identifying formalized model development which can facilitate verification and validation ("goodness") of the models for use in the joint environment, as well as ensuring the acquisition programs define information and data management, data exchange, and application interface services.  The networking solution tends to be the most emphasized area in system development as DOD has tremendous experience in resolving communications and connectivity issues.  However, without the emphasis on the other M&S components, the ability of simulations to work in a joint, distributed environment can be severely impeded.  JDEP places a strong emphasis on addressing these other framework components.b.  Programs SupportedTo these ends, JDEP has established relationships and is working closely with the Future Combat System (FCS) and Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Program Officers.  JDEP is also focusing on and has, or will in the near term, initiated coordination with Program Offices for Joint Integration and Interoperability of Special Operations (JIIS0) Joint Test and Evaluation (JTE), CVN 21 (future aircraft carrier), Distributed Common Ground/Surface Systems (DCGS), Multi-Sensor Command and Control Aircraft System (MC2A), Open Architecture (OA), Common Aviation Command and Control System (CAC2S), and DD(X) Future Surface Combatant Program.  The use of common framework among these acquisition programs can benefit DOD to a great extent in the individual system developments and in establishment of capabilities available to the DOD community.6.  JDEP Network Expansion for JTAMD Mission AreaThe JDEP Network Engineering Group performed site surveys, defined and acquired site/platform unique tools that enabled new sites to successfully network with JDEP sites.  The JDEP Network group installed JDEP nodes at the Boeing Virtual Warfare Center (VWC), St. Louis, MO; the Joint National Integration Center (JNIC), Schriever AFB, Colorado; the Marine Corps Tactical Systems Support Activity (MCTSSA), Camp Pendleton, CA; the Theater Aerospace C2 Simulation Facility (TACCSF), Kirtland AFB, NM; the Boeing Avionics Integration Laboratory (AIL) Seattle, WA; the Raytheon labs (Tucson, AZ and Bedford, MA); the E2C Laboratory, Patuxent River, MD; the Northrup Grumman Cyber Warfare Integration Network Center, El Segundo, CA; the 1st Air Force, Tyndall, AFB, FL; the PATRIOT facility, Huntsville, AL; and the Electronic Systems Center (ESC), Hanscom AFB, MA.  Additional site surveys have been conducted at Lockheed Martin Global Vision Network (GVNet) at Arlington, VA; and the Lockheed Martin facility AEGIS facility at Moorestown, NJ.  Figure 4 identifies the DISN-LES nodes as well as the Service and Industry facilities/systems that have or are participating in JDEP federations.Figure 4.
