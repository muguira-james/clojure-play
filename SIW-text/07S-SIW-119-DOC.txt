Name of Forum or Group:  SAPDChairCrash KonwinVice ChairJames CoolahanSecretaryTim JahrenObjectives for this Workshop:Comments and Recommendations:Interesting Assertion:  One paper said that neither DIS nor HLA (nor TENA?) are "Net Ready' due to the lack of a security layer. I don't know if that is true in general or in specific but believe someone should follow-up on the comment.EURO SIW:  To the best of my knowledge, none of the elected members of the SAPD PRP will be attending EURO SIW and therefore we will need Conference Committee to nominate someone to Chair the session.  Two potential people to approach:  Randy Saunders (APL) or Jonathan Reed (QiNetiC) if you wish to approach them. Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)40Peak attendance (including joint sessions)20Total papers presented8“No-show” presentations1Other presentations and panel discussions1Recommended Reading List nomination: Highlight: PRA paper nominated and deserving of SIWzie - 074Discussion:  With multiple forums and multiple offerings, maybe this is time to consider telescoping the SAPD and RD&E and VWS and T&E (or some subset) into a lesser number of robust forums.                 2007 SPRING SIW OUTBRIEF FORM
