Name of Forum or Group:   Test & Evaluation Forum   (T&E)ChairGeoff SauerbornVice ChairArman  TchoubinehSecretarySharon HardyObjectives for this Workshop:To present distributed testing M&S technologies and exercises and studies supporting T&E.Encourage participation within the T&E forum community for interest in volunteering ideas for T&E related study groups.Comments and Recommendations:Study Group for universal identifiers?:  There was interest in exploring a study group to look into vehicle/entity identifiers.  Many simulations, domains, and countries use different descriptors.  Can SISO produce a recommended standard set of identifiers or method of representing them.  These would translate to real-world systems and be uniform among simulations.  A small group discussed this option off line.  One individual said they would post a summary and further discussion on the T&E discussion reflector. Results from one paper (0S6-SIW-104) drew some controversy.  In general it has been the PRP policy to recommend publishing reasonable papers and if there is any question, to allow authors the opportunity to defend their findings during the workshop.  The SISO Policy and Procedures need to be reviewed for guidance on “pulling” papers by any one other than the authors.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)23Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)39Peak attendance (including joint sessions)72Total papers presented   17“No-show” presentations 2Other presentations and panel discussions0Recommended Reading List nominations (including previous nominations):SIW-06S-0742006 SPRING SIW OUTBRIEF FORM
