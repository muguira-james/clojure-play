Name of Forum or Group:  RD&EChairJohn FayVice ChairCharles CohenSecretaryRalph WeberObjectives for this Workshop:To deliver a broad range of informative papers to the SISO community.  These papers cover not only RD&E concepts, but also new and innovative ideas that have no home in the other forums.Comments and Recommendations:Comments: We would like to encourage authors to give talks that are actually based on their abstracts and papers, and not change things at the last minute.  That is, changes should really be approved before the conference, discussed with the forum chairs beforehand.   so that the presentation matches the focus of the session and conference.  This happened with one of our papers (09S-SIW-021), and this paper also significantly exceeded the paper length (which we approved), but we didn’t expect the presentation to be different. A subset of key points would have been a valid presentation.  With respect to paper 09S-SIW-031, there was interest in a study group being formed to investigate Common Object Model Components.  The question was whether this should occur before the author’s work is complete or after (the author wanted after, the community wanted before).Recommendations: 23Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)31Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)56Peak attendance (including joint sessions)56Total papers presented11“No-show” presentations1Other presentations and panel discussionsn/aRecommended Reading List nomination: 09S-SIW-031.               2009 SPRING - OUTBRIEF
