As M&S evolves, higher resolutions and fidelity levels can be achieved to allow full immersion in a training environment.  However, it was found in developing a suitable medical trainer (07F-SIW-037) that a lower fidelity, more compact and rugged trainer was needed to accomplish desired training objectives.  The basic medic need only administer first aid to victims on the field until they can be properly attended by licensed doctors.  The Combat Trauma Patient Simulation that was developed, although a useful tool, was not appropriate for the intended audience.  As standards and training are developed, it’s important to keep in mind the end user requirements instead of designing something with all the bells and whistles.  On the other hand, when trying to reach a desired fidelity, technology can sometimes be a constraint.  A careful balance must be achieved between what the user needs and what can be achieved with technology, as was demonstrated when building a highly scalable urban and regional populace model (07F-SIW-040).  In this application, a compromise was found by creating a mixed resolution simulation.  The hardware needed did not have the power to create a dynamic high fidelity populace and some of the fidelity was reduced in less visible areas with no impact to the user.  A third paper demonstrated that there are times when a higher fidelity is needed than what can be found out in the field in order to show students the impact of their actions (07F-SIW-072).  In developing a Standardized Space Trainer, instructors requested a screen that would display a satellite’s responses to commands issued by the students during training.  Operationally, this would not occur but instructors needed to get across the impact of the student’s actions during training.  As technology continues to fuel development, it is the users that must drive the direction of training development.2.  Game-Based Training Systems:  The TRAIN forum has continued to express its interest in the emerging commercial gaming market as it relates to the more traditional modeling and simulation market for training.  At this SIW event, three papers were presented that discussed a specific thread of successful commercial gaming technology – that of Artificial Intelligence (AI).  Cory Kumm, from Presagis, was invited to present his views on next-generation game artificial intelligence and the impact on training and simulation applications (07F-SIW-TRAIN_Invited).  The future of game AI is forcing an increase within traditional simulation and serious games environments to address interoperability shortfalls (game engines, middleware, and next generation simulation systems), scalability (larger and larger urban environments), and fidelity (denser and denser urban environments).  Paper 07-SIW-001 discussed how military operations are becoming increasingly urban and civilian oriented.  Simulations are no longer limited to regular forces (exhibiting precise, stereotypical or “doctrinal” behaviors) but also to civilian and atypical fighters (showing chaotic, irrational and even random behaviors).  These simulations must embrace and embed new game-based technology.  Paper 07-SIW-063 examined the similarities and differences between a military tank company commander and a clan leader in the Battlefield 2 commercial game.  The author suggests that important methods and technology (visualization and human machine interface) could be reused from this game within current and future command and control decision support tools and simulations.3.  Tasks/Standardization.  Four papers discussed areas related to either training tasks or standardization.      a)  Paper 07F-SIW-065, described how training for Emergency Management (EM) personnel is a focus because most Emergency Operations Center (EOC) participants are only part time, coming together only when EOCs are stood up.  Training exercises are difficult and expensive because they require pulling together a lot of personnel from different agencies/fields.  The Mission Essential Competency (MEC) development process starts with Workshop 1 in which there is a mission review, tasks are identified, and the initial generation of supporting competencies and knowledge and skills are generated.  Before Workshop 2, the data is consolidated and put into the MEC format.  Workshop 2 consists of a supporting competency and knowledge and skill review/refinement and minimum standards are identified.  Future focuses include formalizing EOC structure, develop training objectives, compile simulator training event requirements, and developing methods to evaluate training effectiveness.      b)  Paper 07F-SIW-81 described an effort to use data interchange definitions as a basis for model-level standards.  Three types of interactions to/from models were discussed, those to another model in the same simulation, those to a model in a different simulation, and interactions with the environment.  The effort hopes that appropriate definitions will lead to increased interoperability, reusability, and validity.      c)  Paper 07F-SIW-099 noted how standards must keep up with emerging technologies and weapons that will play a role in future training simulations.  There’s a need to develop a new format to present standards that is less cumbersome and more immersive that can be easily updated and changed but does not completely eliminate all the continuity and history of how the standard evolved.  Currently by the time standards are validated, they are obsolete.      d)  Paper 07F-SIW-111 discussed distributed interservice/country training in a Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) environment.  Complimentary training requirements are identified prior to an exercise so no one is just a training aid.  Virtual Local Area Networks include: truth data, tactical data link, voice, brief/debrief, and exercise control.  Multiple Wide Area Networks employed: Joint Training and Experimentation Network (JTEN), Defense Research and Experimentation Network (DREN), (DMON), (ARCNet), (MDA Net).  Seamless transition of live and virtual platforms can occur without negatively impacting the training scenario.4.  The TRAIN Forum continues to receive numerous papers that address our Call for Papers topics.  We’re currently investigating resurrecting our panel presentation format for future SIW events.  Based upon forum audience attendance figures, a topic of community interest addresses games-based training systems.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)36Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)64Peak attendance (joint sessions)N/ATotal papers presented9“No-show” presentations3Other presentations and panel discussions1Recommended Reading List nomination: 07F-SIW-066:  Applying the Mission Essential Competency Development Process to an Emergency Operations Center07F-SIW-081:  Joint Interaction Validation                 2007 FALL SIW OUTBRIEF FORM
