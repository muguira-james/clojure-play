The establishment of the Army’s Medical Simulation and Training Centers and the creation of simulation centers at major Army Hospitals are further evidence of how this technology has been embraced.  The US Army Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC) has been a major catalyst in the growth and acceptance of simulation for medical applications.  On April 1-2, 2008 TATRC hosted a meeting of key government medical simulation stakeholders to assess the status of medical simulation policy and plans, identify shortfalls in medical  simulation and training capability, list recommendations for future research, and where appropriate – identify the  need for standards.  This paper will present a summary of the discussions during the two day meeting and the participants’ recommendations on the way ahead for medical simulation and training.  1. Introduction.  The objective of this paper is to provide an update to the mainstream simulation community on the “Breakthroughs” medical simulation and training technology has made over the past decade while acknowledging the remaining “Barriers” that inhibit the technology from achieving its full potential. It is intentionally a high level overview written by a program manager and intended for other program managers or commercial simulation providers who are not familiar with this domain.  Medical simulation and training covers the full spectrum of health care including devices for initial training of combat medics and first responders, devices for training surgical procedures, virtual reality systems for diagnosis and therapy, and team training systems for crisis or incident management.  In February 2000, the U.S. Army’s Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC) and the U.S. Army’s Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation Command (STRICOM) co-hosted a conference at the Morningside Inn -- a remote facility nestled among the rolling hills of northern Maryland.  The Morningside conference was designed to enable end users, researchers, materiel developers, and other government agencies to present their concepts on how modeling and simulation could and should be developed to meet military medical needs.  From the outset the participants recognized that Medical Modeling and Simulation (MM&S) would have a much wider application than originally envisioned.  The growth in the use of simulation by the Healthcare community over the past eight years has validated that assumption.2. Categories of Medical Simulation Systems.  The Morningside attendees identified four major categories of medical simulation devices: PC-Based Interactive Systems, Digitally Enhanced Mannequins, Virtual Workbenches (part task trainers), and Total Immersion Virtual Reality.  2.1 PC-Based Interactive Systems. In 2000 there were already many of these systems on the market being used to either augment classroom instruction or as a tool for learning and rehearsing clinical care processes. The advantages of this technology are universal availability and relatively low cost.  The major limitation at the time was a lack of quality assurance, particularly in the verification of clinical curriculum.  Figure 1 is an example of a PC-Based Simulation System.                 SHAPE  \* MERGEFORMAT Figure 1.

These full body patient simulators provide an interactive virtual platform for training a variety of skills and have been in use for many years. They are composed of sophisticated materials, have detailed anatomy, and are driven by PC-based systems that enable them to exhibit the signs and symptoms of injuries and react to clinical interventions.  These systems are relatively expensive, have a high degree of complexity and require system support arrangements.  Figure 2. is an example of a Mannequin based simulator. Figure 2.

Also known as “Part Task Trainers”, these can be relatively simple, inexpensive, but highly effective devices that enable the teaching and practice of an array of clinical and diagnostic procedures such as catheterization and bronchoscopy.  They can also be very complicated and expensive simulators which provide tactile feedback during teaching of minimally invasive procedures such as laparoscopic surgery.  Figure 3 is an example of a Virtual Workbench training system.  SHAPE  \* MERGEFORMAT  HYPERLINK  \l "_Hlk195418042" \s "1,5139,5167,0,, SHAPE  \\* MERGEFORMAT " Figure 3.

When the first Morningside meeting was held, there were no systems that could claim the capability to completely immerse individuals or teams in a virtual environment.  A low end immersive reality system might be a PC based system that uses 3-D goggles or helmet mounted visual display, stereo ear phones, and a track ball, joy stick or mouse to move about in the virtual world.  This approach is affordable, highly portable, can be hosted on a wide variety of platforms, and is easily modified for different scenarios and applications. An example of a high end TIVR system is a 30 foot dome with a 300 degree horizontal by 60 degree (or greater) vertical field of view with theater quality surround sound system, appropriate smoke and odors of the battlefield, and the ability to control the ambient temperature to match the simulated environment. Mobility could be achieved by an omni-directional treadmill or some other artificial method of locomotion. All these features enhance the immersive experience but at a considerably higher cost. It is also technically complex, requires a larger training area, lacks mobility, requires more costly support contracts, and has limited student throughput.  The best examples of a high end TIVR system from the year 2000 would be a high fidelity flight simulator consisting of a large dome with a six degree of freedom motion platform.  The bulk of the Army’s research in TIVR was and still is being led by the Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT), a government sponsored University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) at the University of Southern California.  Their vision is to create the 20th century version of the Star Trek Holodeck for warfighter training.  In 2000 there were no ICT projects targeted at training health care providers.  3. Breakthroughs in Medical Simulation.  Prior to the first Morningside meeting there was considerable discussion within the Healthcare Community about a 1999 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, “To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System,” which declared that, “at least 44,000 deaths and perhaps as many as 98,000 Americans die in hospitals each year from medical errors.  Even when using the lower estimate, deaths in hospitals due to preventable adverse events exceed the number attributable to the 8th leading cause of death.  Deaths due to preventable adverse events exceed deaths attributable to motor vehicle accidents breast cancer, or AIDs [1]. Recommendation 8.1 of the IOM report stated, Patient safety programs should… establish interdisciplinary team training programs for providers that incorporate proven methods of team training such as simulation [2].  A more recent report was published in “HealthGrades”, in 2008, which claimed that Patient safey incidents cost the federal Medicare program $8.8 billion and resulted in 238,337 potentially preventable deaths during 2004 through 2006, according to HealthGrades fifth annual Patient Safety in American Hospitals Study [3]. A significant percentage of these errors could probably be attributed to inexperience or lack of training opportunities. The Halstedian apprenticeship model “see one”, “do one”, “teach one” has been the norm for centuries and has serious limitations.  Since our tendency is to measure the proficiency of a doctor by how many times he or she has performed a procedure we want them to have as much experience as possible prior to operating on real patients.  It became obvious that all sectors of the medical community, and the general public whom they serve, would benefit if simulation could provide “Virtual Patients” for Healthcare professionals to practice on. The IOM and the Health Grades reports provided the impetus for the Healthcare community to embrace simulation technology. The following sections provide a snap shot of the changes that have taken place over the past eight years in each of the major categories identified at the first Morningside meeting.               3.1 Progress with PC-Based Interactive Systems.  As expected, this category has seen a rapid growth in the number of users and types of applications due to its low cost and universal availability. Figure 4 is a screen shot of a prototype system for conducting patient interviews.  Prerecorded video clips are played in response to the interviewers questions.  This approach is being considered as a means of reducing the number of standardized patients/actors required for teaching this skill.     SHAPE  \* MERGEFORMAT Figure 4.

It can also be used for sustainment training following troop deployment.  Figure 5 contains multiple screen shots of a Combat Medic Game-based system under development by the Virtual Reality Medical Center.      SHAPE  \* MERGEFORMAT Figure 5.

(Courtesy of the Virtual Reality Medical Center) A third variation being investigated is the use of On-Line Multiplayer games as learning environments for team training. They have the capability to connect team members who may be geographically separated to a training event.  The system shown in Figure 6 is being developed by Forterra, Inc. (with Stanford University) for a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear Event (CBRNE) training application.     SHAPE  \* MERGEFORMAT Figure 6.  Avatars participating in a Multiplayer On-Line CBRNE Exercise. (Forterra, Inc. with Stanford University).  3.2 Progress with Digitally Enhanced Mannequins. The major advances in mannequin technology have been the trends toward tetherless systems, improved physiology models, wireless communication, more realistic anatomy, and improvements in the educational content. The Human Patient Simulator, developed under a partnership between the U.S. Army and Medical Education Technologies, Inc. is shown in Figure 7.   SHAPE  \* MERGEFORMAT Figure 7.

This area has also grown exponentially in the past eight years.  The “Limbs and Things” Product Guide for 2007 shows over 60 training products in the areas of Obstetrics, Gynecology, Basic Surgery Skills, Joint Injections, Minor Surgery, Urology, Ultrasound, Vascular, and Anatomy.  MRMC/TATRC has sponsored research and delivered prototype simulators for treatment of Fractured Femurs, Compartment Syndrome, Exsanguinating Hemmorrhage, Cricothyroidotomies and many others including the VIRGIL simulator shown in Figure 8.   This system combines the use of a realistic mannequin with a PC-based graphical interface that tracks the position of chest darts and chest tubes during training exercises.       SHAPE  \* MERGEFORMAT Figure 8.  VIRGIL Simulator for Training Chest Tube Insertion.  (Center for Integration of Medicine and Innovative Technology (CIMIT)3.4 Status of Total Immersion Virtual Reality.  For the reasons discuss in paragraph 2.4 earlier, progress in this area is not as substantial as in the other three categories.  We have yet to achieve a true Holodeck like environment for medical applications. Figure 9 is a TIVR system recently implemented at the Intrepid National Armed Forces Rehabilitation Center, Brook Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio, Texas. It provides an immersive environment for treating traumatic amputee patients and burn patients requiring advanced rehabilitation therapy.          SHAPE  \* MERGEFORMAT Figure 9.  The CAREN System – A 21 Foot Dome with a 300 degree Horizontal Field of View, 20 degree Vertical and motion platform that responds to the patient’s movements. More progress has been achieved with the lower end PC-based systems. These at least partially submerge individuals in virtual reality.  They are being investigated for a myriad of applications including pain management for burn victims, and physical therapy for patients with spinal cord injuries, physical therapy for stroke patients, and Soldiers with Post Traumatic Syndrome Disorder (PTSD).  4.0 Factors Contributing to Breakthroughs in User Acceptance of Simulation.  As discussed in section 3, there were several key reports published around the start of this millennium that prodded the Healthcare Industry to seek ways to improve patient safety.  At the second Morningside meeting Dr. Kerm Henriksen, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), offered that today’s environment is one focused on “reducing harm to patients” and that there is also an “aggressive malpractice environment.”  This second factor cannot be ignored and any tool that may reduce the number of malpractice claims is worth pursuing.   The Telemedicine and e-Health News Alert recently reported that, physicians groups and health insurers are developing a set of national standards that can be used to rate physician performance [4]. The project known as the “Patient Charter for Physician Performance Measurement, Reporting and Tiering Programs,” will use separate cost effectiveness and quality of care measurements to rate physicians. Health insurers will also allow independent groups to review physician ratings. The Patient Charter will be overseen by the Consumer-Purchaser Disclosure Project, which is being funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation [5]  An Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) Bulletin released in December 2005 listed some reasons why medical educators should routinely use simulation: clinical skills should be learned as far away from the patient as possible; Health Care is one of the few high risk industries that does not conduct routine rehearsals and debriefings; Familiarity with protocols becomes clear during simulation; simulation can determine how residents respond in different contexts;  offer a controlled way to learn systems-based practice; and allow for practice of technical procedures in a safe environment [6].5. Department of Defense Medical Simulation Programs. Information in the following sections was obtained from briefings provided at the April 2008 Morningside meeting.   5.1 Army Medical Simulation Programs.   LTC(P) Robert Rush, MD., Anderson Simulation Center, Madigan Army Medical Center reported that in 2007 the Army Surgeon General established the Center for Simulation Committee (CSC).  The goal of the CSC was to create and implement a standardized Graduate Medical Education (GME) curriculum for resident education, to develop a program to assist in the Re-Deployment of physicians, and to improve patient safety.  The CSC was allocated a sum of $2.88M which allowed them to purchase enough simulators to train 9 specialties at 10 of the Army’s Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs). The CSC leadership is assisting both the Navy and Air Force regarding their CSC concepts and is willing to share curriculum with them.  The CSC has offered to set up links for online grading tools currently used by the Army.  5.1.1 Combat Medic Initial Training.  COL Patricia Hastings, Directorate of Combat Medic Sustainment Training, Ft. Sam Houston Texas, provided the following update on DCMT programs. Each year approximately 8000 Soldiers receive initial training at the Army’s Combat Medic Center and School.  The school teaches approximately 42 core skill requirements in their curriculum.  Digitized   mannequins are the essential element of the training portfolio but there is a stated need for more part task trainers, immersive environments, and PC game based systems. Addition of more ruggedized mannequins with recording capability, are also being considered.            5.1.2 Combat Medic Sustainment Training.  Mr. Harrol Ingram, Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation reported that in 2005, the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army directed that Medical Simulation Training Centers (MSTCs) be established at 18 Active Army installations. The MSTCs conduct Medical Skills sustainment training for Combat Medics and other non medical personnel called Combat Life Savers (CLS). Digitized mannequins are the core component of the MSTCs.  5.1.3. Army Reserve and National Guard (ARNG) Medic Training.  Not to be outdone, the Army Reserve and National Guard (ARNG) established a Medical Battalion Training Site at Ft. Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania.  The goals of this facility are to conduct sustainment training for 68Ws (Combat Medics) and to train the fundamentals of Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TC3) to potential Combat Life Savers. The site includes over 50 human patient simulation devices and related equipment.  MAJ Guy LeVeille and his staff train an average of 4000 Soldiers each year. 5.2 Air Force Medical Simulation Programs.  This program is managed by COL Deborah Burgess, MD, FACP, Chief Medical Operations Division, Headquarters, Air Education Command.  The mission is to “create a validated Distributed Human Patient Modeling and Simulation Program to integrate simulation technology to train and sustain medical skills for in garrison care, battlefield trauma, Critical Care Air Transport, Humanitarian Missions, CBRN and Natural Disasters……TO SAVE LIVES.”  A pilot simulation center was started in July 2006 using borrowed mannequins and medical equipment and other supplies from excess materials sources. A simulation working group sets goals, priorities and initial programs.  A conservative estimate of simulation equipment currently in the Air Force inventory is approximately 160 devices – mostly mannequins. Air Force Medical Modeling sites can be found at Travis Air Force Base, California; Willford Hall Medical Center, San Antonio Texas, Keesler AFB, Mississippi; Hurleburt Field, Florida; and Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.    The Air Force also established the Center for Sustainment of Trauma and Readiness Skills (C-STARS).  The goal of C-STARS is to prepare medics for today’s Air Force Medical Service. C-STARS is a sustainment training platform that is integrated into major civilian trauma centers throughout the continental United States.      5.3 Navy Medical Modeling and Simulation. CDR Russ Shilling, Naval Research Laboratory, is investigating the use of Virtual Reality for PTSD Therapy, Agent-based modeling tools for pandemic flu, video game therapy techniques for amputees, modeling of blast-related closed head injury and, with Texas A&M University, is creating a virtual representation of the patient treatment center at Bethesda Trauma Center Naval for training of a healthcare facility to provide accredited training.      6. Barriers and Remaining Challenges.  Despite all of the positive advances in medical simulation technology and the general acceptance within the user community challenges remain.  6.1 Policy and Requirements.  DoD as yet has not published a formal policy on Medical Simulation and Training but according to Dr. Gil Muniz, Director of Administration for the National Capital Area Medical Simulation Center (SimCen) the policy is being developed by a joint working group and should be released sometime later this year.  This is important to DoD users of medical simulation because policy drives programs, programs drive requirements, and requirements form the basis for authorizing funds for research, advanced development and sustainment of simulation devices.    Public health care providers are not impeded by requirements and the reports cited earlier provided sufficient justification of the need for and benefits of simulation as a means to improve the quality of care while as the same time reducing overall cost.    6.2 Shortfalls in Training Capability.  Several key issues kept surfacing at the Morningside meeting regarding training capability.    6.2.1 Curriculum. One key issue is that all this simulation activity must be driven by curriculum, and that tasks to be trained are agreed up front.  6.2.2 Team Training.  There is a need for additional systems focused on team training.  This applies to surgical teams in a hospital as well as combat medics and combat life savers.6.2.3 Live Training. All the breakthroughs discussed so far are in the use of “Virtual” environments.  An area that has been ignored is “Live” training. There is general agreement that combat medic training should be more fully integrated with live training exercises. A system is needed that would develop combat teams better suited to the current operating environment in which they are called upon to assess the situation, insure the perimeter is secure, extract casualties from vehicles, perform triage and evacuate the wounded to the next level of care.   6.3 Recommendations for Future Research. Improvements in haptic technology still remain one of the top areas for research despite the ongoing debate over how much the sense of touch contributes to the proficiency of a surgeon.  Also mentioned were better models of tissue-tool interactions, improvements in graphics and visualization tools; validation of models, and improvements in learning systems.The use of augmented reality systems that could superimpose real images of external or internal trauma injuries onto either a mannequin or individual acting as a patient are needed.   The grand challenge for simulation is to develop the capability to translate digitized full body scans of individuals into a 3 dimensional, interactive, virtual image that can be used for rehearsal of an impending operation.6.4 Standards and Architecture. The simulation standards identified at the Morningside meeting relevant to the medical training community were Shareable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM), Simulation High Level Architecture (HLA), Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM), and Health Level 7 (HL7).  It is assumed the readers of this paper are familiar with both SCORM and HLA. DICOM began in the 1970s when digital medical image sources were first introduced and a need existed to transmit these images and their associated information. The DICOM standard now specifies a network protocol utilizing TCP/IP, defines the Operations of Service Classes beyond the simple transfer of data, and creates a mechanism for uniquely identifying Information Objects as they are acted upon across a network.  DICOM defines Information Objects not only for images but also for patients, studies, reports, and other data grouping. The goals of DICOM are to achieve compatibility and to improve workflow efficiency between imaging systems and other information systems in healthcare environments worldwide [7]. A more complete description of DICOM is available at http:dicom.nema.org.HL7 is one of several American National Standards Institute (ANSI) accredited Standards Developing Organizations (SDOs) operating in the healthcare arena.  HL7 develops specifications.  The most widely used one being a messaging standard that enables disparate healthcare applications to exchange key sets of clinical and administrative data [8].     Dr. Eric Marks, Director of the DoD Center for Education and Research in Patient Safety, Uniformed Services University, cautioned that we should carefully consider the implications of mandated architectures and standards in terms of how they affect innovative technologies.  7. Conclusion.  Attendees at the 2008 Morningside meeting agreed that besides the technical advances there are other indicators that medical simulation and training technology is becoming an accepted tool for healthcare providers.The Society for Simulation in Healthcare (SSH), was established in 2004, and represents the rapidly growing group of educators and researchers who utilize a variety of simulation techniques for education, testing, and research in health care [9].  SSH membership exceeds 2,000 and their annual meeting is attended by representatives from over 20 nations.   The Advanced Initiatives in Medical Simulation (AIMS) was created in 2003 and is an industry council that seeks to highlight the importance of medical simulation for public policy makers who are addressing issues related to patient safety, medical errors, and health care costs as well as private policy makers who are seeking successful risk management strategies, incentivizing behavior change and ensuring high quality of care [10].Virginia Congressman J. Randy Forbes, founded and chairs the Congressional Modeling & Simulation Training Caucus which introduced the Enhancing Simulation Act of 2007 (H.R. 4321). This legislation extends the benefits of advanced medical simulation technology to the civilian health care system and will enhance the deployment of simulation technologies and the incorporation of such technologies and equipment into medical, nursing, allied health, podiatric, osteopathic, and dental education and training protocols [11]. These activities are further testament to the fact that simulation can and will be an effective education and training for healthcare providers in both the military and private sector.   8.
