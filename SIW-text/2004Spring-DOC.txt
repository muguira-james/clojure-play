The SIW includes a several working sessions addressing interoperability and reuse requirements and issues; tutorials on state-of-the-art methodologies, tools, and techniques; and exhibits presenting the latest technological advances.This year's Spring SIW is co-located with the Advanced Simulation Technologies Conference (ASTC 2004), sponsored by The Society for Modeling and Simulation International (SCS).  We will conduct a shared Monday evening reception and refreshment breaks, as well as shared exhibit space.  Anyone registered for either event will be free to attend any scheduled sessions.As further details become available, they will be posted at HYPERLINK "http://www.sisostds.org/siw/04spring/index.htm"http://www.sisostds.org/siw/04spring/index.htm2004 SPRING SIW FOCUS:  Modeling and Simulation of Asymmetric WarfareThe term "Asymmetric Warfare" is widely used to denote unconventional tactics used by insurgent or terrorist elements against a vastly larger military force.  These tactics are designed to make a disproportionately large impact on the effectiveness of the opponent using whatever unpredictable, indefensible and, frequently, illegal means are available.  Asymmetric threats include the use of weapons of mass destruction, attacks against non-military targets, use of suicide bombers, and so forth.  Traditional models and simulations of combat, whether focused on high-level force-on-force outcomes, or entity-level guerilla warfare, are inadequate for representing asymmetric engagements. Asymmetric interactions are inherently unpredictable and complex and difficult to model.  Adding to the difficulty is the tendency of an asymmetric threat to innovate and adapt to the changing military, political, and economic conditions, using any available resources. Modeling and simulation of asymmetric warfare is an important challenge facing the US and the world.  Most existing simulations were built to model a fairly well-defined range of symmetric opponents, principally engaged in formal, organized, conventional warfare.  For this workshop, we examine insights, approaches, and solutions to this challenge, to help us understand and prepare to meet this threat to global security.WORKSHOP SCHEDULEThe following schedule lists only major sessions and events.  Detailed schedules, including sessions and presentation times, will be posted on the SISO web site at HYPERLINK "http://www.sisostds.org/siw/04spring/index.htm"http://www.sisostds.org/siw/04spring/index.htm.Please check this web site frequently as the workshop approaches!SUNDAY AFTERNOON -- TUTORIAL SESSIONSSISO's "day before" tutorial program (held on Sunday, 14 September, 1:00 - 5:00 PM EDT) consists of three parallel sessions.  A $90 fee will be assessed for those registering for a tutorial to cover the costs of materials, equipment, facilities, and refreshments. Tutorial sessions include:(1)  HLA and FEDEPThis tutorial package contains two two-hour components:IEEE 1516 - The Future of HLA (Bob Lutz, Johns Hopkins Univ. Applied Physics Lab Reed Little, Carnegie Mellon Univ. Software Engineering Inst.)This tutorial provides insights into the IEEE 1516 version of the HLA and makes the case as to why organizations should move to this version vs. the HLA Version 1.3.  The tutorial starts with an overview of the HLA background and definition and then provides a summary of the HLA IEEE 1516 development process and highlights the improvements provided by the 1516 version.  Next a business case as to why a program should use IEEE 1516 instead of HLA 1.3 is presented.  The tutorial then ends with a discussion of what needs to be done to transition to IEEE 1516.  This tutorial is aimed at people who need to make an informed decision with respect to which version of the HLA they should use.  Some prior familiarity with HLA version 1.3 is assumed.Insights Into Federation Development Issues (Jake Borah, AEgis Technologies Group)This tutorial addresses distributed HLA Federation development issues.  Distributed simulation environments grow increasingly complex in modeling fidelity, scale, and diversity relative to the types of simulations, computing platforms, and networked locations. Distributed simulation environments consist of several components that must be configured and tested prior to a successful federation execution.  This tutorial will discuss how a network and its components, the Run-Time Infrastructure software, and simulation applications influence HLA federations.  The Federation Development and Execution Process model will be presented as a sound system engineering approach for creating a distributed HLA simulation environment.  Finally, the tutorial will highlight tools that can be used to document, troubleshoot, and enhance the performance of an HLA federation.(2)  Simulation of US and International Command, Control, Communication, Computing, and Intelligence Systems (C4I)     (Frank Karr, The MITRE Corp)This tutorial is designed to provide an introduction and overview to all aspects of C4I within M&S - from Modeling C4I to C4I Interoperability with M&S Systems. C4I is an increasingly important part of the Simulation-Based Acquisition Community (SBA), Concept Development, Experimentation, Testing, Decision Support and Operational Domains. Federated solutions to C4I/M&S interoperability will be described that reuse modular components of existing C4I and M&S. To be able to do so, this tutorial will introduce key Architectures, Data Models and other Standards/Components in both the C4I and M&S domains. A key goal of this tutorial will be to define a common vocabulary and introduce a taxonomy of the various uses of C4I within M&S. At the conclusion of this tutorial, participants will be familiar with the main uses of C4I within M&S, will be able to identify the key components and how they correspond, and will have the conceptual framework to assess and categorize C4I in M&S programs.(3)  Web-enabled M&S and the Global Information Grid (Dr. Andreas Tolk, VMASC; Johnny Garcia, GD/AIS; Dr. Michael Hieb, ALION)This tutorial covers the main technical requirements and constraints for writing new are migrating existing M&S functionality into web enabled services.  Such M&S web enabled services can be integrated into all kinds of web based distributed applications, such as distributed computer assisted exercises and experimentations, advanced distributed learning, and web based command and control.  The area of application focused in this tutorial is the application of M&S within Net Centric Warfare (NCW) and Joint Command and Control (JC2).  The infrastructure being the technical backbone for these applications is the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The tutorial will present the actual technical requirements and constraints of the GIG, gives an overview of management challenges, and shows various ways where and how M&S functionality can be integrated in a Community of Interest (COI) or as GIG Enterprise Services (GES)/Net Centric Enterprise Services (NCES).(4)  Synthetic Environment Data Representation and Interchange Specification (SEDRIS) (Farid Mamaghani, SEDRIS Associates)The Synthetic Environment Data Representation and Interchange Specification (SEDRIS) is a mechanism for representing the natural environment data found in a variety of simulation and non-simulation applications.  SEDRIS allows for the representation of the ocean, the ocean bottom, and ocean features (both natural and man-made); terrain and terrain features (both natural and man-made); 3-D models of vehicles, personnel, and other objects; the atmosphere, including environmental phenomena; and near space.  One of the SEDRIS objectives is to provide a mechanism for the unambiguous interchange of environmental data for every type of simulation application. This tutorial will focus on an overview of key SEDRIS technologies, including SEDRIS fundamentals, a brief status report on project activities, and highlights of standardization efforts in which components of SEDRIS technology are being proposed as SISO and International Standards Organization (ISO) standards.NOTE:  The SEDRIS tutorial may be presented Wednesday evening rather than Sunday afternoon.  Please check the SISO web site.MONDAY MORNING -- SPECIAL SESSIONS (8:30 - 12:00)Newcomer's Orientation (8:30 - 10:00)The Newcomer's Orientation is designed for those who have not previously attended a SISO Simulation Interoperability Workshop.  Its goal is to help new attendees gain maximum benefit from the Workshop and from participation in SISO. In this session, we describe the structure of the Workshop, the overall organization of the Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization, and how to participate most effectively as a SISO member.  If this is your first Workshop, this is where you should be on Monday morning.SCS General Session (8:30 - 10:00)SISO members are invited to participate in the SCS General Session. SCS members are also invited to participate in the SISO Plenary Session from 1:30 - 5:00.Priorities for M&S Standards (10:30 - 12:00)This panel discussion is being held at various M&S conferences (e.g., SISO, SCS, ITEC, I/ITSEC).  Each session features a distinguished panel of experts from government, industry, and academia, who discuss mid-term modeling and simulation standards needs.  The panel discussion will be followed by audience discussion and feedback.  Results from each of these sessions will be compiled and briefed back to SISO and to key leaders in government, industry, and academia.MONDAY AFTERNOON -- PLENARY SESSION (1:30 - 4:30)Invited Plenary speakers includeAdm. Edmund P. Giambastiani, Jr., USN (USJFCOM) Commander, U.S. Joint Forces CommandAdm. Giambastiani recently assumed command of USFJCOM.  He oversees the command's mission of leading the transformation of the Armed Forces of the United States.USJFCOM is responsible for U.S. military transformation activities through joint service concept development, experimentation, and joint service integration and interoperability.  The command is also responsible for joint military training and provides 1.1 million continental U.S.-based conventional combat ready forces for worldwide deployment.The admiral has recently served as Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Resources, Requirements, and Assessments, and as senior military assistant to Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld.Richard Kass, Analysis Division Chief, US Joint Forces Command J9 Joint Concept Development and ExperimentationMr. Kass will describe how USJFCOM is integrating the new DoD JWARS simulation into a model-experiment-model program and employing an adjunct model from academia to incorporate the effects of economic, social, and diplomatic interventions into the JWARS military campaign.SISO Standards Activities ReportThe Plenary session will also include brief status reports on current and planned SISO standards activities.MONDAY AFTERNOON -- SISO/SCS SOCIAL (5:00 - 8:00)A joint SISO/SCS Social will immediately follow the Plenary Session, adjacent to the Exhibit Area.  Food and drink will be available, subsidized by SISO Sponsors and Exhibitors.  The will be open.MONDAY EVENING -- SPECIAL SESSION ON COMPOSABILITY (7:00 - 9:00)The idea of "composing" models from components has been much discussed for many years, but results to date have typically been disappointing.  A recent monograph on this subject was sponsored by the Defense Modeling and Simulation Office.  Written by Paul Davis and Paul Anderson of RAND's National Defense Research Institute, this document presents an independent review of the issues involved in model composability, focusing largely on DoD applications.  It includes diagnosis of why model composability is so difficult (especially "substantive" composability) and suggests a systematic approach for improving prospects.  In doing so, however, it urges the Department of Defense to be more realistic in its images and expectations, to back away from excessive promises, and to recognize that substantive model composability is a substantially greater challenge than merely "connecting" models.  Success will require advances in related science, technology, education, and management.  Paul Davis will present a summary of the findings and recommendations.  This will be followed by an interactive discussion.  Further discussions will be held as part of the Synthetic Mission Spaces (SCS-COMPOSE) Forum on WednesdayTUESDAY MORNING AND AFTERNOON--USER COMMUNITY FORUMS (8:00 - 5:00)User Community Forums focus on topics that span specialty areas and are of broad interest to users within a particular area of M&S application. User Community Forums include* Analysis Forum (ANL), which focuses on the use of distributed models and simulations for analysis applications. * Research, Development, and Engineering Forum (RDE), which is concerned with the evaluation of alternative designs and research concepts as well as supporting specific engineering decisions within the RDE community. * Test and Evaluation Forum (TE), which focuses on comparing the performance of a system or its components with physical, technical, and operational performance requirements during acquisition and employment of the system. * Training Forum (TRAINING), which focuses on the use of simulations to provide individual and team training to system operators, team leaders, tactical decision makers, and strategic and theater-level planners. * System Acquisition and Product Development (SAPD), which focuses on the use of simulation in system acquisition and product development, for both military and non-military applications. * Medical Simulation (MED), which focuses on interoperability standards that build upon already extensive medical interface standards for operational systems for robot assisted surgery;    command & control systems for medical situational awareness;medical models of varying resolutions for research and development; training systems for instruction and rehearsal; imaging systems for treatment planning and assessment; and logistic planning systems for security and disaster response.TUESDAY EVENING -- INTERNATIONAL PROGRAM REPORTS (7:00 - 9:00)This session provides everyone the opportunity to hear and learn about goals, achievements, and issues arising from programs and projects around the world.  Presentations for this session are selected to provide the widest possible cross section of activities, with special emphasis on programs involving two or more nations.TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY -- SPECIALTY AREA FORUMS (8:00 - 5:00)Specialty Area Forums bring together specialists from different communities to discuss issues of simulation interoperability and component reuse.  The Specialty Area Forums are organized into five Tracks.INFRASTRUCTURE TRACK *The Communication, Frameworks, and Infrastructure Forum (CFI) focuses on technologies and techniques for constructing, utilizing, or extending the infrastructure that supports run-time interoperation and execution of distributed simulations.ENVIRONMENT TRACK *The Simulated Natural Environment Forum (SNE) addresses digital representations and models of the natural environment, including land, ocean, atmosphere, and space data.  SNE also focuses on issues and use cases relating to SEDRIS, environmental data classification systems, and coordinate transformation systems. *The Sensor Forum (SENS), which is co-administered by the C4ISR Track, serves as a bridge between environmental and mission/system-related areas, focusing on issues of interoperability, fidelity, and correlation for sensor simulations.DISTRIBUTED SIMULATION DEVELOPMENT TRACK*The Distributed Simulation Processes and Tools Forum (DSPT) is a consolidation of the Federation Development Process Forum (PROC) and the Exercise Management and Feedback Forum (EMF).  This Forum focuses on the Federation development and execution life-cycle process, including tools and methodologies for concept development, exercise planning, initialization, monitoring and control, data collection and repositories, visualization, analysis, and after-action review. *The Verification, Validation & Accreditation Forum (VV&A) deals with issues of credibility and appropriate use related to federation development and application.C4ISR TRACK*The Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) Forum is concerned with the interoperability of simulations representing command and control, communications, and intelligence.  Interests include coupling simulation systems with real C4I systems, models of C4I systems and the underlying infrastructure (nets, communications, data links, etc.).  Application domains include Computer Assisted Exercises (CAX), Simulation Based Acquisition (SBA), and operational use of Mission Rehearsal, Alternative Course of Action Analysis/Decision Support (ACOAA/DS), and After Action Review (AAR) Tools.*The Information Operations - Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (IO-ISR) Forum is concerned with the interoperability of simulations which represent (1) both the defensive and offensive aspects of Information Operations, to include Infrastructure Assurance, and (2) intelligence collection, processing, exploitation, production and dissemination, to include the various different intelligence disciplines (IMINT, SIGINT, HUMINT, etc.), including   representations at the national, strategic, operational, and tactical military levels, as well as non-military and commercial sources of intelligence.APPLICATIONS TRACK*The Vehicle/Weapon System Modeling Forum (VWS) focuses on the development and reuse of vehicle/weapon system simulations, including manned and unmanned weapons which operate in space, air, ground, and sea environments. *The Logistics (LOG) forum focuses on simulations and simulation challenges associated with modeling supply chains, logistics management processes, logistics policies and business practices, as well as the portrayal of logistics in military simulations at all levels. Topics of     interest include innovative approaches to supporting network centric operations, rapid deployment forces, Operations Other Than War (OOTW), global commercial operations, and enterprise process simulations. The latter include but are not limited to executable models of work flow, manufacturing, distribution, transportation and customer, patient, crowd, or traffic flow.WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY - STUDY GROUP AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT GROUP SESSIONSPlease check the final Workshop Agenda for a detailed schedule of Study Group and Product Development Group Sessions.  Most are meeting on Thursday morning or afternoon or Friday morning.STUDY GROUPSStudy Groups (SGs) are chartered when SISO wants to obtain recommendations on well-defined issues from groups of volunteer experts selected from appropriate Forums.  Study Group sessions at this Workshop includeAssessment of the Need for Product Data Representation Standards (ANPDRS SG)The data required to represent systems and products in M&S is broad and diverse, describing requirements, conceptual and physical design, manufacturing means, cost, system performance, and the product's operational and support environment.  The ANPDRS SG will review existing methods of representing product data, identify significant gaps in product data representation standards and ongoing activities to address these gaps, and, if warranted, recommend SISO product group(s) to begin formulation of needed standards.C4ISR/Simulation Technical Reference Model II (C4ISR TRM II SG)The C4ISR/Sim TRM II SG is continuing the work started by the original C4ISR/Sim TRM Study Group and creating a technical model that can be used as a frame of reference for interoperability between C4ISR Systems and M&S Systems.  By design, the TRM will facilitate analysis of requirements, architecture, design, implementation, and testing of heterogeneous systems. In addition, the TRM will support improved dialogue among users, developers, and technicians in the C4ISR community.  C4ISR/Sim TRM SG II tasks include a C4ISR/Sim TRM Use-Case study, the initial development of a TRM Sourcebook, and the initial development of a TRM User Guide.Common Image Generator Interface (CIGI SG)The goal of the CIGI SG is to evaluate industry and government interest in developing a standard image generator interface.  Typically, today's Image Generator (IG) vendors have their own closed, proprietary run-time interfaces. At I/ITSEC'02, Boeing proposed their Open Source Common Image Generator Interface (CIGI) as a run-time interface that could be adopted by the Simulation community.  Boeing indicated that they would like to see a standards organization adopt CIGI and develop it into a robust and broadly accepted simulation industry image generator run-time interface standard.  The SG will discuss this proposal, evaluate alternatives, and generate recommendations and a proposed action plan.DIS Study Group (DIS SG)The DIS Study Group is identifying design deficiencies and areas that need clarification related to the DIS 1278.1 standards. It will determine changes needed to the DIS standard and to the HLA RPR FOM to ensure that DIS implementations will remain compatible between simulators and with the HLA RPR FOM.  Specific action items include reviewing the DIS SG TOR objectives, agreeing on procedures and assignments to complete these objectives, discussing material that has been submitted to date, and agree on a timetable for formalizing proposed changes and presenting them at the 2004 Spring SIW.Extensible Modeling and Simulation Framework Profile (XMSF SG)The Extensible Modeling and Simulation Framework (XMSF) has several high-level requirements derived from years of experience with M&S frameworks and the challenges of their effective deployment across diverse networks and systems.  XMSF must enable simulations to interact directly and scalably over a highly distributed network, achieved through compatibility between a web framework and networking technologies.  The specification of XMSF will be in the form of a collection of profiles detailing how to interoperate with XMSF-compliant systems.  These profiles will enable inter- and intra-domain interoperability.  The initial profile content and structure must be agreed on.  As the underlying technologies and standards evolve, the profiles and will need to be upgradedto maintain interoperability.  The purpose of this SG is to determine the required scope for XMSF profiles and to define their structure.Intelligent Tutoring System Interoperability (ITSI SG)The ITSI SG is working on interoperability between components of simulation-based training environments that include Socratic and didactic tutoring and coaching, personalized After-Action Review (AAR) and performance assessment, management of individual or team curriculum progress, student modeling, natural language dialog interaction with intelligent agents, authoring tools for creating or modifying courseware objects and ITS behavior, and quantitative measures of training effectiveness.  The SG will draw on results from previous and concurrent efforts such as the Shareable Courseware Object Reference Model (SCORM), the Joint Modeling and Simulation (JMASS) Modeling and Simulation Reuse Library (MSRL),  and the JSIMS Learning Methodology Working Group (LMWG), as well as standards  developed by the Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C).Medical Federation Object Model (MED FOM SG)The MED FOM SG will hold its inaugural meeting during this SIW.   Medical simulation systems have unique technical, operational, and regulatory requirements and serve a broad array of users and customers.  Medical simulation increasingly needs interoperability standards that build upon already extensive medical interface standards.  The purpose of this Study Group is to identify categories of M&S applications needed by the health care community and to define relevant information exchange requirements.Open RTI Protocol (ORTI SG)The Open Run-Time Infrastructure (RTI) Protocol is a proposed communication and implementation standard for the High Level Architecture (HLA) RTI. Message formats and data handling algorithms for RTI services are encapsulated in an open, message-based protocol. The SG will investigate the applicability of the Open RTI Protocol, facilitating interoperability between RTI implementations and promoting Research and Development (R&D). The SG will solicit inputs government, academia and industry for feasibility and prototyping efforts.Simulation Conceptual Modeling SG (SCM SG)The Simulation Conceptual Modeling Study Group has been formed in order to conduct a preliminary investigation on the best practices of simulation conceptual modeling and to establish recommendations for pursuit of the topic within the scope of the SISO, if appropriate.  This session will have two invited presentations on conceptual modeling followed by group discussion on the following topics: review of the SCM SG TOR objectives; feedback from the Call for Data; resolution on the components for a Conceptual Modeling Framework; and planning for future work.Simulation Reference Markup Language (SRML SG)Discussion and presentations will be focused on technical and non-technical aspects of standardizing a simulation markup language and corresponding simulation engine specification based on the Simulation Reference Markup Language (SRML). We will be capturing the goals, needs, business case, and potential benefits to the simulation community, and summarizing the SRML survey. Additional discussions will relate SRML to HLA, BOMs, XMSF, MDA, and other emerging trends, as well as various forms of standardization.  Participants will have an opportunity to see Web-Based Simulation demonstrations, and discuss technical details.Transfer of Control (TC SG)The Transfer of Control SG is identifying design deficiencies and areas that need clarification related to the transfer control function. It will determine the changes needed to the DIS IEEE 1278.1a-1998 standard and to the HLA RPR FOM to ensure that transfer control implementations will be compatible between simulators.  Goals for this SIW include reaching agreement on a basic set of enumerations to be used for transfer control which will be submitted to the DIS Enumeration group; reviewing draft changes and clarifications to the issuance and receipt rules for the Transfer Control PDU and HLA interactions; discussing restoring entity ownership information to DIS PDUs and to the HLA RPR FOM; and agreeing on a timetable for formalizing the changes and presenting them at the 2004 Spring SIW.PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT GROUPSProduct Development Groups (PDGs) are approved to generate a specific SISO Product (Standards, Guides, and Reference Products) after approval of a formal Product Nomination.  Current Product Development Groups includeBase Object Model (BOM PDG)The major objective of the Base Object Model (BOM) Product Development Group (PDG) is to develop a functional specification, which can be used as a component-based standard to support composability.  This includes format and XML syntax specification for the basic BOM elements and ontology; identification of XML Schemas supporting other BOM dimensions as meta-data; guidance describing how the composition of individual BOMs for defining a simulation or simulation environment can be used to form Mega-BOMs.Environment Data Coding Specification (EDCS PDG)EDCS is a component of the Synthetic Environment Data Representation Interchange Specification (SEDRIS) that provides a data dictionary and coding standard for environmental data used in simulations of terrain, atmosphere, ocean, and space.Dynamic Link Compatible HLA API PDG (HLA API PDG)The Dynamic Link Compatible HLA API Product Development Group (PDG) will be developing a standard to define the requirements for Dynamic Link Compatible HLA APIs and methods for testing compliance.  This standard will be very useful to the distributed simulation community that uses the HLA and particularly useful to simulation developers that have to participate in multiple Federations using different RTIs. Use of the Dynamic Link Compatible HLA APIs will also support Federation managers in assembling Federates.   The PDG plans to define standard C++ and Java APIs for HLA 1.3 which will be based on the current APIs.  Additionally, alternative C++ and Java APIs will be created for the IEEE 1516.1 HLA. The 1516.1 APIs will be a SISO extension to the IEEE standard.Link-16  (Link-16 PDG)Link 16 is one of the critical components of interoperability in the Allied forces.  There are immediate operational requirements for existing and future military simulations to exchange Link-16 data using a single interoperable standard.  This group is developing a SISO standard to define the methods to simulate a Link-16 Network within Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) and High Level Architecture (HLA) frameworks. At the Fall 2003 SIW the Link-16 PDG will conduct a final review of the draft standard before submitting it to balloting.Real-Time Platform Reference Federation Object Model (RPR-FOM PDG)Version 1.0 of this Reference Federation Object Model was the first SISO standard, capturing the functionality of IEEE 1278.1-1995.  RPR FOM 2.0, currently under development, will add the functionality of IEEE 1278.1a-1998. The PDG will continue work towards readying the FOM and GRIM for community balloting.  Time will be given for status updates on both the FOM and GRIM, as well as a chance to work through open issues.VVA Overlay to the FEDEP (VVA FEDEP PDG)The VVA FEDEP PDG will begin by developing an initial process model for the overlay using 03S-SIW-085 "VV&A Process Overlay for the FEDEP" and the work being done by NATO TG016 as the foundation.  Lessons learned from past and ongoing federation activities (e.g., 03S-SIW-076 "Guidelines for Conducting VV&A of Simulation Federations") will be used to mature the overlay.  In parallel, the group will look to leverage efforts that are under way to advance the state of VV&A technology, such as the work being done by DMSO to assess the anomalies that can occur as a federation is integrated -- leading to problems in substantive interoperability. The proposed product will address substantive interoperability (issues associated with the meaningfulness of the data, sometimes referred to as "fair fight" issues); reusability (an element of composability -- issues associated with reusing federates within different federation contexts as well as reusing federation results for different applications); and composability (the proposed product will facilitate the meaningful composition of simulation components).NOTE:  NO FRIDAY MORNING OUTBRIEF SESSION   In order to maximize the time available to Study Groups and Product Development Groups, the Conference Committee has eliminated the Friday morning Outbrief Session, replacing it with a consolidated summary report from the Chairs of each Forum to be posted on the web site the week after the Workshop.  The report summarizes the key points raised and insights reached, as well as specific recommendations for future SISO Workshops and Standards activities.  This approach seemed to work well at the 2003 Fall SIW, and will be continued.All Forum, SG, and PDG Chairs will meet for breakfast Friday morning to discuss high-priority action items arising from the Workshop.INTERNATIONAL PROGRAM BRIEFINGS International and multi-national programs are invited to present brief reports on their current activities and plans.
