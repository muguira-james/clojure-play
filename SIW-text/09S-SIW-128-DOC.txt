federatesIntroduced W3C State Chart XMLCurrently W3C working draftBased on Harel state charts and UMLConclusions:Additional work is necessary in the following areas:Additional state control patternsTaxonomy for variants of patternsStandardization of custom actions and events for the M&S domainsWhen State Chart XML matures to a W3C standard additional execution environments will be available for Java (Apache Commons) and C++ (Sidema) Comments from 09S-SIW- 076, “Discovery and Reuse of Modeling and Simulation Assets” ( 22 attendees):Need for consistent discovery metadata for reuse of M&S assets Examine/exploit the “metadata within the markup”Producers and consumers need a common way to label and describe M&S resourcesMSC-DMS schema may be an answerConclusions:MSC-DMS Schema is a way to describe resourcesM&S Catalog is a way to search across the enterpriseAttendees need to conduct searches to identify useable items for MSC-DMS SchemaComments from 09S-SIW-063, “Design and Development of a Simulation Environment in OPNET Using High Performance Computing” (20 attendees):Problems in building federations: Built on the professional experience of experts Difficult to create large federations while ensuring optimal performanceLack of detailed architecture and design guidelinesUnavailability of tools and implementation software to minimize human interactionGoals:Creation of simulation models of various federations to characterize network behavior of federationCreation of an extensible design for future functionalityProposed to create a simulation environment and generate initial simulations with aim to make intelligent decisions about the design and deployment of simulation federationsLeveraged Verification Event/Operational Readiness Event (VE/ORE) exercise data for WARSIM and created a model for OPNETInteraction file contained time-stamped data logs of interactions Object file contained object attribute updatesInitially started with JDIF architecture, but ran into problems and switched to WARSIMConclusion:The data generated by the simulation environment helped the researchers to make intelligent decisions about the design and deployment of simulation federations Comments from 09S-SIW-008, “Execution Management Solutions for Geographically Distributed Simulations” (33 attendees):Management of distributed HLA federations is not straightforwardIssues include: Data distribution and data collectionStarting, stopping and monitoring of remote applicationsAmount of data generated and loggedSoftware and network stabilityNetwork latencyTime synchronizationTime zone differencesSecuritySituational awarenessRobust and reliable tools are critical to the success of running a distributed HLA federationTools should be highly automatedConclusions:A need exists for an integrated solution for all federation execution management tasksCurrent tools do not provide sufficient federation performance monitoring capabilitiesFuture tools should support a common document format for specification and exchange of state diagrams for federation state control. Comments from 09S-SIW-048, “A Flexible, Robust Force Building Tool For Supporting Scalable, Widely-Distributed Simulations” (19 attendees):Part of BLCSE: Task Organization Building Tool meant to replace existing methodSpreadsheet that was manually intensive, error-prone and difficult to reviewDesigned Force Structure Builder (FSBuilder) to:Reduce Task Organization development timeReduce errorsProvide custom TOsBe responsive to changing requirementsProvide a centralized repository for all things TO relatedEasy to learn/useFacilitate cross-attachmentWritten in Java, using Microsoft SQL Server for RDBMSUsing Military Scenario Definition Language (MSDL) filesFuture developments will improve upon multi-user capabilityConclusions:Traditional task organization development is slow, tedious and error-proneNewer tools minimize some problems, but do not allow for complete customizationFSBuilder was designed to allow for rapid, accurate task organization development and distribution across multiple federatesComments from 09S-SIW-065, “Design of a Bioterrorism Crisis Management Simulation for Preparedness and Response” (14 attendees):Homeland Defense federation led by JHU APL as a Preparedness and Catastrophic Event Response (PACER) project:24 Institutions under a renewal of 3 year contractThe scenario occurs in Baltimore with aerosol disease spread during concert eventParts of scenario cannot be simulated in real time, other parts can be executed faster than real-timeSimulation requires and accomplishes the integration of six major simulation componentsSimulation is designed to permit excursions varying the vales of key parameters Specific aims are to:Develop a unifying framework for integrating and applying the most promising M&S tools availableIntegrate selected sets of simulations into interoperable simulation federationsMake tools available to policy-makers, public health professionals, and other end-users to support decision-making and to identify specific training and educational needsConclusion:The current simulation is the second prototype establishing the capability of the PACER M&S Integration FrameworkIntegration and execution is planned for May/June 2009 at JHU/APL Comments from 09S-SIW-031, “Common Object Model Components: A First Step Toward LVC Interoperability” (55 attendees):An object model is frequently used in distributed simulation to specify how data is exchanged at runtime Multiple integrating architectures exist and need to interoperate:These architectures employ disparate object modelsThe disparate object models are a major source of interoperability problemsNo single reference object model will meet the needs of the broad DoD M&S communityThe goal is to seek a “single object modeling methodology” that is centered upon achieving composabilityA common object modeling approach offers the following advantages:Reduce/eliminate duplicate effortsEncourage re-use of Object Model componentsSupport use of common tools and methodologiesSupport conceptual modelingSupport extension of multiple models from single object model sourceSupport higher interoperability levels through the use of well defined semanticsConclusions:Object model incompatibilities represent one of the main barriers to achieving long-term simulation interoperability goalsCompositional approaches are needed to improve the efficiency of object modeling processes and to increase reuseThis is pathfinder program intended to define and implement advanced techniques for object model composabilityMany years will be required to build the envisioned library of standardized reusable object model components Comments from 09S-SIW-056, “Design Space Mapping Pilot” (19 attendees):The goal was to develop and integrate an executable SysML avionics models into operational air vehicles for requirements analysis and design solution assurance M&S is not yet at the core of product development processesSimulations of air vehicle and subsystems are in common use but results are not available to affect the design processThis simulation was built to leverage a existing design evaluation trade study meant to evaluate designs for terrain following and avoidance capabilitiesThis simulation demonstrated that:Cost effective detailed executable design models can be builtQuantitative analysis results can be obtained from such modelsQuantitative analysis results can be incorporated into the design processConclusions:Building and assembling models, collecting simulation data, and performing analysis is relatively inexpensive:This simulation framework is reusableThe avionics architecture is reusable via specializationThe execution architecture is scalable Comments from 09S-SIW-077, “Inconsistency, Neglect, and Confusion: A Historical Review of DoD Distributed Simulation Architecture Policies” (56 attendees Joint with CFI):U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has repeatedly issued policies regarding distributed simulation architecturesInconsistency among these policies and neglect in their application have:Sown confusionGiven rise to multiple architectures (DIS, HLA, TENA, etc.) being usedConcerns about capability & cost implications of this situation were the catalyst for the LVC Architecture Roadmap StudyHistorical review provides timeless lessons about effectively leading technology transitions across vast enterprisesConclusions:The current multiple-architecture situation arose not because of divergent requirements, but because the EXCIMS Chair, the EXCIMS members, and the DMSO failed to follow the 2000 HLA policy they had advocated and to which they had committedIt takes a long time, perhaps 10 years, to transition an LVC distributed simulation user community to a new architecture; consistency, effective communication, and strategic patience (persistence) over the long term are essentialThe high-rate of leadership turnover within DoD, with its attendant loss of corporate memory, erosion of consensus, and desire to establish new initiatives, makes persistence unlikely absent extraordinary effortsComments from 09S-SIW-081, “Experiences with an Integrated Live Airborne Federate Within a Distributed Mission Simulation (43 attendees Joint with CFI and SMAS):Project goal was to design, develop and integrate a functioning virtualized cockpit within a real aircraft that could fully participate with a simulated environment during flightProject used:Operator Performance Laboratory at the University of IowaA Fully instrumented Beech A-36 BonanzaA Fully instrumented Aero L-29 DelphinA Boeing 737 full cockpit simulatorA F-35 Joint Strike Fighter simulatorA CAAS rotocraft simulatorA GA aircraft simulatorThis study integrated Live, Virtual, and Constructive assetsThis approach achieved cost savings while obtaining an enhanced training environmentConclusions:Future challenges ahead:Greater safety through better delineation of virtual and real environmentsCognitive analysis of pilots in blended environmentsImplementation of physical switches and radio traffic in blended environment Comments from Invited Presentation, “HLA-Evolved PDG Status” (37 attendees Joint with CFI):Discussed recirculation ballot plans 11 Sep 2009 REVCOM targeted for approval Comments from 09S-SIW-083, “Early Experiences from Migrating to the HLA Evolved C++ and Java APIs” (25 attendees Joint with CFI):Presentation attempted to answer these questions:How were the HLA Evolved APIs designed?How will a federate that uses the HLA Evolved APIs appear?What were some of the experiences gained from migrating to the HLA Evolved APIs?  Experiences and Discussion:The Connect call has to be added to all federates before joiningThe “supplemental information” data structure reduces implementation effort as well as the risk for missing some callbacksThe addition of standardized time makes it easier to do time management and reduces risk for some mistakesNow there is a proper way for federates to detect if they are still connected to the federationMany new features for flexibility, discoverability and transparency makes it great for example for tools:Conclusions:Designing APIs for HLA Evolved has been a major undertakingAPIs need to be correct, consistent and easy-to-useA number of C++ and Java federates have been migrated to HLA Evolved in one to five daysGeneral tools take longer time to migrateMigration code samples have been collected from these effortsCode with extensive comments are provided in the paperThe HLA Evolved APIs provides considerable improvement for existing functionalityMore importantly: they introduce a new level of flexibility, discoverability and transparency. Comments from 09S-SIW-071, “Distributed Debrief Under the Navy Aviation Simulation Master Plan” (15 attendees Joint with CFI):The Distributed Debrief Control Protocol Study Group is studying the need for a distributed debrief standardThe NASMP distributed debrief standard might be a suitable solution The NASMP Distributed Debrief standard is intended for use in unit and mission level common exercisesThere is a infrastructure to conduct a common exercise debrief over a WANTechnical considerations for a distributed debrief are:Distributed debrief controlInformation AssuranceTime SynchronizationNetwork bandwidth Recommendation:The NASMP Distributed Debrief standard be considered as a start point if a distributed debrief standard is needed.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)26Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)55Peak attendance
