Evolving to Network Centric Exercises pose considerable challenges (05S-SIW-165)2.	HLA DDM Rectangles sometimes provides poor approximations for sensor footprints, and users should be aware of methods to reduce approximation error (05S-SIW-061)Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)20Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)30Peak attendance (including joint sessions)30Total papers presented11“No-show” presentations1Other presentations and panel discussionsRecommended Reading List nominations (including previous nominations):1.	05S-SIW-0612.	05S-SIW-1703.   05S-SIW-1652005 SPRING SIW OUTBRIEF FORM
