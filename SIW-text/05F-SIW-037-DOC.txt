A key component for training is ensuring the battlespace environment is accurately represented and that the representation is sufficiently robust to allow realistic simulations used in the training.  This same environmental representation will also be used for mission rehearsal and mission planning for the forces that make up the FCS UA. This paper describes how the Training IPT reviewed pertinent, TRADOC manuals, and official and unofficial After-Action Reports of the current fighting in Iraq for urban requirements.  The initial part of this study was done for RDECOM under the SVDR contract and is called Urban Requirements Analysis (URA).  Once these requirements were identified, the URA was compared with an existing list of urban requirements that the training community had developed for the OneSAF program.  While it was believed that the OneSAF program requirements were comprehensive, they did not have the pedigree of being directly linked to US Army requirements documents, training manuals, and operational Field Manuals.  Therefore, the requirements found in the FCS and TRADOC manuals were compared with the OneSAF urban requirements and three reports were developed.The first report showed all the matches of OneSAF requirements to what was found in a manual.  Thus, the OneSAF requirement was then provided a pedigree.  The other two lists were those requirements that did not match, either because a URA requirement did not have a corresponding OneSAF requirement, or vice versa.  For the first case this resulted in a list of potential “additions” to the FCS training requirements list that is not currently a OneSAF requirement.  The last report is the list of requirements that while they are valid requirements of the current OneSAF, are potentially not required by FCS.  Therefore, this list will have to be adjudicated by the FCS Geospatial Battlespace Environment Working Group to determine if these items will be left in the requirements or not. IntroductionThe Future Combat Systems (FCS) program is identifying the promising systems and technologies for achieving the Army's vision of fielding a "Future Force.” The Future Force is the Army's full spectrum force; organized, manned, equipped and trained to be more strategically responsive, deployable, agile, versatile, lethal, survivable, and sustainable across the entire spectrum of military operations. FCS tactics will enable the Future Force to see first, understand first, act first and finish decisively as the means to tactical success.  This program will be a multi-functional, multi-mission re-configurable system of systems to maximize joint inter-operability, strategic transportability and commonality of mission roles including direct and indirect fire, air defense, reconnaissance, troop transport, counter mobility, non-lethal and C2 on the move. The goal of this effort is to develop a network centric advanced force structure, quantify its benefits and identify materiel solutions and technologies within the context of that force.  To achieve this goal of interoperability and commonality across the FCS, there is a requirement for a common environmental representation.For many years, the U.S. Army has focused its environment efforts on the terrain.    This common environment also means that the operators and trainers will be using the same environmental representation.As mentioned above, the FCS identified the environment as an area that spans all domains and they must be defined.  To that end the FCS Geospatial Battlespace Environment (GBE) Working Group (WG) has the charter to define the problem space and in concert with the FCS IPTs identify the requirements that must be met.  The FCS GBE WG under the auspices of the FCS Functional Decomposition Functional Allocation (FD/FA) effort developed the definition of “geospatial” that would apply to the FCS and meet the FCS requirement of the total environment.  That definition is:“Mission-relevant, earth-referenced data pertaining to air, land, sea, and space.”The above definition includes the urban environment.  BackgroundThe US Army is going to fight many of its toughest battles in urban areas as illustrated by the current fighting in Iraq.  As the world becomes more urban, and the US finds itself fighting unconventional forces, this arena of warfare will become even more prevalent.  The Army needs to be able to train in these urban areas in live, virtual, and constructive scenarios.  In addition to training in these areas, the Army needs to be able to conduct realistic mission planning and mission rehearsal.  In order to support realistic Training and Enhanced Mission Planning and Rehearsal (TEMPR), the background simulation must have good representations of the necessary terrain, urban landscape, and weapons (this includes non-traditional weapons like a sledgehammer) for both the live trainees and Computer Generated Forces (CGF). Why the StudyThe goal of this effort is to provide detailed requirements for the content (features and attributes) of simulated urban environments.  Because urban environments are used within a broad range of simulations, spanning from constructive to virtual, from strategic bombing to individual combatants, it was necessary at the start to set the focus of this effort at one level of detail.  With that in mind, it was decided to address a level of detail appropriate to virtual simulation involving individual combatants.  Thus, the resultant requirements are highly detailed.What is needed to determine the actual requirements for the simulation is a detailed look at not just Field Manuals that describe how to fight in the urban landscape, but also the after-action reports and anecdotal evidence of what techniques work and which ones do not.  This information can then be used to determine what elements must be present and adequately modelled in realistic TEMPR simulations.  This study will allow developers to relate specific elements in their simulation to specific requirements, and therefore customers, in the documents.  For possibly the first time the program managers will be able to state that they need to have roof construction type modelled not just because it seems to be a neat idea that someone probably needs, but that Multiservice Procedures for Aviation Urban Operations (FM 3-06.1/MCRP 3-35.3A/NTTP 3-01.04/AFTTP(I) 3-2.29) specifically states that detailed roof construction type is needed to determine if the roof is adequate to support helicopter landings in building assaults. The information is needed for both visual and CGF representations so pilots in training can learn to make visual judgments that are reinforced by the results of landing in the simulation.  In other words, if the roof looks like it should not support the chopper and yet it still attempts to land, the chopper breaks through the roof.  That teaches the pilots to make judgment calls to land or not to land.  Similarly, the CGF entities cannot be seen to land on a roof which the manned simulators cannot.  Another example is if the trainee sees an object in the gutter and kicks it--rather then inspects and determines what it is--there is a possibility that it is a booby trap that explodes and kills or maims the trainee in virtual space. ApplicabilityThis study is designed to document the known requirements for the urban battlefield and as such the main result for this is a requirements database.  This paper is only intended to provide context and rationale for how the database was built, while pointing out some of the insights we gained while documenting the requirements. This study is useful in many ways.  First and foremost it is documentation of the specific requirements underlying the stated needs of the Army for urban warfare TEMPR.  Since this database only states documented requirements, and does not list implied requirements, this database can be used as a cross-reference to justify expenditure of funds to satisfy any specific requirements derived from the needs outlined in this database.  It is always difficult to justify spending on satisfying needs that are just “well we know the troops need this because we heard ……”  It is much easier when it is “well we know the troops need this because in NY Times, 14 April 2004 Capt Johnson said they used broken glass as an early warning device.”  Therefore, future urban simulations must have the capability for soldiers to scatter glass so they learn it works. This study also compared its results to OOS EDMs so it can be used to add the weight of documentation to the much more detailed EDMs.  As described in a paper by Dobey and Eirich (SIW paper 04S-SIW-114, April 2004 entitled Environmental Data Models: Necessary but Not Sufficient for Interoperability) EDMs are actually more like data requirements and not necessarily data models and as such they can do a good job of establishing undocumented (but probably valid) requirements.  Therefore, just because we did not find all the OOS EDM requirements in our sources, that does not mean they are not requirements.  On the other hand, there are some requirements that we captured that are not part of the EDM requirements.  This could be for several reasons.  First is that we documented some requirements that may or may not be environmental representation requirements since they blur the line between models (behaviours and effects) and the environment, but we felt this was a good place to document those requirements.  Second is that we tended to look at things from the soldier’s point of view and not from what OOS needs to do the job at an implementation level.  An example of this is that we found a requirement for soldiers to be able to ascertain and utilize building information based on a simple letter categorization so that the information can be integrated in the Joint Intelligence Preparation of the Battlespace (JIPB) (see table 1).NameStructural ConstructionDescriptionBuilding construction is assessed using these categories during the joint intelligence preparation of the battlespace (JIPB).Requirement TypeObject RequiredNotesThe categories are: Dense, random construction (Type A), Closed-orderly block construction (Type B), Residential area construction (Type C), Highrise area construction (Type D), Industrial/transportation construction (Type E).  Intel troops need to be able to recon and identify, and combat troops need to know which category and the weapons effects need to agree.SourceJoint Publication 3-06SourceJoint FM 3-06.1Table  SEQ Table \* ARABIC 1.  Structural Construction by Category RequirementThat is the requirement that we recorded.  However, in order for the soldier to ascertain the category of the building based on a simulated visualization they probably need the level of detail of the EDM requirements.  We did not have the time and budget to always be able to make these connections, but we did our best.Methodology of the StudyHow was the Database BuiltThe database was built in several steps and is actually a combination of two databases.  The original database was the result of work done under another an SAIC contract with the National Guard to do first responder requirements for possible terrorist attacks.  This is included in the final database because many of their requirements are potential Army requirements.  The second part of the database is based on whatever documentation we could find that might have any relevance to urban high resolution requirements.  There is a list of the main items we reviewed and can be found in the urban requirements report done for the Simulation and Training Technology Center under contract number N61339-02-C-0057, but it is not presented here.  It does not include all the miscellaneous items we reviewed such as news reports, speeches, congressional testimony, and other informal items we reviewed that did not produce anything new. We did not want to limit the study to just official Army publications since we did not feel that would adequately benefit from the current activities in the ongoing struggle in Iraq.  We therefore scoured the Internet for any unclassified (since this is an unclassified study) after-action reports, speeches, letters, articles, etc. that describe what it is like to fight in the cities of Iraq.  “One of the most important tools for this battle comes from the garden shed: sledgehammers. On Wednesday, marines punched "mouse holes," just big enough for gun barrels, in the brick walls of the homes they occupied. They also smashed windows to scatter shards of glass across the front steps.”  “It's an early warning system," Capt. Shannon Johnson explained, as he crunched noisily across the glass, "something the old guys taught us.”  New York Times 14 April, 2004.  While the use of sledgehammers to create mouse holes was discussed in the training manuals, the use of broken glass as an early warning device was not uncovered as a possible tool in our search.  Simulations must account for broken glass as both a friendly and unfriendly early warning device.  We also did not try to differentiate between different resolutions of the requirements under the assumption that there really is not a difference between high, low, and medium resolution requirements except that what we consider low are probably the ones we already account for in simulations, medium is what is currently being written into simulations, and high is what is hoped for in the next generation of simulations and TEMPR applications.  Similarly, high resolution to one simulation application may be low resolution to another.  Is a sledgehammer high, medium, or low?  Therefore, we did not attempt to do any classification (or exclude anything) based on high, medium, or low resolution. What is in the DatabaseAs pointed out above, the requirements database includes not only the terrain and structures, but also the elements that clutter the battlefield.  For example, it includes rubble for blocking vehicles, wet blankets for fire protection, and curtains for hiding snipers.  The study does not attempt to make the distinction of what simulation 3-D models, objects, and associated behaviours/effects are considered part of the environment and what are not actually parts of the SNE.  Because there is still a lot of debate on what constitutes the environment or what is “battle space objects”, we tried to err on the side of too much.  Ignoring things in this database a particular user does not consider part of the environment is far easier than another user having to add things later.  If particular users do not consider sandbags as part of the environment then they can ignore those elements.  It is also interesting to note that there seems to be far more requirements for these objects and effects then there are for what we traditionally consider being the environment.This study also made the conscious decision to include effects requirements that also may not technically be a SNE requirement.  This was done for several reasons.  First and foremost they were left as is because without input from the people responsible for that effect we cannot accurately determine what environmental elements are required to support that effect.  For example, we may know what the environmental elements are that go into the atmospheric transmission models used in simulations, but due to simulation system constraints they may not perform a rigorous calculation and therefore we do not know if they actually need all the environmental parameters to calculate transmission loss for their application.  In fact, some simulations merely use a look-up table for transmission loss and therefore need very few environmental inputs.  Secondly we want to have something that the FCS terrain team can use as a sort of checklist that forces them to make sure someone is responsible for satisfying that requirement.  All too often everyone thinks someone else is addressing a particular requirement and therefore no one addresses the problem.We also compared and contrasted the results of our study with the EDM work done for PEO-STRI and RDECOM and also compared our results to SEDRIS.  We did this for several reasons.  One of them is to show that there are requirements that we did not capture in our study.  These could eventually be included if they can be validated by users in some form.This study also does not claim to be totally complete.  There are elements within the EDMs that are most likely desired by the users/customers, but we did not attempt to second guess the documents that we reviewed and add those requirements.  If there was not a specific mention of a tactic within the Field Manual or other document, we did not consider that a requirement.  Nor did we incorporate individual simulation system requirements into this study.  Again, it is not to say that these are not valid requirements--only that we could not find a close match within any of the documents, speeches, letters, etc. that we reviewed.  We felt that both SEDRIS and the EDMs capture the vast majority of those requirements anyway.  We did make some effort to develop derived requirements, but we did not want to take that to an extreme because it is a slippery slope to start down and can soon lead to unrealistic requirements based on the reviewer’s particular background and biases.  We therefore only kept derived requirements that are obvious.  In addition, we did not try to breakdown the general requirements because of two reasons.  First, it was apparent that the majority of the more detailed requirements were already well covered by the various EDMs. Second, we did not want to start trying to second-guess the requirement and then add things that were never intended to be included.  It is interesting that a number of seemingly obvious requirements are not found in any of the documents we studied.  An example of this is the lack of any traceable requirement for “curbs” in an urban environment.  There are several different reasons for this.  The first is that it is just implied to be part of the environment and the second is that it just does not matter that much and is therefore not part of urban training.  For DI, armour, and aviation training normal curbs are just not all that important and therefore there is no reference in training and doctrine documents for troops to be concerned with the height of curbs.  However, it is obvious that although future requirements for things like Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) are not complete, they must have a need for that type of information.  Even current CGF simulations and driver trainers are concerned with things such as curb height.  However, we did not want to guess at requirements that may not yet exist or are specific to internal (implementation) needs of CGF simulations.  Therefore, we confined ourselves to requirements that can be traced to a specific training or doctrine manual, after-action reports, or other comments make by troops that have actually been involved in urban combat.ResultsGeneral Results of the StudyThe most interesting aspect to this study was the large number of requirements we found that are not really database requirements, but rather effects requirements that are associated with environmental requirements.  An example of this is the requirement for sniper positions.  While this may seem to be little more then a requirement for a window and a rifle, the training must include having appropriate objects available that are needed to provide positive training.  If the soldier has, and uses, items like sandbags for protection, furniture to create a rifle rest, curtains to hide behind, wire mesh to put over windows to protect from enemy grenades, etc., then the sniper needs to have the positive reinforcement that those items make him safer and more effective.  By the same token if they are available and he does not use them, then the CGF needs to be able to incapacitate him as a consequence of not using the items he is trained to use.  Therefore, while it is the environment needs to provide the items, they are useless if the CGF behaviours and effects are not robust enough to properly utilize them.  This is a particular area of concern for the more detailed requirements for urban environment content where many of these content requirements imply substantial functionality requirements for supporting models.  This problem is already seen in comparable requirements efforts, such as the OOS EDM.  In that case, requirements such as flow rate for air ducts imply the need for highly detailed propagation models.We also found that while most of these requirements came from training manuals and after-action reports, the C4I community is a very important source of information on what is needed in training and mission rehearsal systems.  If the intelligence troops think something is important enough to be reported, then it is probably something that is important to adequately represent in a simulation.  In addition, we need to be aware of how they report these features and account for that within simulations.  An example is the intelligence community’s codes for building construction which are based on several criteria, the most important being appearance.  Therefore, the environment must be extremely careful to make sure that a building that looks like a category A building should generally impact the simulation like a category A building.  By the same token, if the simulation is only for the assault troops, then the environment, in conjunction with the C4I database, needs to be able to tell the troops it is a category A building based on earlier reconnaissance and not just have a database with this highly detailed building that the assault troops have to categorize only when they actually see it.  This would prevent them from planning the virtual assault before encountering the building.Another interesting feature we found was that not very many requirements had specific resolutions or measurements associated with them.  For example, we saw no resolution requirement for window dimensions; yet the user is very concerned with modelling the things associated with the window such as curtains, wire mesh, available cover, glass/no-glass, etc.  This is probably for a couple of reasons.  The first is that we spent most of our time reviewing training and operations manuals and they tend to speak in broad terms, whereas for mission rehearsal they may need to know to a high-level of accuracy what the window dimensions are so they know if they can fire and/or enter through that window.  The second is that even when they do have mission rehearsal type requirements it will be hard to get any customer to clearly state what the accuracy requirements are for such elements….they rarely know there’s a problem until the mission rehearsal allows window entry, and when they assault the building under fire the windows are too small, and then it is too late.Compare and Contrast with the EDMsThe database was sorted by EDM reference—i.e. which EDM had a comparable feature and then sorted again by EDM feature.  This gives the reader an idea of the level of agreement between the EDMs used in this study and the requirements derived for this study from other sources.  This study shows that the OOS EDMs do a good job of capturing the urban requirements if you concentrate only on buildings and do not consider tools, effects, or subterranean requirements.  Effects are clearly outside the bounds of responsibility of the environmental community and tools are an area of debate among the various communities. However, subterranean areas are clearly part of the environment and need to be better modelled.As discussed earlier, the majority of items labelled as “none” in the EDM reference is due to the fact that this paper looked at items that probably do not belong in a environmental representation requirements document and therefore you would not expect to find them in an EDM.  Most of the rest are labelled as “none (too general)” or are first responder requirements that should eventually be part of any urban EDM, but so far the EDMs have correctly restricted themselves to the needs of the warfighter, both direct and support.However, there are some requirements that just did not seem to be included in the EDMs.  As a caveat, we would like to say that we tried to get any available new EDMs, but could not.  Therefore, some of these deficiencies may have already been addressed in later versions of the EDMs.  There is a listing of all the requirements that did not have a match.  Again, this could be due to the EDM not capturing a needed feature, or more often it is due to this requirements study including required effects models that may, or may not, be the responsibility of the environment teams on various M&S projects.  We decided to include elements that are probably not part of the traditional environment, but we decide to err on the conservative side and include objects such as the need for sledgehammers to allow trainees to break down doors in the same way that our troops in Iraq are currently employing.  These objects make up the majority of the ones not found in the OOS EDM with most of the rest consisting of requirements that are too general to fit into a single EDM.  Ideally, these “too general” requirements need to be broken down to more individual requirements, or the database modified to allow multiple matches.  Both of these tasks would take considerable time.Compare and Contrast with SEDRISWe sorted the features we found by SEDRIS features and is not much difference between the appropriate features in SEDRIS and the appropriate features in the EDMs.  Since the version of SEDRIS we used is newer then the EDM we used, there is some improvement in capturing the requirements.  As can be seen viewing the database, the results are very similar to the comparison with the EDM in that most of the differences between our requirements and what is already covered by EDCS are due to the requirement being either too general, or is actually an effects requirement.SummaryOne of the interesting findings is that there seems to be far more requirements for “things” and effects then there are for the traditional environment.  This is probably due to several reasons.   First is that users tend to take the traditional environment for granted and just assume that they are going to get at least some level of information in urban areas.  As a result, the users then emphasize the things they do not have currently.  Therefore, the majority of the real requirements are basically we should do what we are doing, but do it in finer detail: better, faster, and cheaper.  The second reason is that the sense the authors got while reviewing this large horde of documents and write-ups is that what the user really needs are realistic effects and the right “things” in the simulation that can be used for, or against, the troops.  The most accurate, high-resolution model of a building is useless for simulation if the doors do not perform like they should perform.  First the door must be accurately shown to open in the right way (inward or outward) and then just as importantly, the door material must be accurately depicted and modelled.  That is needed because if the trainee, or troop in mission rehearsal, learns through simulation they can breach a door with a standard 5.62 round and then when the real situation comes along it does not work, and they did not bring a sledgehammer or breaching round shotgun, they are in serious trouble.   Similarly, for a friendly sniper in training the most accurate model of the dimensions of an upper story room are not as important as having realistic “things” available for them to learn how to utilize shear curtains, sand bags, wet towels, and the other tools to enhance survivability and effectiveness. What these results should be used for is a cross-check on simulation systems as they develop, or certify, their requirements for urban warfare.  For example, this database should be cross-checked with the requirements for FCS and any and all differences resolved by the responsible IPT.  This does not mean that every requirement uncovered by this study is a valid requirement for each system, but it does mean that it is an excellent tool to use to make sure the people responsible for both the environment, and the environmentally related effects, requirements have thought of everything.  In addition to the effects, this study also included things that a good training M&S system needs to include to truly train troops for fighting in the urban environment.  The system should include the ability to put wire mesh over windows to protect from grenades so the trainee survives if he/she puts up the mesh--and dies if they forget.  It needs to include actual or representative curtains for the windows and then have the trainee rewarded if they utilize shear curtains when setting up a sniper position, or the trainee get hit by an enemy sniper if they ignore the window with the shear curtain on it up above.  The environmental representation can only provide the curtains; it is up to the simulation to utilize them in a strong TEMPR system.Finally, the results of this study can be used to highlight the weaknesses in current source data and modelling tools for urban environments.  This is particularly critical for mission rehearsal scenarios where there is a need for urban environments to have attributes for a real world location.  For example, if construction standards in a particular target country are substantial different from those in the US, or countries where US troops have been recently engaged, it will be critical for mission rehearsal simulations to reflect this difference.  For example, civilian structures in Kosovo often have compound walls around them, making the initial approach to a structure very different due to limited visibility and limited access points.  This difference in approach due to construction methods needs to be planned and rehearsed so the troops do not have to find out the difference under fire.BibliographyDobey, V and P.
