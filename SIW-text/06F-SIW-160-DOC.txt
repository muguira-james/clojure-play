Panel Discussion“Human Behavior Representation in Modeling and Simulation Leading toward Test and Evaluation (T&E)”12 Sept 2006    1130-1200T&E Forum, Largo roomFall 2006 Simulation Interoperability WorkshopSimulation Interoperability Standards OrganizationThis panel will explore the workshop theme "Human Behavior Representation in Modeling and Simulation" focusing on specific use cases, tools and techniques that will impact T&E in some manner.  The panelists span the spectrum of Research, Development, and T&E.  Examples will show how human behaviors are imbedded in or interfaced with models and simulation (M&S) and their eventual impact upon the T&E phase.Invited PanelistRandolph Washington is a systems engineer at DCS Corporation in Alexandria Virginia. He supports DCS efforts in knowledge engineering and human behavior representation. He earned a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from The Ohio State University.  Mr. Washington will be discussing Human-Centric Modeling and Simulation of Network-Enabled Battle Command.At the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Dr. Gordon Long is the current Joint Integrated Mission Model (JIMM) model manager.  He has been a computer engineer at NAVAIR since 2001.  Prior to becoming the JIMM Model Manager, he was the lead systems engineer for NGTS, a model used in training simulations.  Dr. Long obtained his Ph.D. in High Energy Physics from the University of Maryland College Park in 1996 for work performed at the European Center for Nuclear Physics (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland.Jeffrey Thomas is an electronics engineer with the Army Test and Evaluation Command's Electronic Proving Ground stationed at Fort Lewis, Washington.  He began his government service at White Sands Missile Range with instrumentation development after graduating from New Mexico State University, and is now a member of the Army Acquisition Corps.
