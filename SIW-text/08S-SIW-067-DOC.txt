IntroductionGreat strides have been made in the implementation of the M&S Composability Paradigm [1, 2].  However, the Composability Paradigm can be enhanced with additional metadata and metadata sharing formats about M&S. This paper proposes development of standards for the expression and sharing of metadata and artifacts to support broader composability. An M&S maturity taxonomy that takes into consideration the M&S end-to-end lifecycle [4, 5] is needed to address metadata gaps.Also, the composability paradigm can be expanded to promote reusability and synergy for artifacts, an electronic media file targeted for reuse, associated with, but other than, M&S for the benefit of the Department of Defense (DoD) Simulation Based Acquisition [6, 14]. The proposed expansion of the composability paradigm includes roadmap artifacts, capability based analysis [9], architecture, initialization [7], scenario [10], and Validation, Verification, and Accreditation (VV&A) [8] artifacts.  A key aspect of reaching new levels of synergy and reuse is the development and use of standards to express and share the metadata and various artifacts proposed.2. Current Composability EffortsNotable composability efforts include within the DoD SBA Community include:DoD M&S Resource Repository (MSRR)Army MSRRPrimary Integrated Views of Modeling and Simulation (PIVOMS)The following sections provide a brief overview of these technologies.2.1 DoD MSRRThe DoD M&S Resource Repository (MSRR),  HYPERLINK "http://www.msrr.dmso.mil/" http://www.msrr.dmso.mil/, contains the following M&S metadata categories:Resource InformationGeneral InformationSecurityOperating EnvironmentsCapabilitiesPOC InformationUse 2.2 Army MSRRThe Army MSRR,  HYPERLINK "http://www.msrr.army.mil/" http://www.msrr.army.mil/, contains the following M&S metadata categories:Brief DescriptionHow to ObtainAdditional InformationUsing AgenciesHigh Level Architecture (HLA)VV&A Pedigree/DocumentationPoints of ContactSystem NotesAccess Restrictions Resource Relationships2.3 PIVOMSThe Army Test and Evaluation Center (ATEC) PIVOMS,  HYPERLINK "https://pivoms.atec.army.mil" https://pivoms.atec.army.mil, contains the following M&S metadata categories:Acronym	Full Name	Model Universal Resource Locator (URL)	Version	POC InformationProponent OrganizationModel Type (Constructive)Directions to ObtainSubcomponents or FederatesVV&A Status/PedigreeDescriptionLast ModifiedHowever, PIVOMS goes over and beyond most composability efforts in that M&S metadata, Event Engineering documentation (e.g. Measure of Effectiveness (MoE) / Measures of Performance (MoP)) [17], and VV&A artifacts are all accessible from the same site.3. Proposed M&S Metadata EnhancementsAs can be seen in the previous section, current composability efforts provide a narrow view of M&S resource maturity.  Specifically, only knowledge about the existence, usage, and VV&A of an M&S resource is available.  The SBA community could benefit from a more detailed view of M&S artifact Maturity within the context of the M&S resource selection (e.g. Federation Development and Execution Process (FEDEP) Activity 3.1 “Select Federates” [2]).In [14], a generalized SW Maturity Taxonomy was given and related to the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) as described in the Defense Acquisition Guide [15].  However, the extra dimension of M&S Composability was not explored.  As such, the author of this paper has endeavored to create a M&S Maturity Taxonomy as shown in Table 1 to address the SBA community needs.Table  SEQ Table \* ARABIC \s 1 1 M&S Maturity TaxonomyMaturity LevelMeaningRiskTRL1M&S resource has been plannedHigh1-32M&S resource has been systems engineeredHigh33M&S resource has been prototypedMed34M&S resource has been developedMed45M&S resource has been Validated and VerifiedMed5-76M&S resource has been used in an EventLow77M&S resource has been AccreditedLow88M&S resource has been used in the battlespace (fielded)Low99M&S resource is obsoleteN/AN/AAs can be seen in Table 1, a notion of the end-to-end M&S lifecycle has been selected that is appropriate to the aforementioned “Select Federates” process step.  Also, a categorization of relative risk [19] to Events using an M&S resource has been given.  The relationship of Maturity to risk has been conceptually depicted in Figure 1.Figure 1 M&S Resource Maturity vs. RiskThe proposed M&S Maturity Taxonomy allows Event planners to do a preliminary determination of usability in terms of availability and maturity without the need of direct talks with M&S resource suppliers.  Event planners would be able to target questions like:Use, wait, or make an M&S resource and with what level of risk?If the decision to use a particular M&S resource is done then will it be available in time for an event?What is the risk mitigation strategy and associated trigger dates?The M&S Maturity Taxonomy allows Event planners to select M&S resources form a much wider palette than currently given by the various resource repositories.  At the same time, Event planners would gain greater freedom in selecting the most proper course of action in selection.4. Proposed M&S Composability ExpansionAlthough Event planners would be able to target the aforementioned questions, to actually answer these questions requires M&S artifacts (e.g. roadmap, capability based analysis, architecture, initialization, scenario, and VV&A artifacts) that are currently not available directly from current composability efforts.  An Event planner would need to contact M&S resource suppliers and arrange for such M&S artifacts to be delivered or arrange discussions about them.  Having M&S artifact directly available from current composability efforts could significantly optimize interactions between M&S resource suppliers and Event planners.  Specifically, Event planners would need to only arrange discussions about M&S artifacts as necessary.  The point here is to expand the M&S Composability paradigm by adopting a “self-service” paradigm wherever possible for M&S artifacts. The presumption of course is that such M&S artifacts are developed with a significant degree of quality.The expansion of the M&S Composability paradigm is termed File Cabinet Concept in keeping with [16], see Figure 1.  Although the File Cabinet Concept was proposed by the Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM) under the Army Materiel Command (AMC) as early as 2005, this paper provides details as to its content, implementation by MATREX, and use cases as detailed in the following sub-sections. Figure 2 File Cabinet Concept4.1 Roadmap ArtifactsRoadmap artifacts detail the work scheduling intentions of an organization for M&S resources.  Such artifacts provide detail that is helpful to Event planners and may help in determining if an M&S resource will be available in time for use in an event.  It should be noted that there is an inherent high level of risk in using such information which can be mitigated by coordination between Event planners and M&S suppliers.  However, the sharing of Roadmap artifacts helps to ensure that multiple M&S supplier organizations from producing similar resources.Roadmap artifacts are particularly useful when considering M&S resources at the aforementioned Maturity Levels 1 to 3.  However, Roadmap artifacts determine when a particular Maturity Level will be reached and hence are useful to Event planners considering a resource at any Maturity Levels.4.2 Capability Based Analysis ArtifactsOperation of the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) [16] introduced the JCIDS analysis process commonly known as Capabilities Based Analysis (CBA).  In essence, the CBA is used to determine military operational and functional needs and associated prioritization [9].MATREX is tailoring CBA for use in describing military operational & functional M&S needs (i.e. the M&S needs for SBA) and operational and functional M&S needs (i.e. needs of personnel conducting events).  MATREX capabilities include priority information.MATREX is using CBA for M&S planning and M&S Requirements Decomposition [18].CBA artifacts are useful to Event planners in determining if an M&S resource meets or will meet the Assessment Objectives of an Event.  CBA artifacts are particularly useful when considering M&S resources at the aforementioned Maturity Levels 1 to 3.  Specifically, CBA prioritization information allows Event planners to determine risk and select the appropriate risk mitigation strategy (i.e. Avoidance, Reduction, Assumption, and Transfer) [19].It should be noted that for DoD programs not yet based on CBA, Requirements Development artifacts would serve a similar purpose than CBA artifacts.  On the other hand, prioritization of requirements may represent a significant burden on M&S suppliers depending on the quantity of requirements.  Capabilities represent a higher level of abstraction of needs that should be several orders of magnitude less in quantity compared to requirements.4.3 Architecture ArtifactsArchitecture artifacts can be represented with various frameworks, tools, and means.  For the purposes of this paper, we will base our discussion with DoD Architecture Framework (DoDAF) [20].MATREX in collaboration with Command Collaborative Effort (3CE) is endeavoring to decompose the Future Combat Systems (FCS) Integrated Process 01 [22] for Battle Command based on DoDAF views to analyze M&S needs.  Although this decomposition has been done by other organizations within the Army, it is not available the SBA community at large.  Fostering the reuse of such decompositions through a MSRR would greatly benefit the SBA community at large.Architecture artifacts are particularly useful when considering M&S resources at the aforementioned Maturity Levels 1 to 3.  However, Architecture artifacts are useful to anyone trying to determine the quality (i.e. the degree to which a set of inherent characteristic fulfills requirements) [21] of a particular M&S resource at M&S Maturity Level 4 to 9.4.4 Initialization Artifacts M&S Initialization artifacts often represent a significant investment of money, time, and resources by M&S suppliers and/or Event related personnel (e.g. FEDEP Activity 4.2 Establish Federation Agreements [2]) that can be reused for the benefit of the SBA community at large.It should be noted that total Initialization artifact reuse may not be possible because of the uniqueness of Event objectives.  Nevertheless, then Initialization artifact reuse via the use of these artifacts as templates has merit.3CE with MATREX help is developing simulation initialization tools and processes common to its stakeholders (i.e. Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC), RDECOM, and the FCS Lead Systems Integrator (LSI)) [23].  3CE’s simulation initialization effort represents an instantiation of Initialization artifacts reuse.  Standardization of Initialization artifacts can also further their reuse.4.5 Scenario ArtifactsLike M&S Initialization artifacts, Scenario artifacts represent a significant investment of resources by M&S suppliers and/or Event related personnel (e.g. FEDEP Activity 4.2 Establish Federation Agreements [2]) that can be reused for the benefit of the SBA community at large.It should be noted that total Scenario artifact reuse may not be possible because of the uniqueness of Event objectives.  Nevertheless, then Scenario artifact reuse via the use of these artifacts as templates has merit.  Standardization of Scenario artifacts can also further their reuse.  MATREX is placing under Configuration Management (CM) all its Military Scenario Definition Language (MSDL) based Scenario Artifact to benefit all its stakeholders.4.6 VV&A ArtifactsAlthough all MSRR have metadata about VV&A [24] artifacts, the VV&A artifacts themselves are only available under the PIVOMS MSRR.  MATREX is following the lead of PIVOMS and placing under CM all its VV&A artifacts for the benefit of all its stakeholders.It should be noted that MATREX VV&A artifacts include Systems Engineering documentation (e.g. DoDAF view), development (e.g. design specifications, SW user manuals) and testing documentation. (e.g. test description document, test report document).  During the course of Systems Engineering and V&V Architecture artifacts and Scenario documents are produced.  Therefore, an overlap of artifacts is extant which means that the aforementioned benefits are also applicable here.6. ConclusionWe have presented enhancements (i.e. M&S Maturity Taxonomy) and expansion (i.e. File Cabinet Concept) of the M&S Composability Paradigm.  These enhancements and expansion can be adopted for the benefit of the SBA community at large.  Specifically, the Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization (SISO) Military Scenario Definition Language (MSDL) Product Development Group (PDG) and Distributed Simulation Engineering and Execution Process (DSEEP) PDG can bring about some or all the benefits outlined in this paper.7.
