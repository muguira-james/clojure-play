In order to best satisfy military training requirements the simulation system designer needs an awareness of how the military operate, both at war and in training for war. The proponents of conceptual models argue that such models can enable this necessary awareness. The existence of a conceptual model of the Army could reduce the time taken to develop simulation training systems, and make those systems better fitted to their purpose. Building a conceptual model of the Army will take time, however, a key part of the model may already exist.The British Army has developed, during 4 centuries of war fighting, Principles of War and of Training. The Principles of War form part of the conceptual component of fighting power - the component that seeks to ensure that the army has the doctrine and organisation best suited to produce fighting power. Commanders at all levels receive education in the application of these Principles. Since the use of simulation systems in training essentially provides opportunities to practice such application, the systems’ designs would do well to reflect the Principles themselves. Since the manner of such practice would be guided by the Principles of Training, simulation systems should also reflect these Principles .The aim of this paper is to examine the Principles of War and the Principles of Training in order to ascertain a set of design characteristics for all simulation systems that are to be used to support military training. The paper seeks to provoke a discussion as to the feasibility of producing such standard characteristics, and to further improve communication between the users and developers of simulation based training systems. 1.   IntroductionNinety-five years ago Lord Robert Baden-Powell founded the Scout Movement and gave as its motto “Be Prepared”. That motto is highly relevant today for our armed forces as they engage in the war against global terrorism. Being prepared means being ready for action. Readiness calls for effective training and reliable weapon systems. Well designed simulation systems can play a starring role in enabling effective training. Weapon systems’ manufacturers have design principles and characteristics that have been developed, tried and tested over many years.  For a tank the principle is to find the optimum balance between the conflicting aspects of firepower, mobility and protection. Key characteristics include: achieving the required target effect, being easy for soldiers to operate, having sustainability in line with logistics’ doctrine, being comfortable to live in, and having a high availability. Note that to fulfill such design requirements necessitates the manufacturer knowing how the tankers operate.Similarly, in order to best satisfy military training requirements the simulation system designer needs to understand the concept of military operations and its application in training for war. The manufacturers of simulation systems have, however, no such helpful design characteristics. The National Simulation Centre’s Blue Book [1] specifies these characteristics for C2 training simulations:  realism, neutrality to the decision-making process, and enabling free-play. Given such requirements the manufacturer would not be restricted in his design, but whether or not the design would enable effective training would not be immediately evident. The need for design characteristics for simulation systems used for training is clear. They would be of great help to link military requirements writers to industry producers. Such a link has been described as a Conceptual Model [2]. This Paper examines how existing Military Principles can assist in formulating simulation design characteristics, and whether they are part of a conceptual model or not. 2.   The Requirement for SimulationFor much of the 20th Century the major military powers have trained for conflict that was predictable by nature: known enemy, known ground, known tactics, known equipment, known aims. This is all changing with breathtaking speed. The dispersed, multi-faceted, unpredictable, and asymmetric nature of future warfare will call for a more rapid and flexible use of forces. These forces will need utility across the whole spectrum of warfare. To enable this individuals and units will need careful and comprehensive preparation. For preparation read ‘Military Training’. Due to the complex nature of future conflict, more Military Training will be needed.The advanced nature of future weapons – there is no such thing as an unmanned system – will also increase the amount of training required. Dispersion and increased operational tempo are driving improvements to command and control through the digitization process. Digitization itself comes with a large training requirement; it is harder to master than semaphore.When not engaged on operations the military are increasingly finding that they have diminished resources available for Military Training. Money is scarce; fuel and ammunition are expensive; soldiers are involved in force protection. Environmental and health & safety issues restrict the size, scope and location of training. Large exercises restrict operational flexibility. The need to rest soldiers and to give them time with friends and families limits time available for training.It is clear that the army will do less training, but needs to be better trained. Training has to be more effective, it has to be tailored, available and deployable. Simulation can make training more effective. It has already shown that it can make training faster, better, and less expensive. The challenges now are to enable effective multi-echelon training, by for example connecting the live, virtual and constructive domains, so that the time needed to train the force can be reduced. Training will need to be repeated as forces change and skills erode. Training should require the minimum amount of supporting infrastructure and manpower. The challenge here is create effective embedded simulations that can meet the training requirement. The US Army’s Training System is being revitalized in order to produce a Force that is more strategically responsive and dominant across the entire spectrum of future conflict.  A key part of this training transformation is new Training Doctrine.  The Doctrine states that commanders must be provided with the necessary simulation systems. [3]The need for simulation to support Military Training is greater than ever before. But, because of increasing costs and increasing uncertainty, so are the needs to get the simulation systems fielded in good time and to make sure that they are fitted for purpose. The Need for Conceptual ModelsThe development and fielding of a simulation system to support training is a complex process. The theory of the process is well documented by several eminent academics. For example B.P. Zeigler in ‘The Theory of Modelling and Simulation’ established a 5 level hierarchy of elements ranging from the real system to a final computer model. [4]. The team of Banks, Carson and Nelson [5] defined a stepped development process from problem formulation to model translation. Both approaches identified the need for a conceptual model, primarily to aid effective communication between users, systems engineers, and modellers.The 6 step Federation Development and Execution Process (FEDEP), initiated by DMSO and further developed by SISO encapsulates the academic work and adds current practicalities. Version 3 of the FEDEP is close to being accepted as a member of the IEEE 1516, Standard for Modeling and Simulation (M&S) High Level Architecture (HLA), series of specifications. [6]. The UK’s Synthetic Environments Coordination Office, working in conjunction with the NATO Modelling and Simulation Office have further developed FEDEP into a Synthetic Environments Development and Execution Process (SEDEP), which is not confined to HLA federations. [7]. Both the FEDEP and SEDEP specify a conceptual analysis step, one of the outputs from which is a conceptual model. The step is seen as essential in order to translate the user requirements into a working technical design – i.e. produce workable design characteristics.There has been much discussion, particularly at recent SIWs about the role and definition of a conceptual model. F Haddix neatly identified 2 kinds of conceptual model [8]. A domain oriented one, written in plain English and understood by the military user, and a design oriented one, written by the systems engineer, and containing sufficient technical information to allow further detailed design of software, hardware and networks to proceed. J Borah [9] concluded that a conceptual model is not a set thing; it “should be malleable and adopt a coherent form appropriate for each development phase. An unstructured informal model is sufficient for requirements identification. A formal, structured and elaborate one is necessary for software developers.The notion that a conceptual model is a living construction essential for bridging the gap between user requirements definition and system technical design was taken further by Price, Coombs and John [10] in their analysis of the verification and validation needed for a synthetic environment (SE) created as an aid for defence decision making. They concluded that the conceptual model dictates what is being built and why; and that since it is the conceptual model which is validated against the purpose, the final developed SE is the implemented conceptual model. Though the intellectual debate concerning conceptual models will continue, it is clear from the practical point of view such a model is of great use. It is necessary to translate military user requirements into system design characteristics, into technical specifications, and to ensure that the resulting simulation system is fitted for its training purpose. Thus, if existing Military Principles can assist in formulating standard design characteristics for simulation/training systems, they probably would be part of a conceptual model, but would most definitely be valuable.4.   Fighting Power, Training & Doctrine Any Army exists to produce fighting power when needed.  Fighting power has 3 components: a physical component (manpower, logistics and equipment), a moral component (motivation and leadership), and a conceptual component. This last component outlines the method of fighting, its main element is doctrine.Military doctrine is a formal expression of military knowledge and thought that the Army accepts as being relevant at a given time. It covers the nature of current and future conflicts, the preparation of the Army for such conflicts and the methods of engaging in them to achieve success. Doctrine establishes a framework of understanding of an Army’s approach to warfare in order to provide the foundation for its practical application, and the training for such application. Fundamental to British Military Doctrine are the Principles of War. These Principles, developed over 4 centuries of war fighting, are broad precepts which influence the conduct of operations, and training for it.Training is, and will remain, fundamental to the three inter-related components of Fighting Power. It alone is the means by which the components and their elements are fused together to produce fighting power. Manpower needs to be trained to use equipment, commanders have to be schooled and practiced in the arts and sciences of leadership, and the whole army has to be trained to fight together so that they become certain that their doctrine and structure will lead to success.It is the function of training to develop military qualities, and to teach, by theory and practice, the methods of utilising numbers and scientific weapons to the best advantage. Without proper training, numbers, even when organised, tend to produce confusion and consequent disaster, and scientific weapons in untrained hands cannot develop their full power and may become a danger to the force which employs them.         ‘British Army Training Regulations 1909.’Properly conducted, training serves as a powerful reminder of the realities of soldiering, and develops the true potential of individuals, units and formations. It is the means whereby an army practices the application of its doctrine. Training has an important place in the Force Development Process – it can shape the doctrine from whence it came. In the British Army training is conducted in line with the Principles of Training. EMBED MSPhotoEd.3   5.   The Principles of War The Principles of War are listed below. An initial deduction relevant to the design of a simulation system used to support training for war follows each principle. With the exception of the master principle, which is placed first, undue emphasis should not be accorded to the order in which the others appear. [11].5.1 Selection and Maintenance of the Aim. In the conduct of war, it is essential to select and define the aims clearly. The ultimate aim may be absolute, the overthrow of a hostile government, or more limited, the recovery of occupied territory. Within his strategic directive, a commander may have several courses of action open, each of which would fulfill the aim. The selection of the best course will lead to the mission and outline plan being issued; the mission being a statement of the aim and its purpose. The aim passed on to subordinate commanders must be precise, expressed in unambiguous language, and attainable with the forces available. Once decided the aim must be circulated as widely as security allows so that all can direct their efforts to achieve the aim.Deduction: the simulation system must be capable of tracking, recording and reproducing the stated mission and tasks, from higher commander through the commander to his subordinate. In this way adherence to the principle can be rewarded during after action review (AAR). 5.2 Maintenance of Morale. Because success in war depends as much on moral as physical factors, morale is probably the single most important element of war. High morale fosters the offensive spirit and the will to win. It will inspire an army from the highest to the lowest ranks. Although primarily a moral aspect it is sensitive to material conditions and a commander should look after the well- being of his men.Deduction: whenever friendly computer generated forces (CGF) are incorporated in a system their behaviour must react positively to being well treated. Conversely their performance must be degraded if they are for example suffering from sleep loss, hunger, lack of shelter, poor medical support, or if their unit is taking heavy casualties.5.3  Offensive Action and Surprise. Offensive action is the chief means open to a commander to influence the outcome of a campaign or a battle. It confers the initiative on the attacker, giving him the freedom of action necessary to secure a decision. A successful defence must be followed by offensive action if it is to achieve a decisive result. Offensive action embodies a state of mind, which breeds the determination to gain and hold the initiative: it is essential for the creation of confidence. The potency of surprise as a psychological weapon at all levels should not be underestimated. It causes confusion and paralysis in the enemy's chain of command and destroys the cohesion and morale of his troops. One way to achieve surprise is by a rapid concentration of force, success will normally result from a concentration of superior force at the decisive time and place. This does not preclude dispersion, which may be valuable for the purposes of deception and avoiding discovery and attack. Deduction: The system needs to foster the will to win and offensive action. This could be by adaptation of the CGF responses, or by an embedded intelligent tutor prompting commanders to look at gaining the initiative. There is probably no need to change CGF behaviour to react to ‘surprise’ since they will already have awareness and have been allocated principal arcs of fire. Further change may put too much bias on surprise – the plan has to work! The key system aspect here is that the simulation must produce unpredictability and hence surprise those undergoing training. The experience of being so surprised will be an education.5.4  Economy of Effort. The corollary of concentration of force is economy of effort. It is impossible to be strong everywhere and if decisive strength is to be concentrated at the critical time and place there must be no wasteful expenditure of effort where it cannot significantly affect the issue. In order to gain a substantial advantage a commander will have to take a calculated risk in a less vital area. The application of the principle may be summed up as planning for a balanced deployment combined with a prudent allocation of resources strictly related to the aim.Deduction:  The system needs to be able to track resource usage – this may be battalions in a constructive simulation or tank shells in virtual reality trainer – so that usage can be compared against the given aim during AAR. The system needs to be variable in real time by the exercise controller so that adverse conditions of conflict can be prolonged – one of the best ways to learn economy of effort is to be forced to conserve it.5.5  Flexibility & Cooperation. Although the aim may not alter, a commander will be required to exercise judgement and flexibility in modifying his plans to meet changed circumstances, taking advantage of fleeting chances or shifting a point of emphasis. Flexibility depends upon the mental component of openness of mind on the one hand, and simple plans that can easily be modified on the other. A balanced reserve is a prerequisite for tactical or operational flexibility. Co-operation is based on team spirit and training, and entails the co-ordination of the activities of all Arms, of the Services and of Allies, for the optimum combined effort. Deduction:  Flexibility to achieve the mission is a key aspect of manoeuvrist doctrine and mission command. If a controller can inject unpredictability into a simulation exercise it will exercise flexibility. If the system can once again track resources used against mission assigned, and record where and when reserves were launched, then the AAR will be relevant. Combined arms and joint scenarios should be in the majority of those held by the simulation system, and there should be a wide choice (type, Nation, size) of flanking CGF available. Coordination to achieve cooperation and vice versa will then be exercised.5.6  Security. A degree of security by physical protection and information denial is essential to all military operations. Security should enable friendly forces to achieve their objectives despite the enemy's interference. Active measures include the defence of bases and entry points, a favourable air situation, flank protection and maintenance of adequate reserves. Deduction:  Information denial will be difficult to assess because of the need for transparency in order to formulate a relevant AAR. The system should be capable of providing prompts to consider security if such prompts are necessary. This could be done by intelligent tutoring during the planning phase or by rear area operations by opposing forces during execution.5.7 Administration. Sound administration is a prerequisite for the success of any operation. Logistic considerations are often the deciding factor in assessing the feasibility of an operation. A clear appreciation of logistic constraints is as important to a commander as his ability to make a sound estimate of the operational situation. No tactical plan can succeed without administrative support commensurate with the aim of the operation: it follows that a commander must have a degree of control over the administrative plan proportionate to the degree of his responsibility for the operation. Deduction: Any training simulation system must acknowledge combat supplies usage and casualties. The inability to ‘play’ logistics in early simulations was much criticised. The degree of administrative details provided and tracked by the system must be the same as the operational detail.  6.  The Principles of TrainingThe 8 Principles of Training [12] follow, again with an initial deduction relevant to the design of a simulation system used to support training for war. 6.1  Training is a Function of Command. The first principle of training is that it is a function of command. In peacetime, a commander directs, trains and prepares his command. The training of subordinates is a key responsibility of all commanders, and a core function that if neglected will undermine the operational effectiveness and fighting power of the Army. Though responsibility for the detail of training can be delegated, the overall responsibility for the state of training of individuals, sub-units, units and formations rests always with the commander. It is, therefore, important that commanders become involved in, and place their authority on, training.Deduction: The system needs to encourage commanders to become involved. User interfaces, for trainee, trainer and controller, need to be easy to use and inviting to commanders. Systems should contain exercise planning and AAR procedures that mandate a commander’s input. 6.2  Training must have Continuity & Progression.  Continuity is about maintaining an effective learning environment throughout a soldier’s career. Without continuity problems are likely to arise as soldiers move between teams and units. Progression is the process of a individual/team/unit moving forwards through training objectives that are increasingly challenging. Progression will lead to higher levels of achievement, building on prior attainment, but it is not necessarily a linear process. Progression will only be observed through continuous and effective assessment and recording - hence Continuity provides the framework for Progression. Training should develop logically from individual training, through team training to collective training and command & staff training. In each category there will be initial training, refresher training to renew skills, and continuation training to develop those skills further. Training should never end; its value begins to fade soon after the end of the training unless the skills are in regular use or practice.Deduction:  Effective assessment and recording of performance is the key to enabling continuity and progression. The system must firstly incorporate an automated objectives-based AAR tool, secondly maintain a record of the AAR packages within the system (as well as producing a take home package), and thirdly automatically request input from the last relevant package during the commander’s planning for a subsequent training exercise.  In addition the simulation system must offer a comprehensive range of training opportunities so that a wide range of competencies and types can be catered for.6.3  Training must be Relevant & Realistic.     Training must be relevant to both operational doctrine and to the needs of the individual/team/unit. Training must be realistic so that it is credible to current operations and so that it is interesting. If the needs of the training audience are addressed then continuity and progression are enabled. The audience’s needs may vary in training type as well as difficulty. Collective training, for example, has a role to play in developing character and leadership qualities and the cohesion of a group, even though it might appear to have no direct relationship to their employment. Training must be as realistic as safety requirements permit. The more realistic the training, the better the preparation for the job or role, and the more successfully the individual or unit is likely to perform. Through training units and their commanders gain experience in the application of the Army’s warfighting doctrine and tactics. To gain that experience, and for it to be realistic, training must be relevant to, and conducted in accordance with, doctrine.Deduction: The simulation system must again offer a comprehensive set of training events so that relevance to a wide range of audiences can be provided. A simulation system must have sufficient fidelity to achieve credibility and hence realism. The level of resolution required to achieve a credible reality will depend on the training audience – Generation X soldiers will be more demanding than veteran commanders.6.4  Training must be Challenging.   Individuals and groups will usually rise to a challenge, and the element of challenge will keep them interested in the training. Bored soldiers don’t learn. Each successive element in the progression of training should be more challenging, but sensibly so, than that which went before. Objectives must be attainable. Training should be a positive activity, designed to increase skills and confidence, not undermine it.Deduction: The key deduction, again, is that the simulation system must offer a range of difficulties for each training event type so that challenge and interest can be maintained. The system must be modern enough to interest and satisfy a young computer literate training audience – this relates as much to the need to reduce acquisition times, as it does to realism and resolution.6.5  Training should be Permissive of Errors.  Within any training environment it is important to create an atmosphere which is conducive to learning and improvement, and which is permissive of acceptable error so that individuals or groups are not fearful of the consequences of mistakes in any particular activity. Error in a controlled training environment can be a powerful experience for learning. Training should allow people to learn from the experience of their mistakes. Errors generally stand out more than successes and are therefore more easily used as teaching vehicles. The environment should therefore allow and recognize errors. As a corollary to this, errors in training should be corrected at an appropriate point in the training, and the training should be sufficiently flexible to allow for this. In correcting errors of judgment heavy-handedness should be avoided, as it tends to dampen future initiative. Training is not a selection process. It should be clear, however, that not all errors (such as those which breach the law or safety regulations) are permissible. Nor are repeated mistakes acceptable.Deduction:  All errors, procedural or doctrinal or factual or in identification, must be capable of being captured by the system. The response a simulation makes to a trainee error should be variable: a novice helicopter pilot in a full mission simulator should be permitted to fly through the odd tree top without catastrophic effects, but the error must be available for AAR.6.6  Training must have Aims and Objectives. It must be clear to all participants why the training is taking place, and what is to be achieved. Training is essentially the learning of a particular skill, usually involving practicing that skill. In order to measure training effectiveness we need to carefully state the performance and skill level required and under what conditions it is to be met – setting aims and objectives does this. Thus aim & objective setting is a key part of the learning process. There should be training objectives set for each level participating in training. Deduction:  The system should not allow training to commence until the commander’s aims and objectives have been set, and have been promulgated.6.7  Training should be Integrated. Training should not be conducted in isolation. It should be integrated into and governed by an organisation’s role and tasks, the circumstances in which it is likely to operate, the tasks it has to be prepared to undertake, and the way in which it wishes to conduct its affairs. Differing levels of training should whenever possible be integrated into the same training event. This kind of multi-echeloned (i.e. more than one training audience) training is necessary firstly because of the universal implications of digitization, and secondly in order to complete the required amount of individual/team/unit training in the shorter amount of available time.Deduction:  Any one training system must be able to be integrated within a system of systems. Macro level plug n play should be enabled. This has further implications for system communication protocols and for the open nature of any software used6.8  Training must be Continuously Reviewed.  A military adage is that if you train for the last war you will lose the next. If training and doctrine isn’t moving forward then it is moving backwards because the rest of the world is not standing still. A key aspect of both the systems approach to training design and the conduct of training itself is evaluation. There must be a regular evaluation of both the medium used for the training and the training itself. Assessment of the training should be against pre-determined standards, and the results fed back to the trainee. The resultant observations should contribute to the identification of lessons to learned. The individual, the team, the unit, the training system,  Army doctrine, and fighting power all benefit.Deduction:  The first and well known deduction is that AAR is vital to training. A second is that the system developer must specify standards of performance to be met by the system: throughput of trainees, utilization of server time, downtime of electronic equipment etc etc. System performance data must be passed unedited to the relevant commander’s staff so that a review can take place.7.   Abstraction of Design CharacteristicsA review and analysis of the deductions made does produce design characteristics. 7.1 After Action Review.  It is fundamental that every simulation system used to support training must have, by design, an integrated and embedded AAR facility.  AAR packages should be both available to take home, and  to be reproduced subsequently by the system.7.2 Recording and Analysis.  Systems must be able to record, at the request of an exercise controller, the following:Given and subordinated mission and tasksAllocation and use of reserve forcesAll logistic resources consumedCasualty progressionTrainee errorsSystem performance data.7.3 Commander’s Input.  Systems should be designed so that no training exercise can proceed without the appropriate commander setting aims and objectives – having first reviewed the last relevant AAR package.7.4 Computer Generated Forces.  All CGF should be designed so that their performance is degraded or improved in accordance with Maslow’s [12] hierarchy of human needs. There should be a wide range of friendly CGF available. Opposing CGF should be capable of rear area operations.7.5 Training Materiel Matrix.  A comprehensive matrix of training materiel should be designed for use in the system. The materiel should cover a wide range of events, scenarios, training types, and performance difficulty levels. The design of the system must allow the exercise controller to vary the difficulty of an exercise whilst it is being conducted.7.6  Intelligent Tutoring.  The system must be designed so that intelligent tutoring, from an embedded artificial agent or from a human subject matter expert, can be made available to the trainee to prompt him/her to follow a doctrinally correct path.7.7  Fidelity and Resolution.  The system design for fidelity must be high enough to achieve credibility and hence realism. The fidelity level must be variable so as to permit errors when deemed necessary by the exercise controller. The level of resolution required is that necessary to maintain the trainee’s interest throughout a training event. 7.8  System Architecture.  The design of the system must be to standards that allow seamless integration with other training systems.There is little strikingly new in these characteristics, but there are two key points. Firstly, that they are standard for all types of training systems; and secondly, that they have the benefit of a doctrinal audit trail.8.   ConclusionsThe need for simulation to support Military Training is greater than ever before. But, because of increasing costs and increasing uncertainty, so are the needs to get the simulation systems fielded in good time and make sure that they are fitted for purpose. The development of a simulation system to support training is a complex process. One of the steps in the process is conceptual analysis, an output from which is a conceptual model. This step is necessary to translate military user requirements into system design characteristics, into technical specifications, and ensure that the resulting simulation system is fitted for its training purpose.A set of standard design characteristics for training systems would be valuable. They would provide readily accessible guidance to the simulation developer, and would not be subject to change due to the whim of an individual military project director.Stating and explaining principles in open papers such as this aids effective communication from the military to the manufacturer. Deductions can be made from Military Principles about necessary design characteristics for simulation systems.Design deductions made in this manner are valuable because they are standard for all types of training systems, and have the benefit of a doctrinal audit trail.The scope of the principles considered could be usefully expanded to include:The principles of manouevre warfareThe principles of Counter Insurgency OperationsThe principles of Mission CommandIt is inconclusive whether the characteristics deduced in this paper are part of a conceptual model or not, and indeed whether they would be useful to a system designer or not. Further analysis is necessary.**********************9.   References[1]. National Simulation Centre Handbook for Training Simulations (The Blue Book)  Section 3.6 1998.  [2].
