Vision StatementA simulation conceptual model is an abstraction from either the existing or a notional physical world that serves as a frame of reference for further simulation development by documenting simulation-independent views of important entities and their key actions and interactions.  A simulation conceptual model describes what the simulation will represent, the assumptions limiting those representations, and other capabilities needed to satisfy the stakeholder’s requirements.  It bridges between these requirements, and simulation design. (From SCM SG TOR)    Topics to be addressed:Justification- Indication of the value added by a conceptual model (business case for CM)- Method to keep on track designer and developer- Identification of stakeholders- Impact of conceptual models upon stakeholders- Ability of conceptual model to address relevancy of real world components- Conceptual model only artifact to document relevancy of real world upon interactions where otherwise not recognizedMethodology- Advance the understanding of a conceptual model, their creation and use process, goal to increase stakeholder’s requirements in final solution.- Variety of formats (UML, animated powerpoint, word documents) needed communicate  between stakeholders- Archivable products, persistent for community- Common thread of components of well-formed conceptual models (tools, critical mass of end user content, strategy and manage reusable items, training)- Reuse of legacy simulators - Provision of a roadmap to reverse engineer conceptual model for legacy simulations- Future vision of utility of conceptual model- Reuse of systems/simulation engineering processes and products- Bottom-up or top-down development of conceptual models - Rationale for layering of conceptual modeling (national, commercial security interests)- Boundaries of conceptual model (conceptual, design, implementation)Relationships- Provide support for VV&A- Applicable to community broader than DoD audience (game developers)- Relationship to other SISO PDGs (BOM and VV&A Overlay)- Relationship to high level simulation development processesTerminologyModelModelingSimulationSimulation conceptual modelPurpose(s)RequirementsIdentifyAudiencesStakeholdersDomain spaceReferentRepresentationAbstractionCaptureDescribeAssumptionsLimitationsResolutionFidelityConsistencyComposabilityInteroperabilityPattern(s)LayeringValidation of conceptual modelWell-formed CMCredibilityLegacy simulation/simulatorEvolutionTaxonomy of conceptsStakeholder perspectivesRequirements artifact vs design artifactFormal vs informalTypes (formats capture and presentation) of CMs Range of conceptual model usesPurposes of CMsScope of CM, e.g. federation vs federate (stand alone or associated execution)Common frame of reference for CMFidelity resolution (level of detail / level of abstraction / decomposition of M&S domain space)Attributes or characteristics of a CMCommunication pathways internal and external (technical and management)Coherence (consistency) between CM viewsAssumption of composability for CMIndependence from implementation, application specificityRequirements definition and traceabilityMethodology of establishing credibilityConfiguration management of CM (timestamping)Evolutionary nature of CM (changing uses for CM over time)Support to ancillary documentation
