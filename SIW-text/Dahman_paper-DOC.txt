	Role of Distributed System Of System Testing in the Systems Development and Acquisition Process: The Joint Distributed Engineering Plant (JDEP) in the Context of Simulation-Based Acquisition (SBA)        September 2001Dr. Judith S. DahmannSenior Principal ScientistThe MITRE Corporation andScientific Advisor toDirector of InteroperabilityOSD/AT&LUS Department of DefenseAbstract:  Increasingly in the DOD, 'systems of systems' (SoS) approaches to operations are adding a layer of complexity to the already heavily burdened systems development and acquisition process, particularly when a new system is expected to interoperate with other evolving systems being managed independently of the new system.  In the DOD, the JDEP addresses this by fostering the capability for systems developers, testers, and war fighters, to access distributed hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) facilities and address SoS issues throughout the system life cycle.   This paper begins with a discussion of JDEP and the current implementation approach.  It then examines the JDEP construct from the perspective of the larger systems acquisition process.  Key areas are then identified which JDEP needs to consider if JDEP is to provide a useful tool to potential users who will be addressing system development and SoS interoperability with various tools throughout the life cycle.  Finally, these considerations are reviewed in the context of the classes of SBA enablers to assess the extent to which these enablers apply to JDEP as a tool for simulation-based acquisition. Keywords: JDEP, SAPD, Systems Acquisition, SBA, TestPurpose and IntroductionThe purpose of this paper is to discuss the role of system of system (SoS) integration, testing, and assessment in the system acquisition process, with a particular emphasis on the relationship between SoS testing and the increasing use of simulation to support effective acquisition.  Simulation-based acquisition (SBA) is a strategy to apply simulation capabilities throughout the acquisition process of a given program and sharing these capabilities smartly across different programs.  The SBA strategy has been articulated in government and industry, and is increasingly being adopted by key government programs.  In industry, perhaps the best known example is Boeing 777 development . At the same time, system interoperability has become a higher priority in the US DOD. The US war fighting doctrine increasingly calls for more effective joint and coalition operations (JV 2010 and 2020) requiring cooperative action by multiple systems.  Consequently, there is a growing need to ensure that the systems in the field today and the new systems in development are designed to work as part of a larger system of systems (SoS).   These SoS need to be integrated and tested routinely during development and especially prior to deployment, as well a each time  new systems are added to the larger SoS.  The Joint Distributed Engineering Plant (JDEP) is a funded initiative recently created to support this need.  JDEP provides access and technical support and  fosters the reuse of existing hardware and software in the loop (HW/SWIL) capabilities across the DOD and industry allowing the creation of distributed federations of systems to support use in the development, integration test and assess of SoS.This paper will examine the anticipated process of SoS testing using distributed HW/SWIL  capabilities in the context of the larger acquisition process, and the SBA strategy for increasing the effectiveness of this process, from the perspective of applications foster improved interoperability.  Emphasis on System InteroperabilityIn the US DOD, there is increasing emphasis on system interoperability.   In November 1999, the Office of the Secretary of Defense established a Director for Interoperability reporting to the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics).   The mission is to provide a focus, working with C3I, the Joint Staff, CINCs, Services, Defense Agencies, and Coalition Forces, to enable the full range of military operations, through interoperability and coalition warfare initiatives.  Two DoD instructions have been reissued which make explicit the consideration of interoperability at each stage of systems acquisition process.  In effect, they provide the mechanisms within the requirements and system acquisition process itself to ensure that as systems are conceived, developed, tested, and fielded, their ability to interoperate in a system of systems environment is addressed at each step along the way. CJCSI 3170.01A, “Requirements Generation System.”  This instruction requires all requirements documentation - regardless of acquisition category level – to conform with joint policy, technical architecture integrity, and interoperability standards. CJCSI 6212.01B, “Compatibility, Interoperability, Integration and C4 Supportability Certification of Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Weapon Systems.”  This instruction specifies three interoperability certifications to be accomplished for every C4I system and weapons system that interfaces with a C4I system.  Additionally, it provides the process and format for developing interoperability Key Performance Parameters and Information Exchange Requirements for system requirements documentation.  Consequently, interoperability is now a key performance parameter (KPP) for all systems and the support for interoperability with and among C4I systems is an integral part of systems planning and development.  Defining interoperability tailored for each system and assessing this effectively from requirements through test is now expected as part of the standard acquisition process.Joint Distributed Engineering Plant  (JDEP)To make systems-of-systems (SoS) interoperability a reality, new ways of conceiving, developing, integrating and testing systems will be needed.  The Joint Distributed Engineering Plant (JDEP) is a DOD enterprise level initiative to support developers, testers and war fighters in system of systems engineering, testing and operational assessments.  The JDEP will provide the means to link distributed SoS capabilities for integration and interoperability testing.  The initial focus of JDEP is on federating laboratory-based hardware and software in the loop (HW/SWIL) systems, recognizing the need for a growth path incorporating simulations and interface to live systems. Currently focused on Joint Theater Air Missile Defense (JTAMD), JDEP will evolve to provide a capability to support joint, system of systems applications across the DOD. JDEP History and Current StatusThe Joint Distributed Engineering Plant (JDEP) was initiated in June 1999 based on a memorandum from the Principal Deputy, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (DUSD/AT&L) and the Joint Staff J8. The memorandum established a General Officer/Flag Officer Executive Steering Group (ESG)  supported by a Joint Engineering Task Force (JETF).  These groups were charged with the creation of a JDEP to support joint integration and interoperability testing with direction to focus on JTAMD as an initial application for JDEP. The guidance to undertake JDEP was incorporated into the Defense Planning Guidance. OSD funding has been allocated for central components of JDEP development and JDEP capital investment. JITC has been funded to support operations, and funds were allocated to support the participation of their Service systems in JDEP.JDEP began implementation in FY01.  Congress authorized initiation of the JDEP program in September.  The Single Integrated Air Picture (SIAP systems engineer) has been designated the customer  of the initial JDEP event scheduled for September 2001.In FY01, JDEP is viewed as three tracks.  Track 1 is the JDEP TAMD initial event.  This is a limited build to establish the JDEP concept involving a four-system implementation; thus demonstrating the concept and providing useful results to SIAP system engineer.  Track 2 will expand implementation to address broader JTAMD issues. Based on lessons learned from track 1, track 2 will add systems and sites to support JTAMD integration and interoperability testing.  Finally, Track 3 is to extend JDEP beyond JTAMD to other mission areas.  JDEP StrategyWith this larger (track 3) mission in mind, the JDEP Executive Steering Group (ESG) adopted a JDEP strategy to implement JDEP as a capability which will go beyond the JTAMD mission area to other joint interoperability areas with the objective of supporting developers, testers as well as warfighters.   The strategy takes a broad view of the role and form of ‘JDEP’ in the larger issues of mission area planning, integration and interoperability testing and provided the basic guidance to allow for forward planning thus supporting out-year JDEP developments.  This strategy provided the basis for designing the JDEP management structure and implementation plans to be put into place in FY01. The JDEP strategy is based on a set of basic ideas:  JDEP capabilities, JDEP technical framework, JDEP users and providers, and JDEP events.JDEP will provide access to distributed capabilities, the collection of ‘piece parts’ that can be configured in different ways to meet the variable needs of different users in the conduct of HW and SW in the loop (HW/SWIL) integration and testing.    These include, among other things, systems, stimulators, data exchange specifications, test procedures, data collectors, and analysis plans. These capabilities are owned by different organizations and are located in a variety of geographic locations.  They also include simulations and scripts which may augment or act as surrogates for the HW/SWIL end items depending on the nature of the user needs, available resources and schedule constraints, and the scenarios needed to provide an operational context for SoS integration and test. These high value assets are costly, and once created, should be leveraged as much as possible to support existing needs. The JDEP technical framework is the definition of the components of a JDEP configuration, interfaces (specifications) for the way the components work together, and the guidance on how to configure and apply the components to a users needs. It is the general ‘blueprint’ for assembly of the ’piece parts’ to address a particular issue.  This framework needs to be developed considering the broader purposes of JDEP, applying existing standards and tools wherever possible. JDEP users are the developers, testers, and war fighters who have a need for a HW/SWIL loop environment to address their specific integration or test needs.  These users may be developing or upgrading a system which has interoperability requirements.  They may be testing an individual system or a system-of-systems (SoS) to see if these requirements have been met.  Or, they may be assessing the degree to which the systems meet the needs of the intended operational use.  Different users will come with different needs.  These users will bring these different issues to JDEP when they need a HW/SWIL environment.Users will be supported by JDEP providers in several ways.  Providers assist the users in identifying the capabilities they need from the JDEP inventory and supply the capabilities they own to meet the users needs.  They support users in the conduct of the event by configuring the capabilities to meet the needs of the user, planning the event, conducting event activities, collecting and analyzing the data to meet the user needs.  The user then applies the results of the event to their own problem that led them to conduct the event in the first place.JDEP events occur each time a set of JDEP components are configured (based on the JDEP technical framework) and used to meet a specific users needs.  These events which include the full process of planning, configuring and executing a federation, as well as the collection and analysis of data from the federation.  JDEP events are expected to be numerous routine activities that may be small (two or three system) configurations to address the specific needs of a developer, tester or war fighter, perhaps in conjunction (following or preceding) with larger events.  When events take place, how often, using which participating capabilities will all be driven by the nature and frequency of user needs.  JDEP Applications Throughout the System Development Life CycleWhile ideally, JDEP would be a component of mission area capabilities and management, there is currently only limited organizational structure in place to support these types of activities (e.g. TAMD).  In the meantime, there are growing needs for SoS environments to address existing interoperability policy requirements.  The JDEP extension strategy recognizes the longer-term vision and proposes to affect that by near -term capabilities to support near-term users, building capabilities and experienceFigure 1:  The 5000.1 Acquisition ProcessFigure 1 depicts the new acquisition process as defined in 5000.1. DoD regulations call for interoperability to be addressed at each milestone in this process.  In this process, JDEP can support new systems acquisitions once there is an end item available for HW/SWIL integration of testing. Prior to this point, interoperability will be addressed, but this will be done using prototypes, simulation, and analytic approaches.  This may occur as early as concept and technology development when there is an existing technology or product being considered as the basis for the new system (e.g. Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) or commercial product) or when the interfaces with other systems are critical and HW/SWIL representations need to be incorporated intoearly design assessments.  Beyond this, JDEP is also a potentially useful tool to support the reengineering and upgrades of existing systems, which are large in number, and are being considered for investment to meet current interoperability needs.  JDEP As One Tool in a Larger ToolsetWhile it is apparent that JDEP can be a very useful capability, it is important to recognize that it is part of a larger suite of tools used in the development, test and assessment of war fighter SoS capabilities.  HW/SWIL testing can be costly and manpower intensive, and hence should be reserved for use when other less costly approaches cannot support the need.  Simulations and analytic methods, as well as simulation-based exercises, can address a number of issues that may not require the HW/SWIL capability provided through JDEP.  Further, there may be some SoS issues for which HW/SWIL or simulation activities are not appropriate and require live systems for the assessment.  Use of Simulation To Address Interoperability Across Life CycleFigure 2 displays several ways to envision the application of simulation, HWIL and live system environments to address acquisition issues through the system life cycle. The first approach depicts a sequential use of simulation, with simulation applying during early concept development and technology exploration and into system development and demonstration, when physical hardware prototyping traditionally begins.  In time, prototypes (physical or virtual) are replaced by first production systems that are tested on ranges as ‘live systems.’ The SBA strategy suggests that to the extent possible hardware prototypes be minimized or even eliminated, which means that simulation would be the dominant tool until much later in the acquisition process. In any case, the results from simulation activities early in the process will provide guidance on the issues best addressed subsequently in a HW/SWIL and live environments.  In this light, there may be some aspects of a system that can be addressed in simulation throughout the process, and others that require physical prototyping.  This suggests that the second depiction of concurrent use of different environments to address different issues. To maintain consistency across the life cycle, the measures or assessment tools used in early purely simulation environments will be needed support development activities based on the use of HWIL and live systems testing. This description applies primarily to the use of simulation and HW/SWIL in the design and development of an individual system. However, as is shown in the third depiction, with the requirement to ensure system interoperability, the same types of supporting environments apply, but their use is more likely to be concurrent and mixed, as in the third depiction in the figure.  First, while JDEP has been fundamentally envisioned as a HW/SWIL SoS capability, it is important to recognize the integral role of simulation.  Even in a ‘pure’ HWIL application, simulation is used in the simulation/ stimulation and communications interfaces to the HWIL components.  The more there is a desire to immerse the HWIL into realistic operational environments, the more simulation will need to be employed. To address interoperability, these environments need to support representations not only of the system under development but also of the other systems that will be interoperating with the new system. The ‘other systems, both friendly and enemy, can be represented in simulations, allowing for use of these simulated representations in lieu of HWIL when appropriate.  Further, where virtual prototypes have been used to represent a new system, these may be introduced into a mixed environment of simulations and HW/SWIL representations to address systems of systems interoperability issues early in the development process.Finally, live systems interoperability tests are logically the final step in development, but increasingly due to range limitations and other difficulties with field robust suits of systems, simulations are used to augment live range activities, along with lab based HW/SWIL systems representations.  Implications for JDEP This discussion results in a view of a set of overlapping ‘environments’ with suite of system representations in simulations, lab-based HW/SWIL and live systems, which may be used in different combinations to support different interoperability issues for sets of systems at different stages of the acquisition process.  In essence, this suggests that JDEP as a HW/SWIL capability is just one component of this larger set of interconnected acquisition support tools used to support system interoperability issues throughout the life cycle and across systems.  What does this mean for the technical and operational aspects of federated HW/SWIL systems under the JDEP strategy? Common interoperability standards One of the major uses of these aqcuisition support environments is to assess the information exchanges among the SoS participants.  These exchanges are implemented using a variety of standard message formats and operation exchange protocols (e.g. Link16, VMF, etc.).  Naturally, these standard exchange formats will be implemented in JDEP HW/SWIL federations as well as simulation or live systems.  The supporting infrastructure components will also need interoperability standards to support data exchange.  If purely simulation environments used early in the life cycle are to be used throughout the life cycle, augmented with HW/SWIL components or live systems, then it is important for the three ‘environments’ to be supported by a common interoperability standards.  This means that the ‘JDEP Technical Framework’, discussed earlier in this paper, needs to be designed with the broader set of simulation and live components in mind, not just the HW/SWIL federates.  This suggests that architectures like the Test and Training Range Architecture (TENA),designed for interfacing simulation, HW/SWIL and live ranges should be given serious consideration as the basis for the JDEP technical framework.  Since TENA is built upon the High Level Architecture (HLA) and supports interfaces to legacy DIS protocols, range specific protocols, and tactical data links, it seems well suited to JDEP needs.  Since it is based on open industry standards for simulation (HLA as OMG Distributed System Facility 1.0 and IEEE 1516), it would facilitate incorporation of elements from industry and international partners and the use of commercial products.  Finally, it is recognized that adopting a common framework may not mean that this framework will be applicable immediately to fully structure JDEP events.  It would mean however, the JDEP has the opportunity to become an influential player in the evolution of frameworks such as TENA, and could benefit from broader community experience in the transition to the use of standards.   The HLA community has a growing experience base in the configuration and management of hybrid federations, which offer lessons learned to JDEP.Data exchange standardsSimilarly, if new HW/SWIL elements are to be incorporated into heretofore purely simulation environments the data exchanges among federates (in HLA and TENA terminology: the Federation Object Model or FOM) for a particular domain or mission area or slice, would logically be common across federations with different federate types.  Hence, when designing the data exchange specifications for a JDEP federation for a particular area, compatibility with those of other federations, particularly simulation federations, supporting that area should be given priority.  For example, a logical candidate user for JDEP is the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program.  JSF has used simulation extensively in the initial stages of development and is currently implementing version 8 of the HLA-based Virtual Strike Warfare environment (VSWE8).  Logically, the data interchange standards for a HW/SWIL federation supporting JSF, which would include simulation federates along selected HW/SWIL federates, would be built on the VSWE federation object model. Even when beginning with a HW/SWIL environment, commonality in both interoperability standards and data exchanges benefits the ‘JDEP’ user.  Most JDEP HW/SWIL federations will require some simulation support.  To the degree that existing simulations can be used in their ‘native’ state to support these federations, the cost of configuring and executing a JDEP federation will be reduced.Multiple ‘interchangeable’ representations of systemsOne of the issues that JDEP is expected to face is the competition for access to HW/SWIL facilities in demand by both the Services developing and fielding the Service systems and by joint users which need the system as a component in a SoS environment.  One option is the use of purely digital representations of systems where the HW/SWIL is not specifically needed for the SoS federation requirements. The degree of detail in the simulation representation of the system needed would be determined by the role the system played in the SoS federation given its purpose.   This would mean that users would have a choice among different types of system representations when creating s federation for SoS applications.  The JDEP concept of operations calls for a JDEP Coordinator who will support users in identifying the needed components of their federation and supporting them in configuring the federation to meet their needs.  This would imply that the JDEP coordinator would ultimately want to have knowledge of not only the HW/SWIL representations of systems, but the simulation representations as well.   This further suggests the possibility of use of common representations of common elements across a federation.  For instance HW/SWIL federations are typically configured from HWIL facilities outfitted with an interface which both support data exchange with other federates and augments the HWIL with simulated representation of the elements of the system not incorporated into the HWIL, such as sensors or communications.  Today, it is common to simply reuse these so-called ‘simulation-stimulation’ front-ends for the set of systems in a federation.  Because the characteristics of the simulated elements across the multiple federates may vary in significant ways, this may cause unwanted distortions in the results of a federation event.  In time it may possible to separate out these simulated representations embedded in the ‘front-ends’ as federates with a consistent level of representation across a federation.  Likewise it may be possible to incorporate federates which provide common representation of aspects of federation activity such as environment, communications, or even weapons effects.Shared supporting toolsFor many of the same reasons, it seems logical to have a set of tools which could be used in a federation independent of the make up of the federates, especially since some federations will be used repeatedly, with different components being represented with federates of different types.  This has further advantages in terms of familiarity for users who will be implementing federations of different complexions throughout the life cycle.Common process for design, configuration and execution of federationsThis view has the further implication for the way users approach the application of these acquisition support environments.  Logically, a user will begin with an SoS interoperability issue to be addressed, and will be seeking to configure an environment to address this issue.  This federation might include HW/SWIL, simulations or live systems depending on the nature of the problem, and at the outset the user may not have determined which of the systems needs to be represented in what form to most cost effectively meet the needs.  If this is the case, it is important that the process followed in formulating the user need, selecting the federation components and configuring these, be common across the types of federates which may be incorporated.  A user does not need to be burdened with using a fundamentally different process depending on the type of tools selected to address the problem, or different processes at different stages of the acquisition process, when the underlying activities are basically common across the tools. The Federation Development and Execution Process (FEDEP) now under consideration for standardization as a Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization (SISO) product is one candidate for this process as is the draft ISO 15288 standard system development process.Consistent verification, validation and accreditation (VV&A) processAn important part of creating any environment for system integration and testing is to ensure that the components of that environment are appropriate for the purpose for the environment.  When creating a federation to support SoS integration, it is important to ensure that the components, including the test drivers and simulation-stimulation components, are appropriate to the purpose of the federation.  This include both ascertaining the degree to which the components individually are reflective of their system analogs, and whether together the federation as configured reflects the SoS environment appropriately for the problem to be addressed.  This process is needed whatever the mix of the types of the federates.  There is DoD policy on VV&A and Service implementation guidance and an evolving body of experience on how to effectively implement V&V which could usefully be applied to support JDEP event accreditation decisions.  To the degree JDEP practices reflect community approaches, the easier it will be to incorporate new elements into the JDEP inventory which are sufficiently understood as to their capabilities and limitations.Common security certification processA similar argument can be made for common security practices.  The DISA standard DITSCAP process applied to the security certification of distributed systems, the nature of the distributed elements notwithstanding.  It has been applied to simulation federations and could productively be applied to JDEP federations as well.  This again has the advantage that users with experience with simulation federations can build on that experience when dealing with federations using HW/SWIL, and won’t have to adopt a new security process because the nature of the elements of the acquisition support environment are changing.User metricsWithin particular areas of common interest there will be sets of metrics developed which will persist throughout the life cycle, particularly metrics which addressing key SoS characteristics.  JDEP needs to be flexible to support the metrics of importance to user communities, particularly these metrics may have already been developed before a user needs to create HW/SWIL federations.  In the JDEP event 1, the Single Integrated Air Picture (SIAP) Systems Engineer has developed a suite of metrics which are planned to be used in both simulation-based assessments and in evaluating data from live events (JSCIET).  JDEP event 1 will implement these same metrics, so that the JDEP results can be used as a component of the broader based SIAP assessment process.Reusable, persistent federationsFinally, to address SOS issues for an area of interest or family of systems, it seems logical and cost effective that a persistent federation would be developed and reused.  This federation could be used to address interoperability issues for the SoS as a whole as well as for the different component systems as they proceed through the life cycle.  This federation would be designed so it could can incorporate federates of different types to represent systems, and could be subsetted for different purposes, limiting the federation implemented for a specific event to the elements needed to address the specific purpose of the event.  This would provide a consistent environment reflecting the state of the family of systems.SBA Enablers As A Review FrameworkAs the discussion in the preceding section indicates, JDEP HW/SWIL capabilities, when viewed in the context of the other tools used to support advanced acquisition environments, comprise an integral part of the infrastructure to support SoS engineering.  To the degree that JDEP itself is a ‘simulation’ of operational systems, and uses simulation as components of federations, it is an element of a larger SBA strategy.  In the current SBA thinking, a suite of enablers has been identified.  This paper concludes with a review of the major enabler classes and a discussion of the status of these as they apply to JDEP.SBA EnablersAs part of the evolution of the SBA strategy, it has become clear that the goals of SBA are consistent with a number of other initiatives in the US and internationally.  While SBA concepts focus on the use of simulation, SBA recognizes that simulation is one part of a complex array of activities.  These are part of the process of transforming acquisition and leveraging advanced information technologies to create acquisition environments to support the acquisition process generally, and acquisition of complex interoperable systems.  In a effort to place SBA concepts into a broader context, and to examine options to join forces with activities with common goals, a review and synthesis of the underlying concepts embraced by the Simulation Based Acquisition (SBA) strategy was conducted.  The resulting classes of enablers provide a useful framework for discussion of the diverse efforts underway which together to address common higher level goals.  Toward that end, these classes of enables are reviewed here from a JDEP perspective, to summarize the state of JDEP development and its relationship to the larger efforts underway to create advanced acquisition environments to support system acquisition and SoS engineering.JDEP in Context of Enabler ClassesBased on the discussion in this paper, it has been argued that the capabilities provided by JDEP are a component of the larger set of ongoing activities to create needed infrastructure to support the increasingly demanding development, integration and test of systems of systems.  As such, the paper argues, JDEP needs to be technically conceived as part of that larger infrastructure ‘suite’ with the objective of support the users with as integrated a capability as possible.  In this final section of the paper, the enabler classes will be used to discuss the status and actions for JDEP to achieve this objective.Policy, law and organizational changes  As is discussed early in this paper, the acquisition process has increasing incorporated the requirements for system interoperability into the standards system development process.  JDEP is expected to provide a vehicle for a program manager to more cost effectively address these requirements by enabling access to resources representing companion systems owned by others.  The more JDEP works in concert with the other tools available to support these issues, the more likely JDEP is to contribute and the higher the likelihood that consistent cost effective approaches to system of systems engineering will evolve, leading to more mission effective systems for the war fighter.  There are however still some critical missing pieces.  Right now systems acquisition is on a system by system basis, and there is considerable uncertainty in how the families of systems are expected to work together.  Considerable work remains in the development of defining architectures that can act as viable blueprints for shaping systems development and evolution.  In addition, until there are ways to organize and manage systems in terms of the set of needed mission capabilities, there will be substantial difficulty in defining and supporting system-of-systems interoperability.  This will likely require changes in the way the DOD defines requirements, acquires systems and manages their integration and deployment.  As the JDEP Strategy assessment concluded, JDEP can offer important benefits in the meantime for individual system development, but the real benefit of a JDEP and the other components of an end-to-end acquisition environment infrastructure will be seen when there is supporting organization for SoS development and deployment.Process changes The process changes needed to effectively utilize these types of environments follow the discussion in the preceding section.  With a reorientation towards systems of systems, changes are needed in the way systems are conceived designed, developed and integrated, with an eye towards maximizing the effectiveness of the SoS rather than the component parts.  This requires cultural changes on the part of the system development team, as well as changes in the way that systems are funded and managed.Standards for data interchange The need for common data exchange specifications among different environments is discussed explicit above as an important element in making the JDEP capabilities readily usable across the acquisition process.Standards for M&S software application interoperability Similarly, the need to adopt standards for interoperability among federates which are shared with simulations and live systems is highlighted as key to JDEP overall effectiveness for the users.Authoritative information sources Authoritative data sources has not been discussed explicitly but this is inherently needed to identify the right set of components for any federation, for configuring and operating these components, including JDEP federations.  This is key to the accreditation of federations, and essential for the value of these federation to support the users.Capable, reusable models and simulations JDEP is based on the understanding that different organizations are developing representations of their systems as a by-product of the system development process.  By more formally identifying and reusing these to support the SoS development, integration and test process, we can cost-effectively begin to address SoS issues throughout the acquisition process as now required by policy.  As JDEP matures, areas where these capabilities are not available, are nor adequate or are ‘over-booked’ will be identified as places where investment will be required.Means to manage collaboration & multi-domain optimization Operating and using JDEP capabilities will be an inherently collaborative process.  The JDEP management and operational approach is based on a collaborative engineering team concept with active participation by the Services and Joint organizations.  This in itself mirrors the challenge of mission oriented SoS operations.  The processes and needed supporting tools will evolve as the activity matures.  The current view is that this will leverage the technology in the commercial world, which is struggling with the same issues in collaborative business enterprises, both within conglomerates and across teaming arrangements.Means to identify, protect & obtain reusable resources A key element in the JDEP strategy is the role for the JDEP coordinator who serves the broad range of users in the location, access and configuration of the capabilities needed to address the user problem.  This critical coordinator role was designed in recognition of the fact that reuse is often severely hampered by the inability to find, assess, and access available capabilities.  One of the results of the assessment in this paper is that this coordination need to go beyond HW/SWIL capabilities and address supporting simulation and live resources as well.  This may require added relationships, but is likely to bring larger benefit.Business case evidence As JDEP takes form it will be important to assess the value for cost provided by this approach.  At this point the only other option to create environments for SoS integration and test is for each user to develop the tools and environments on their own.  The view is that this would logically lead to duplication of efforts, limited leave behind, and inconsistency in the characteristics of the environments used by different systems to address interoperability for systems that will need to work together in the same operational environment.  Already, feedback to the JDEP strategy has urged application of the JDEP tools earlier in the life cycle where changes in systems can more cost-effectively made as the result of the lessons learned from JDEP events.   Similarly, JDEP has adopted an added emphasis on the use simulation as a lower cost approach to address certain issues.10. Education, motivation & evolution of work force Finally, while there has been considerable value derived from the use of advanced acquisition environments in some specific Services acquisitions, there is a serious need to share these results with the broader community. This is critical if the value added of these techniques is to be realized at a sufficiently broad scale to have a material effect of the acquisition process as a whole.  Further, a critical mass of applications is needed for the benefits of shared assets to be realized, both for interoperability of SoS and for individual systems.  There needs to be more sharing among the communities who are building an experience base.  In particular there need to be much more exchange among those with actual experience with simulation federations for acquisition, with those experienced in federating range assets for testing and finally, with the JDEP community with their focus on federated HW/SWIL systems.  Not only can these communities learn from each other, but overtime they will need to work more closely as the federation environments needed by users cut across these federation types to create mixed applications which will constitute the nature of future acquisition support environments.  Finally, there will need to be incentives and clear rewards to motivate organizations to change their behaviors and operate in ways that reflect a broader enterprise view.SummaryThis paper has examined plans for investments in DOD enterprise support for HW/SWIL federations to support the systems engineering of interoperable SoS in the context of the larger acquisition process and other tools evolving to address similar needs.  The paper argues that these environments need to be considered as components of a larger, heterogeneous set of supporting capabilities that, when supported with common standards and processes, can more effectively support the acquisition community as it evolves toward emphasis of more complex SoS system developments.ReferencesChairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3170.01A.

In this capacity, Dr. Dahmann provides technical review, assessment and recommendations on interoperability plans, issues and initiatives, including the application of emerging commercial technologies throughout the system acquisition cycle, approaches to interoperability measurement and assessment, and opportunities for coalition partnerships to collaboratively develop common technical approaches to interoperability.  She was the lead on the project to develop the JDEP extension strategy discussed in this paper. Prior to this, Dr. Dahmann was the Chief Scientist for the Defense Modeling and Simulation Office for the US Director of Defense Research and Engineering, a position she held from 1995 to April 2000.  In her role as Chief Scientist, Dr. Dahmann led the development of the High Level Architecture, a general-purpose software architecture for the development and interoperation of simulations, now an IEEE Standard (IEEE 1516).
