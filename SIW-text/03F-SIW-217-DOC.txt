PDG Discussion NotesJMC, 9/21/03This document briefly summarizes the discussions at the SISO SIW C4ISR/Simulation Interoperability Technical Reference Model II Study Group (C4I TRM II SG) meeting in Orlando on September 18th.  The virtual outbrief, soon to appear on the SISO website, contains additional information.  The SG was chaired by Dr. Andreas Tolk, VMASC, ODU.  TRM II is the third in a series of C4I/Sim related study groups that began in 1999.  An overview of their goals and findings was presented.  The TRM Sourcebook and User Guide are not at a point where they can be released as reference products.  Andreas noted the recent downturn in SG participation and suggested that the SG format had run its course.  He recommended the formation of a Product Development Group (PDG), and all those present agreed with this recommendation.   [A list of attendees is included with this summary.]Frank Carr nominated Jim Caylor to initiate and facilitate the PDG formation process.  Tom Mullins provided details on the process.  Jim was tasked with reviewing the SISO Policies & Procedures Manual and initiating a Reflector dialogue that will ultimately result in a formal Product Nomination (PN) to the SAC (the first step in the formation of a PDG).Points made during the meeting (all subject to further discussion) included:A single “guidance” document should be produced.  It will be called something like “Guidance for use of the C4ISR/Sim Interoperability Technical Reference Model”.  The focus of the document will be the TRM highlighted in 03F-SIW-124 & 125 (enhanced Carr/Hieb model).Other models/architectures/frameworks (and related initiatives and evolving technology) should not be totally ignored.  At a minimum, the guidance document should include references to these other activities (and commentary to place it in the context of the larger body of work).Attempting to satisfy all legacy, interim, and future interoperability needs is impossible.A guidance document is needed now, so hopefully a product can be published within a year or so.A PN should be submitted to the SAC no later than a month before the next SIW.Perhaps a working group can be arranged during I/ITSEC.The C4ISR and M&S communities add new people every day, so an introductory guidance document should benefit everyone.The Lexicon and Categorical Bibliography should also be updated.Wider participation by the C4ISR community in the process is needed.All user domains should be considered in the presentation of the material (e.g. training, research, procurement, and test).The document should be generic, in the sense that all the armed services and Joint-Interagency-Intergovernmental-Multinational interests should be represented.To ensure the document meets the needs of the various communities, each PDG member should actively solicit ongoing feedback from at least one “customer” (e.g. review of draft versions of the document).Others are interested in participating, but could not attend or had to return home due to the storm (John Daly, Don Timian, and Joe Lacetera were specifically mentioned).Attendees should review 03F-SIW-124 & 125 for background information.A meeting summary should be placed on the Reflector as soon as possible. Study Group Attendees (* indicates desire to actively participate in a PDG)*Andreas Tolk (Chair)	VMASC, ODU		 HYPERLINK "mailto:atolk@odu.edu" atolk@odu.edu			(757) 686-6203*Curtis Blais		NPS			 HYPERLINK "mailto:clblais@nps.navy.mil" clblais@nps.navy.mil		(831) 656-3215Craig D.
