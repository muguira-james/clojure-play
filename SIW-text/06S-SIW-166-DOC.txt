Name of Forum or Group:  Analysis (ANL) ForumChairCam TranVice ChairEmmet BeekerSecretaryJohn FayObjectives for this Workshop:Focus on exchange of ideas and lessons learned on interoperability, performance considerations, and uses of distributed M&S in support of existing and emerging mission areas.Familiarize audience (in particular, ANL Forum) with activities of SGs and PDGs.  Reciprocally, introduce user requirements to SGs and PDGs.Comments and Recommendations:Paper 042 relates to the HLA-Evolved PDG, and paper 131, the DEVS SGTwo MSDL-related papers (018 and 091) update the user community (and the ANL Forum) activities of the MSDL SG and now the MSDL PDG.  In addition, the three papers (018, 022, and 091) feature MATREX.New M&S supports of applications and analyses are sought for future workshops. Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)23Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)44Peak attendance (including joint sessions)68Total papers presented13“No-show” presentationsNoneOther presentations and panel discussions1Recommended Reading List nomination: 06S-SIW-01406S-SIW-04206S-SIW-017Paper 06S-SIW-014 presents in details a substantial effort to support multi-warfare analysis.  The effort federates EADSIM, NSS, and three JHU/APL-developed simulations, and aims to facilitate the examination of effects of one warfare area on another. Paper 06S-SIW-042 presents best practices enabled/achieved via HLA-Evolved Encoding Helpers.  Although encoding helpers add no new functionality, they provide opportunities for reducing integration time and risk.  Paper 06S-SIW-017 describes use of optimistic simulation and Kalman filtering techniques for realtime estimation and prediction.  While the use of Kalman filtering is well-known in estimation and prediction, implementation using optimistic simulation is novel.                   2006 SPRING SIW OUTBRIEF FORM
