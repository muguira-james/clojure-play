It is relatively well understood that as a System Engineering tool, synthetic environments have the potential of offering significantly accelerated system development, thus enabling the prompt insertion of technology and reaping the cost benefits of reduced lifecycle times and fewer mistakes (i.e. delivered system meets user requirements).However, as a result of work carried out by the UK Maritime Synthetic Environment Based Acquisition Team, which considered the development of synthetic environments in support of a Naval platform lifecycle, it has been highlighted that, in order to realise these benefits, requires the synthetic environment implementation process to be addressed. 	In the absence of formal process for the development of synthetic environments, the work explored the concepts of a Common Reference Model and the Model/Data Roadmap. These concepts provided limited localised consistency and coherence but highlighted implementation issues, with far-reaching applicability outside the maritime environment, in particular:	Formal methods/processes for the development of consistent and coherent synthetic environmentsMapping the relationships between a synthetic environment development process and a platform/system lifecycleManagement of processes and resources in the formulation and support of synthetic environments. This paper provides an overview of the work carried out by the UK Maritime Synthetic Environment Based Acquisition Team, with particular emphasis on their processes in support of the UK Smart Procurement Initiative, which are currently under development, and their use of an Electronic Process and Product Management tool. BackgroundFollowing the Strategic Defence Review (SDR) of 1998, which recommended a wholly new approach to the procurement and support of defence equipment, the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD) has initiated what has been termed ‘Smart Procurement’. This initiative embraces the ethos of System Engineering to provide an holistic approach to defence procurement and as such deliver military materiel faster, better and cheaper.Under the Smart Procurement Initiative (SPI), a number of significant organisational and procedural changes have been effected, such as the management of defence equipment according to capability and the adoption of Integrated Project Teams (responsible for the delivery of defence equipment and comprising both MOD and industry representatives).Synthetic environments (SEs) have subsequently been identified by the SPI as a key enabling technology for the exploitation of economies within the procurement cycle. Their application in this specific domain is currently co-ordinated by the MOD (SE Co-ordination Office) and has been termed Synthetic Environment Based Acquisition (SeBA), which may be considered akin to the US Simulation Based Acquisition initiative.The Problem DomainIt is well understood that, as a System Engineering tool, SEs could support a system throughout its complete lifecycle, with the potential of offering significantly accelerated system development. This, in turn, could enable the inclusion of leading edge technology and realise the cost benefits of reduced lifecycle times and fewer mistakes (i.e. the delivered system meets the user requirements). The potential benefits of SEs are summarised as follows:Reduced risk (through informed decision making)Reduced cycle time (i.e. gets inside the technology loop)Reduced live exercises/trials (permits out of envelope performance to be addressed)Visualisation of requirements and cost driversFlexibility to changing requirements/environmentSupport of  the evaluation of human factorsRepresentation of the whole system, user and environmentHowever, whilst the potential benefits to the procurement process are relatively well understood, many have yet to be realised. This has been due, to some extent, to perceived problems in the use of extant modelling and simulation resources in the construction of SEs and lack of confidence in the output of modelling and simulation. Consistency and coherence of SEs Synthetic environments are generally constructed from a number of modelling and simulation resources, often developed in isolation, within areas of expertise. The integration of such resources may therefore be less than straightforward, particularly if accompanied by the ‘stovepipe’ culture. The integration process is relatively immature and therefore lacks necessary rigour, which may result in the construction of inconsistent and incoherent SEs. These may therefore be of limited use locally and may not translate across sibling systems or throughout the system lifecycle which they may be required to support.In order to provide the necessary level of confidence to the ‘user’, there is a need to address the process of SE development, to ensure rigour, comparability and compatible with other SEs and facilitate their federation into larger SEs (as the system lifecycle progresses). This must also be coupled to an understanding of the relationship between the development lifecycle of the SE and that of the system which it supports/represents in order to best direct modelling and simulation resources to ensure that SEs meet the needs of the SPI.Linking modelling and simulationTo date, much of the research work carried out in the area of SEs has been driven by the technology issues surrounding the linking of modelling and simulation resources. This has resulted in the development of Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) and High Level Architecture (HLA) protocols and the realisation of on-line SEs which can link geographically disparate ‘players’ into interactive situations.However, consideration needs to be given to the requirements placed upon modelling and simulation by this approach to the construction of SEs. In particular the use of such protocols may preclude the use of legacy modelling and simulation resources and as such would necessitate significant re-work in order to achieve compliance.In addition, consideration should be given to the need for the on-line linking of models and simulations. Whilst in certain applications of SEs this may be wholly appropriate, within other applications it may be unnecessary. Furthermore, inconsistencies (manifested as compound errors) may be introduced in to SEs through the linking of models and simulations which require interpretation of their outputs (either as a result of assumptions made in their construction or due to their application outside of their intended / designed envelope).The Solution DomainConsideration of the problem domain highlights the need for the development and management of processes to address the following issues:The need for SEs to support the management of defence capabilityThe need to develop consistent and coherent SEsThe management of defence capabilityThe achievement of defence capability management firstly requires the comparison of required and delivered capabilities in order to identify and characterise capability shortfalls. Within the ethos of capability management, an holistic approach is taken to the resolution of these shortfalls through the most appropriate solutions. A perceived application of SEs within this process is to facilitate the evaluation of potential solutions, to meet capability shortfalls. There is, therefore, a need for SEs which can ultimately be utilised in the comparison of competing systems on a ‘level playing field’ and thereby inform the decision making process.The context of SEs with respect to the capability management process is developed in the following sub-section.A model for the management of capabilityThe Studies Assumptions Group (SAG) scenarios provide illustrative strategic settings and a global context for possible conflict scenarios in which UK and allied armed forces involvement would be likely. They include representative sequences of likely events and are based largely upon, world affairs.Military Tasks (MTs) represent the means by which UK defence policy would be implemented, taking account of UK armed forces doctrine. They are conveniently grouped into Military Missions, in accordance with UK defence policy.Together (SAGs+MTs) provide the only accepted settings for military activities in the context of UK defence policy (realistic force deployment within credible situations) and as such provide the common baseline for the examination of military capability. They are considered to be the ‘acid test’ for the justification of defence procurement. (NB. the use of generic scenarios is not normally endorsed by MOD.) Use of any particular SAG scenario requires it to be ‘worked-up’, by an appropriate military advisory panel, in order to provide necessary detail for its conduct and identify measures of effectiveness (MoEs) with respect to scenario end-states etc. against which the success of the scenario can be judged.A SAG scenario could potentially be conducted with numerous variations (whilst still within the original setting) to take account of different military capabilities and hence equipments which could be employed in pursuit of the scenario MoE. This would therefore require the scenario to be worked-up with respect to equipments/solutions, and as such result in an agreed set of SAG scenario variations, all with the same end-state MoE.With reference to Figure 1, it has been considered that within each of the capability areas, identified under the SPI, e.g. Control & Denial of the Below Water Battlespace, are characterised by several primary functions, such as Underwater Weapons, Underwater Sensors etc. These functions are supported by military systems/equipments, such as Future Attack Submarine (FASM), Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) etc. which can therefore be considered to be the physical manifestation of capability.Figure 1 Capability OverviewThis facilitates the description of military systems/equipments in terms of their functionality with respect to capability areas. This direct link between capability and system/equipment is of particular interest, since it permits the examination of capability through the assessment of systems/equipments within the context of a SAG scenario.This provides necessary credibility through consistency with UK defence policy. Furthermore, utilisation of SAG scenarios provides a common baseline against which capabilities (via systems/equipments) can be examined, thus promoting consistency and coherence throughout the management of capability.Within the current capability management organisation, there are a number of discrepancies regarding the assignment of systems/equipments to capability areas. These can be considered to fall into three categories:Systems currently identified as having multi-role capability. These have already been recognised and as such are noted within current documentation as having been grouped according to their primary capability.Systems with currently unrecognised multi-role capability. These are not recognised, many of which could be realised by incorporation of specific sub-systems.Major sub-systems. Only those sub-systems which constituted major procurement/development programmes prior to the change over to capability management are identified (understood to be due to the need to assign responsibility for major programmes already underway).The separation of major sub-system programmes from their host platforms serves to highlight the potential for the realisation of capability by otherwise unconsidered combinations of platforms and sub-systems, in order to address specific scenarios. The potential economies associated with the re-use of technologies across a number of platforms could otherwise remain unrealised. With reference to Figure 2, it can be seen that the systems required to realise capability can be considered to be composed of those which ‘enable’ (e.g. weapon system) and those which ‘deliver’ (i.e. platform). Figure 2 Capability Overview – System DetailConsideration of capability in terms of required functionality, permits more precise mapping of capabilities to systems/equipments, transgressing the perceived boundaries of the capability areas. This is further facilitated by the decomposition to ‘enabling’ and ‘delivering’ system. Scrutinising the capability/system mappings across all capability areas may identify more appropriate groupings of systems to capability areas, although the problem of assigning multiple-capability systems will undoubtedly remain. However, it is considered more important that the relationships between delivering systems, enabling systems and capabilities are identified, understood and appropriately addressed within the management of capability. Figure 3, represents an indicative process for the evaluation of capability. A capability specific system option (e.g. FASM + Torpedoes) is utilised by the appropriate low-level scenario (as derived from the worked-up SAG scenario). System specific modelling and simulation resources, as identified by the Roadmap (discussed in sub-section 3.3) represent this. Figure 3 Capability EvaluationSince the system option represents a proportion of the capability, all systems which contribute to that capability must be similarly exercised in order to build up a comprehensive picture of that capability. Similarly, the achievement of capability management requires all other capability areas to be comprehensively exercised, to build-up a complete view of defence capability and thus allow capability shortfalls to be identified.It should also be noted that all appropriate permutations, combinations and variations of systems and scenarios need to be exercised in order to develop the complete view. However, once developed it is henceforth available for re-use in the management of capability. Consideration should be given to multiple concurrent scenarios (maybe require a higher level SAG to examine the possible combinations of scenarios).The roadmap conceptIt is considered that the evaluation of capability necessitates extensive use of modelling and simulation resources (a key tenet of the SPI). The Roadmap concept has been developed to aid the identification of these resources and address the issues of consistency and coherence.The Roadmap describes a set of software components (models, simulators, and systems) and the data/information they require in answering a question or supporting a particular process. Although bearing some similarity to the HLA Federation Development and Execution Process (FEDEP), it is wider scope in order to address the use of modelling and simulation within the procurement process. A number of the information sources for a component are likely to be derived from other components, and these important relationships will be defined in the roadmap. Common sources of data, which will be used by different models, can be identified as areas for consistency checking, and also to highlight the possible adoption of standards to represent the data. As the Roadmaps will be associated to either a question or process they will be available throughout the lifecycle for reuse to support the re-running of activities as required, albeit with new versions of models or data.Figure 4 The Roadmap ConceptAn example Roadmap is shown in Figure 4. This is a contextual Roadmap (since the specific modelling and simulation resources have been omitted although their functionality and the nature of information flow between them are included) which has been developed to address a question regarding sortie generation for the future UK aircraft carrier. Although in this instance the Roadmap has been used to answer a specific question, it has been considered that generic capability Roadmaps could be developed, possibly in terms of the following functions:CommandMobilityFirepowerProtectionInformation & IntelligenceCombat Service SupportThese would then be populated with appropriate and specific modelling and simulation resources, with respect to the scenario and system options (such as submarine, ship, helicopter etc.) being considered.NB. The Roadmap identifies the modelling and simulation resources required to address a particular process/question. It does not state how the Roadmap should be implemented (such as real-time linking, off-line linking, the use of HLA etc.) Roadmap development processIt is considered that the process involved in the development of a roadmap would generally follow the outline process (which is illustrated at each phase with the development of a generic surveillance Roadmap) as follows:Identification of primary functions - It was considered that in generic terms, the conduct of surveillance is primarily reliant upon three closely coupled functions: Remaining undetectedSensing the “target”Relaying acquired informationDetermine the means of assessment – The achievement of these functions may be measured in terms of their respective performance (Signature, Sensors and Communications), while the achievement of surveillance requires aggregation of the functions in order to provide a meaningful measure of performance. This high-level process is represented in the Figure 5.  EMBED Word.Picture.8  Figure 5. Surveillance High-Level ProcessIdentify the relationships between functions - The functional interdependencies correspond to positive (+VE) and negative (-VE) influences, and represent what is assumed to be the general case as follows:Signature – with increasing signature, sensor and communication performance are degraded (due to interference) and surveillance is degraded (due to the increased likelihood of being detected).Sensor Performance – with increasing sensor performance, surveillance is enhanced (due to increased sensing of the target), signature is degraded and communication performance is degraded (due to interference).Communication Performance – with increasing communication performance, surveillance is enhanced (due to improved relaying of acquired information), signature and sensor performance are degraded (due to interference).The emergent complex interdependencies, between the surveillance functions, suggests that the process requires an iterative approach in order to attain an equilibrium (and hence a stable indication of surveillance performance). Identify the significant influences upon each of the functions - Identification of the significant influences upon each of the functions serves to identify likely drivers for the achievement of the functions, and hence areas which should be represented within supporting modelling and simulation.Figure 6. Surveillance Primary Modelling & SimulationEach of the three functional domains, Signature, Sensors and Communication, will comprise an appropriate set of models and simulations for the performance evaluation of its respective domain. The supporting secondary level of modelling, simulation and data sets (platform characteristics etc.) provides a contextual reference to the primary modelling activity and would be configured as a consistent set of models/simulation/data, viewed from each respective functional domain. e.g. A single representation of the environment could be viewed in terms of Signature (visual cues due to induced motion etc.) and in terms of Sensor Performance (background noise etc.). This approach serves to ensure the consistency of the primary modelling activity.Determine MoEs/MoPs – Having determined the means of assessment and the interactions and drivers of the contributing factors, metrics for measuring the achievement of surveillance must be determined. These would be context specific (i.e. dependent upon the surveillance scenario) and would be developed from a military perspective and provide, at the highest level, a probabilistic measures of effectiveness such as [X]% probability of conducting a surveillance mission for a period [Y] in the location [Z] and remaining undetected. Lower level MoEs and MoPs would support this, according to the required effectiveness of each function (necessary to achieve the overall MoE) and the implied performance required of the systems supporting each function.Populate with modelling and simulation - Having established the underlying process, consideration must be given to the resolution of each function, in terms of addressing the MoEs/MoPs through the application of modelling, simulation and supporting data.In order to assist with the identification of modelling and simulation resources (or indeed the identification of a shortfall in resources) each of the primary domains would be explored in terms of the potential areas to be addressed/modelled/simulated and the viewpoints required of secondary level modelling and simulation.Candidate modelling and simulation resources would then be identified from the DERA Models Directory and assessed with respect to their applicability to the Roadmap and the nature of interdependencies  between resources (such as information flow and the information required to support the production of the MoEs and MoPs).The SE / system relationshipThe relationship between systems and their supporting SEs is shown in Figure 7. The acquisition spiral represents the iterative execution of a system engineering lifecycle process from the definition of capability to its realisation. Throughout this process the supporting SE will be increasing in fidelity towards the solution (with the use of more detailed modelling and simulation resources to populate the Roadmap), eventually being populated with tangible equipments, operators etc. Figure 7 The Acquisition SpiralManagement of SEsHaving established the importance of assembling and configuring the right set of SE components for the question to be addressed and identified a process to assist with these tasks, issues associated with the implementation of an SE are discussed in the following section. Implementation requires appropriate management, in order to co-ordinate the potentially large numbers of models and simulations, associated volumes of data and people (such as decision makers, modellers etc.). Electronic Product and Process Management (EPPM) tools have been identified as a possible solution.Although more commonly used in the management of static information, such as ‘product trees’ in the automotive industry, it has been considered that EPPM tools may be equally applicable to the management of dynamic modelling and simulation resources. The application of an EPPM tool (Figure 8) facilitates the bringing together of modelling and simulation resources, people (such as IPTs, Capability Managers and experts for the implementation and interpretation of models and simulations) and data (within a common data repository). This is effected within a common infrastructure which provides for control (change control, access control etc.) of the process, thereby further promotes consistency and coherence. Figure 8 EPPM ApplicationFurther WorkThe realisation of SEs to support the SPI necessitates the advancement of many of the ideas outlined in this paper. In particular, having established the means of linking models and simulations, significant effort must be focussed on the achievement of consistent and coherent SEs, if their potential is to be exploited.The development and application of process is considered to be of key importance in the pursuit of this goal, the basis of which is the clarification and acceptance of the capability management process. This is considered essential, in order to provide a context for the application of SEs within the SPI.Within the UK Maritime SeBA team, work is progressing to develop both the capability management process and the underpinning Roadmaps. The development of capability Roadmaps in support of two future vessel programmes is currently underway. The application of EPPM tools is also being examined further, with the implementation of the sortie generation rate Roadmap in support of the future UK aircraft carrier.Author BiographiesSIMON H MARSHALL is a Senior Engineer within the UK maritime SeBA team.
