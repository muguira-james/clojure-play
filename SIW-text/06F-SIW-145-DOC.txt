Recommend splitting into 2 half sessions in Spring to allow time for thought ( make it a real workshop). Attendance dropped after the afternoon break (by a third) and picked up later. I would like to schedule workshop for Message Passing Protocol for that time period in the Spring SIW so that I can better assure good papers having a good audience. We went to supper at Chili’s rather than have pizza in the room and talk about interoperability.  That was good for building the network but we were unable to have any discussion. The discussion on Message Passing Protocol reached the conclusion that the study group should remain as an element of the Space community Forum with Ralph Weber as mentor and manager. The TOR quickly rewritten (to reflect the evening’s discussion) will circulate among interested proponents before being posted shortly on the SISO site. Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)28Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)34Peak attendance (including joint sessions)NATotal papers presented7 *“No-show” presentations0Other presentations and panel discussions3* Larry Green #010 had notified us that he would be unable to attend.
