Name of Forum or Group:   Analysis ForumChairLT Benson Lo, USN, for Dr. Cam TranVice ChairJohn FaySecretaryEmmet BeekerObjectives for this Workshop:Explore new techniques, practices, and tools for modeling, simulation, and analysis.Familiarize the audience with initiatives and specifications under development at SISO.   In particular, we provide the opportunity for the Open Source Initiative for Parallel and Distributed Modeling and Simulation (OSI-PDMS) to present an overview of the effort leading to the newly proposed study group.Comments and Recommendations:1.  The morning started great with a SIWzie-nominated paper (010) presentation.  The presenter described a study for simulated Marine infantry movement and was very interesting.  Along with that paper, several others were also worth reading.  Audience posed great questions.  Another SIWzie-nominated paper (044) was presented after the first break.2.  We had a joint session with RD&E for paper 058.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)23Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)29Peak attendance (including joint sessions)29Total papers presented11“No-show” presentations1Other presentations and panel discussions0Recommended Reading List nomination: 07F-SIW-010 – Marine Advance Unit, Infantry (MAUI), Study – NSWC Dahlgren Division developed M&S baseline scenarios to analyze the capabilities of the Marine Corps infantry squad.07F-SIW-044 – A Proposed Open System Architecture for Modeling and Simulation (OSAMS) – describes how modern component-based interoperability technologies can be standardized to lower costs of next generation models for the DoD and industry.                   2007 FALL SIW OUTBRIEF FORM
