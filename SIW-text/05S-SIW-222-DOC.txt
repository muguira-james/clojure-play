The workshop location is convenient as other hotels and restaurants surround it. The atmosphere was nice and the hotel service was excellent; they promptly assisted us with finding another meeting room as our scheduled room became too small for an unexpected large audience.2.	The workshop was well organized and many presentations were very beneficial to the community. The workshop gave the Study Group an opportunity to introduce the MSDL to the community and to recruit the contributions from all over the world to the product development.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)56Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)60Peak attendance (including joint sessions)NATotal papers presented4“No-show” presentations0Other presentations and panel discussionsQuestions & Answers session about MSDLRecommended Reading List nominations (including previous nominations):1.	05S-SIW-0072.	05S-SIW-0193.	05S-SIW-1082005 SPRING SIW OUTBRIEF FORM
