The revised GRIM 2d17 will be named 2d17v2.RPR FOM StatusGraham has done all action items except maybe latest enums.The 1516 version has changes from the 1.3 version. However translation created ugly long names for datatypes.  Graham suggests we go forward with these names and address them in balloting. The one exception is to replace or escape the “/” character in order to make the xml files parsable.Graham will generate the 2d18 version a week from next Monday.GRIM StatusSteve addressed all outstanding the comments.  These comment resolutions need review. Some additional editorial fixes were made and indicated by new comments. The title is 2d18 and it needs to be renamed to 2d17v2.Schedule:March 30 - GRIM 2d17v2.April 9 - RPR-FOM (1.3, 1516) 2d18. April 16- GRIM 2d18 ripple update.April 30 - Focused review on RPR-FOM and GRIM 2d18 comment implementation.April 30 - Vote to go to ballot.Action Items:070329-1: Graham / Monday April 9 - post RPR FOM 2d18 on reflector070329-2: Steve / Friday March 30 - post GRIM 2d17v2 on reflector070329-3: Steve / Monday April 16 - post GRIM 2d18 on reflector
