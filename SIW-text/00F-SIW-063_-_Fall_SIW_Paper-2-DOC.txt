Because of the increased importance of M&S, it is incumbent upon the Defense community to ensure that the M&S and its data accurately reflect the real-world and are being used appropriately.

VV&A, when performed in parallel with the M&S LCM process, captures and questions vital information to support the user's requirements.  Established VV&A guidelines serve as the unbiased internal assessment of the M&S.

IntroductionModels and simulations (M&S) have become more prominent in daily operations supporting the Force and major decisions by the Department of Defense and Congress. Along with the rapid growth in the use of M&S are the various views and interpretations of M&S.   This includes understanding what verification, validation and accreditation (VV&A) truly means as it relates to M&S.  What most fail to realize is that VV&A is at the heart of the M&S credibility issue.  Additionally, as resources, money, people and time shrink, the use of an accredited M&S becomes paramount.  An accredited M&S, with its heritage, lineage or pedigree, provides the users and developers with useful information to determine if the M&S and its data identified meets a specific need, as is or with some modifications.  Because of this, VV&A can be identified as “a friend to M&S” for the following reasons.  First, for the M&S developer, VV&A provides a structured format and process to ensure that the M&S developer built the M&S and data according to the requirements and capabilities criteria outlined by the user. Furthermore, it provides internal checkpoints, and encourages communication between the users, developers, programmers and subject matter experts, which helps to mitigate risks.  Second, for the M&S users, VV&A provides a structured format to ascertain if the initial operational requirements and criteria were actually achievable and if not, why.  Last but not least, VV&A is not new, but standardizing a M&S VV&A format and incorporating it into the M&S LCM process as an integral step is new.The purpose of this paper is to enlighten the Defense community about the importance of VV&A, which is vital to the credibility of the M&S supporting our Forces’ as they                                       Figure 1.

Why was VV&A developed?The Department of Defense (DoD) has long recognized the value of models and simulations (M&S) which can be found in every aspect of DoD.   Models and simulations support major DoD decisions (such as the Defense Acquisition Board; the Joint Requirements Oversight Council; and the DoD Planning, Programming, and Budgeting system) and assess the performance of the war-fighter and his equipment (e.g., Joint Warfare System (JWARS) and the Land Warrior system supporting Joint Vision 2010).  Therefore, in 1994 DoD Directive 5000.59, Modeling and Simulation Master Plan, mandated verification, validation, and accreditation (VV&A) policies, procedures and guidelines be established.   Further, the Army stated in Army Regulation 5-11, Management, Verification, Validation, and Accreditation of Army Model and Simulation, that VV&A will be conducted concurrently as part of the M&S life cycle management (LCM) process for each individual model and simulation.  The table above identifies the steps within the M&S LCM and the related VV&A actions and products for each.3.  What is VV&A? The first step in trying to correct the misunderstanding of VV&A as it relates to M&S is defining what the process and each term means.  Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&A) is a process to ensure that each model and simulation and its data are being used appropriately for a specific purpose.  In others words, making certain that the M&S being used to evaluate a system is using the right algorithms, the right data, etc… for the right reason.Now let’s breakdown the meaning of the individual terms of  VV&A to establish a foundation to build upon.Accreditation, which is the desired end result, is defined as the official determination that a M&S is acceptable for a specific purpose. However, the accreditation decision is based on properly performed and documented verification and validation (V&V) activities that support it.  Verification questions whether the model and simulation work as intended?  Specifically, verification is the process of determining that an M&S accurately represents the developer's conceptual description and specifications.  Also, verification evaluates the extent that the M&S have been developed using sound and standard software engineering techniques.  Verification is applied at each stage of the M&S life cycle management process to ensure that the inputs and outputs are implemented accurately and properly as well as support the purpose of the M&S.  Therefore, verification double-checks if the M&S’ code and logic are correct and perform the intended functions accurately.  In short, verification builds confidence in the structural integrity of the M&S. Validation addresses the question, is the model realistic?  Specifically, validation is the process of determining the degree to which a model and simulation accurately represent the real world from the perspective of its intended use.  Thus, validation examines the concept and output thoroughly.  Data obtained from the real world or a credible source, which has been proven by a recognized expert is used to compare the M&S’ behavior and results.  In short, validation is the cornerstone by which the M&S’ credibility is built.Verification and validation are complementary processes and together function similar to the quality control used in a manufacturing process.   Ultimately, the combined purpose of verification and validation is to support the accreditation process and ensure the M&S provides credible results and satisfies the users operational needs. All V&V actions are documented in two forms, the V&V plan and the V&V report.  The V&V Plan is the road map outlining general descriptions, management procedures, information sources, design, schedule, evaluation criteria, and deliverables.  The V&V report documents the results of the V&V process of an M&S.  Specifically, it should provide an objective view on the M&S' strengths and weaknesses with regard to the intended use of the M&S.  The information should also be outlined in the same sequential format outlined by the V&V plan and address any differences.  At the conclusion of the report a statement on the confidence and credibility of the M&S relative to the intended use is required.Accreditation addresses the question, is this M&S acceptable or suitable for a specific use?  Accreditation is the official determination that a M&S is acceptable for a specific purpose.  Thus, accreditation is a set of formal procedures to gain confidence in an M&S.  Accreditation is a decision to use an M&S and its results for a particular application.  However, it is based on properly performed and documented V&V information, which is used to compare against an exit criteria, formally called acceptability criteria.  It is developed and documented at the beginning of the M&S life cycle management process.   The acceptability criteria are unique to each M&S and provide essential insights to possible solutions.   Therefore, the acceptability criteria are standards that the M&S must meet in order to be accredited for a specific use.The accreditation decision of each M&S is supported by four documents: the V&V report, the accreditation acceptability criteria report, accreditation plan, and the accreditation report.  The accreditation acceptability criteria report is a document describing how and why the accreditation criteria was established and how much of the criteria must be met to satisfy acceptance of the M&S.  At a minimum, this document should identify the "bare bones" criteria needed to satisfy the M&S' accreditation for this specific use. The accreditation plan is the road map outlining the background, accreditation responsibilities, schedules, resources, acceptability criteria and the proposed accreditation methods.  In summary, this plan provides the means to analyze and exercise the M&S' capabilities and limitations relative for this specific use.  The accreditation report tells if the M&S has been granted or denied.  This report is supported by an accreditation assessment.  This assessment is based on the initial criteria standards identified in the accreditation acceptability criteria report.  Additionally, the degree of confidence in the M&S' results are documented along with any recommendations, capabilities and limitations.4.  But how can VV&A be conducted successfully?There are six keys to conduct a successful M&S VV&A.  1)  VV&A should be involved at the beginning of the M&S planning and preparation stage, when developing or modifying a M&S, it should not be an afterthought.  Initiating VV&A after the M&S is completed or during a later phase of development/modification can be costly in terms of time and people resources.  Because, if a precedent was not established at the beginning, important information may not be documented, such as a complete configuration management log stating differences between the versions and the reasons for the changes made.  2)  Realize that some verification and validation activities are conducted on M&S when developed or modified; though the information is not be captured.   Also realize that if software is included in the M&S there is a minimum level confidence and credibility because all software must go through the VV&A process resulting in a quality certification document.  This certification consists of information the product, process and personnel.  3)  Know how to accredit.  First, you must a clear understanding of the official DoD definition of accreditation.  Then second, you must be able to relate this to the M&S and the resulting implications regarding what must be done to accredit the M&S.  This is key to a cost effective VV&A plan.4)  Understanding the problem. This means having a clear understanding of the problem that this M&S is trying to resolve or support.  In other words, what decision must be made?  Additionally, this means identifying an initial set of model requirements, I say initial because the requirements may evolve as the M&S is tested and executed.  Some of the questions that should be asked are what parameters are used to characterize the information?  And what threshold values are acceptable?  This is essential for determining accreditation requirements.5)  Derive M&S requirements.  The M&S requirements are the developer’s interpretation of the requirements to which the M&S will be constructed.  These requirements are linked to the conceptual model, which is a set of assumptions, limitations, algorithms, equations and preliminary listing of elements with possible connections to another M&S with similar application.  The conceptual model is an iterative process, allowing conceptual developer to communicate with data producers, intended data users and subject matter experts.  The M&S requirements should describe what the model should do, how it should do it, what environmental factors will influence the functions, what the inputs are to be included that influence the model, what outputs are desired, how the model will be run (using what computer equipment and software), and any other factors that will affect the outputs.  The process in determining M&S requirements is a very critical step, which is instrumental in preventing major M&S inadequacies and ensuring that the M&S is realistic.6) Tailor accreditation requirements. Tailoring the accreditation information requirements can be done in two ways.  The first is to identify the minimum essential information that is needed to support a reasonable decision.  The intent is to eliminate excessive requirements and minimize the amount of work that is needed to collect and document the information.  The minimum information requirements can be determined based on the level of credibility needed in the application.  The second tailoring technique is to focus V&V efforts on selected parts or functions within the model that have the greatest impact on the model outputs and, in turn, on the metrics of interest in this particular problem.  Identifying the important metrics in the problem and the parts of the model that have the greatest impact on these metrics and model outputs does this.When these planning steps are adhered to a focused and efficient set of activities are conducted leading to a successful VV&A process that is cost-effective.5.  What are the goals of VV&A? So, what should be gained by implementing this VV&A process?  There should be an increase in commonality, reuse, interoperability, use of standards, and the number of standards.  Commonality means the M&S when possible should use "like" and everyday terms (e.g., terrain should be identified in either miles or kilometers).  Reuse means that a model can be used over and over again.  For example, the Heat Stress Model developed by the U.S. Army Institute of Environmental Medicine to explore the soldier's performance under various combat conditions was discovered to have useful properties to design uniforms for the soldier.  Thus, after extensive V&V analysis resulting with credible performance data comparable with actual exercises, this model was accredited for a second specific use.    Interoperability is the ability to exchange or swap a sub-programs within a M&S, called an object, with another M&S' object without interrupting operational effectiveness.  For example, objects being exchanged between M&S is similar to the United States' and the United Kingdom's armies being able to use each other's ammunition in like weapon systems.   Use of standards, such as target acquisition algorithms in the Model and Simulation Resource Repository (MSRR), decreases the resources needed to conduct V&V efforts.  Additionally, it increases the new user's confidence due to the history already established.   And as new M&S are developed or modified, with new algorithms and data, then the number of accredited standards should increase.  Within the Army each new proposed standard must go through the Army M&S Standards Development Process to gain consensus from a community of experts, which is rigorous.  Afterwards these standards are submitted to the Deputy Under Secretary of the Army (Operations Research) for approval.  If approved, then the standard is submitted to the MSRR.6.  What are the benefits of VV&A?The benefits derived from using VV&A are a reduction in duplication and cost and an increase in confidence and credibility.   Reduction in duplication and cost means leveraging technologies and using our shrinking resources to explore other viable approaches to support the force.   VV&A means an increase in confidence and credibility to users because there is less risk and a greater assurance of success.  Our success impacts the soldier's survivability, sustainability, and achievability of their mission on the battlefield.   This is important since M&S are used for embedded training and distance learning of the soldier instead of stand-alone devices at fixed sites.  Additionally, M&S have been instrumental by the Commanders in Chief (CINC) to rehearse potential missions.  Thus M&S have been influential with changes to doctrine and provide "the edge" needed for precision engagements as part of a dominant force on the battlefield. 7.  ConclusionThis paper tried to present a clearer understanding on what verification, validation and accreditation is in relationship to M&S and how it can be of benefit ensuring that the M&S developed or modified met its intended purpose.
