As communications from the U.S. Military Satellite Communications System to commercial satellite phones become reliant on these various satellite architectures, modeling their designs provides a valuable tool to assess capability.Simulating satellite communications capabilities integrates various satellite system infrastructures, illustrating communications networks, from handheld radios and the public telephone network to high-speed digital networks for voice, video, and data. This simulation capability also provides suitability of various net-centric tactical communications solutions for application to future programs, using the Army’s Computer Generated Forces-OneSAF, the developing COMPOSER Communication Effect Simulator (CES) and a space server for satellite locations.	The initial activities to evaluate satellite communications capabilities include:the use of satellite relays to reduce the number of terrestrial communications relays; the use of a satellite “switch in the sky” backbone network to reduce node centers; increasing the Commander’s span of control for battlespace engagement; projecting the Global Information Grid to the forward line of troops; satellite communications impact on network survivability with respect to various threats such as attack, sabotage, and electronic warfare; and enabling battle command on the move.  Simulating Communications through Satellite Capabilities provides the ability to plan military activities and missions via satellite communications anywhere, anytime. IntroductionAs services rely more and more on space for Command and Control and Information Operations Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (IO-ISR) purposes, common data standards for space communications aids in representing that structure.  Bridging the gap in space communication and representation of space assets plays a large role in defining current and future system architectures for network-centric agile satellite systems to help tactical warfighters access and share trusted information from any location to make better decisions of operational effectiveness and force structure throughout the battlespace environment.   Currently, there are over two hundred U.S. Satellites in orbit that offer a wide variety of technological capabilities at many frequency bands. Developing modeling and simulation allows representation of space assets to transition current and future communications technology.  The creation of a new space communications Basic Object Model (BOM) for satellite communications provides common representation of space and would support the U.S. Army Concept for Space Operations develops solutions to enable the capabilities for the warfighter to:Support increased deployability and reduced theater footprintAchieve situational understanding “Off the Ramp” during entry operationsSupport precision maneuver, fires, sustainment, and informationEnable continuous information and decision superiorityProtect the force during all phases of the operationSpace Operations issues historically addresses problems with reliability and timeliness of the service, significant operational friction, and excessive technical and procedural seams.  Current modeling and simulation tools do not adequately represent space communications assets and their impact on full spectrum operations. To address the lack of representation in modeling and simulation and to evaluate the effects of space on communications, an initial space communications capability links satellite simulation tools with the latest communications representation connectivity and bandwidth of space based communications systems representation.  This initial federation integrates space communications effects which enable the evaluation of the role space in achieving reliable theater and global communications for the warfighter.  One use is to evaluate the benefits of Leveraging Space Communications Assets to include the following:The use of satellite relays to reduce the number of terrestrial communications relays (Force Protection)The use of a satellite “switch in the sky” backbone network to reduce node centersIncreasing the Commander’s span of control for battlespace engagementProjecting the Global Information Grid to the forward line of troopsNetwork survivability to various threats such as attack, sabotage, and electronic warfareEnabling battle command on the moveObjectiveThe initial Federation Object Model (FOM) of this satellite communications capability can analyze the space communications effects on network-centric operations and offer an initial space communications object model that can be expanded as future requirements and functionality dictate within the services communications infrastructure. The realistic representation of the effects space has on battle command systems highlights the importance of space-based assets and potential improvements needed to those systems.  Areas which were evaluated and measured based on real world space operations requirements include line of sight, network survivability, and space for span of control. The first scenario evaluates the benefit of space for Line of Sight.  It uses a Field Artillery Call for Fire Scenario involving a Forward Observer without Line-of-Sight to the Supported Maneuver Unit and Supporting Field Artillery Unit.  This scenario highlights how space can provide information when line of sight on the battlefield is not available. Line-of-Sight (LOS) is considered and provides a rich battlespace environment to model and simulate elements ranging from small Special Operations Forces to Brigade Combat Teams up to Unified Combatant Commands exercising global operations.  Vignettes with current, future, and objective force communications systems will provide the data for a comparative analysis of the warfighter’s communications capability and its impact on full spectrum operations. The next scenario illustrates network survivability and evaluates Terrestrial Network Attack, Electronic Warfare—subject to available threat representations, “Automatic” Fallback to Space, Requires “orders” on the net (probably via a human interactor).The third vignette looks at space for span of control illustrating the value of space based communications for controlling forces.Initial Satellite Communications Capability ComponentsAs warfighting becomes increasingly modernized through the use of network-centric warfare, communication becomes more critical.  Adding communication effects through satellite capabilities to existing war games can be achieved through HLA, DIS, and TCP/IP sockets providing quantitative results from the communications effects simulator.The federation integrates SMDC’s Space Server, OneSAF and a Communications Effects Simulator (CES) capability (i.e., Communications Planner for Operational and Simulation Effects with Realism’s (COMPOSER) CES Suite or QualNet). The current FOM utilizes the CERDEC’s Communications Planner for Operational and Simulation Effects with Realism’s (COMPOSER) Communications Effects Simulator (CES) Suite, and  One Semi-Automated Forces (OneSAF). 3.1 Space ServerThe SMDC Space Server provides a common representation of space-based assets.  It consists of a modular simulation architecture that supports the integration of multiple simulation components.  This generic interface allows integration of a large number of space simulations and models to meet the operational objectives of the user.The Space Server models the satellite constellation. An external satellite propagation model provides the orbital characteristics of the satellite constellations to the Space Server.  The Space Server then utilizes this data to generate dynamic satellite state updates for use by the CES.The Space Server provides satellite constellation representations at the entity level.  Specific attribute information provided for each satellite instance includes: Satellite ID Position, Velocity, & Acceleration Line-of-Sight Platform Power Status RF Degradation AttributeThe satellite state information is provided to the federation at a periodic rate.  The Platform Power Status indicates the current power status of the satellite platform.  The RF Degradation Attribute represents RF attenuation (dB/km), and is used to approximate related phenomena (e.g. space weather) that impacts signal strength.  The Line-of-Sight attribute indicates whether the satellite instance is within LOS of a pre-defined geographical Area-of-Interest (AOI).  This satellite state information is utilized by the CES Suite to continuously model space-based link performance.3.2 Communication Effects Simulator (CES) SuiteInitial capability consists of the CES Suite Communication Effects Simulator (CES), a Network Visualizer (NV), and an HLA interface.  It is capable of simulating and visualizing communications effects due to changes to system performance, maneuver and environmental conditions.  The CES models communications effects by taking into consideration:Specifics of the selected military radio waveforms.Environmental factors (such as terrain).Radio transmission effects (such as transmit power levels, relative positions of transmitters and receivers, configured channel or frequency of operation, delays due to RF propagation, and sources of interference).Network effects (such as message latency and message completion rates).A CES provides representations of the communication payloads that reside on each satellite by synchronizing the transceiver to the entity state information provided by the Space Server (essentially marrying the payload to the platform).  When a message is sent through the space-based link, the communications effects space module (located in the CES Suite) determines if the message reaches its destination.  If it does, the message is passed onto the next network link.  If not, the message is lost.  A log of the messages that are passed on and those lost (on a link by link basis) is used to verify that the model has the desired results.  This also shows the importance of considering space effects when analyzing communications networks.  3.3 OneSAFOneSAF simulates individual battlefield components such as soldiers, tanks, and helicopters through aggregate or entity based units, up to the brigade level, operating in either a completely automated mode or under the control of the training audience via their organic command and control systems or role players.  It is the scenario driver for various tactical scenarios created within OneSAF to demonstrate the effects of space-based communications nodes on the battlefield.  In addition to unit and entity attributes, the following information is provided as inputs to the CES Suite from OneSAF:  terrain characteristics, communication equipment frequencies or channels used by the transmitter and receiver characteristics of the devices communicating with the satellites such as position, power settings and antenna attitude as well as the transmitter characteristics of potential interferers.3.4 High Level Architecture (HLA) ImplementationThe satellite communications capability utilizes an HLA network architecture to federate the models mentioned.  A runtime infrastructure (RTI) from Virtual Technology Corporation is used for the HLA federation.  The initial Federation Object Model (FOM) can be changed or updated to focus on basic real-time interoperability or a format that supports specific parts of a simulation or federation which can be extracted and reused as modeling building-blocks or components.VignettesVignettes with current, future, and objective force communications systems provide the data for a comparative analysis of the warfighter’s communications capability and its impact on full spectrum operations.  Three vignettes focus on Line of Sight, Network Survivability, and Space for Span of Control.Line of Sight VignetteThe line of sight vignette illustrates the importance space provides in terrain obstruction situations.  The functionality of the space communications effects simulation evaluates measuring the number of tactical messages created by OneSAF units that utilize the space-based relay.4.1.1 Line of Sight OverviewThis vignette illustrates the use of space when two friendly units are unable to communicate via terrestrial or airborne assets due to terrain and distance.  Space Server provides a single satellite platform to the federation.  COMPOSER CES attaches a communications transceiver model to the space server platform creating a space based communications relay model.  The satellite relay allows the units to communicate effectively.  Integration of this effort includes successful communication between all federates, OneSAF units utilizing the COMPOSER CES for their tactical communications networks, COMPOSER utilizing the Space Server satellite object for implementing a space-based relay and OneSAF units utilizing the space communications relay to communicate tactical messages to additional units outside the range of terrestrial and airborne communications relays.4.1.2 Line of Sight ScenarioThe vignette focuses on a friendly (blue force) infantry battalion maneuvering towards the end of a mountain range.  The battalion is supported by two forward observer platoons and two field artillery platoons.  Two enemy (red force) infantry battalions will be located on the opposite side of the mountain range heading towards the end of the range to engage the friendly battalion.  The friendly forward observer platoons are maneuvering at a safe distance from the threat forces on the red side of the range.  The forward observers detect the red forces as unknown units and track them to obtain positive identification.  The platoon leader transmits a situation report to the blue force battalion commander located on the opposite side of the range via the space-based communications relay stating that unknown targets have been detected.  The battalion commander receives this message and relays this information to the artillery platoon leader which in turn is disseminated to both artillery units (Figure 3).Once the forward observers have positively identified the units as red forces the platoon leader transmits the updated track and identification to the battalion commander.  Upon verification that the targets are red forces the battalion commander will halt the battalion’s movement towards the end of the range and transmit a call for fire to the artillery platoon leader.  The artillery platoon leader then transmits an order to the artillery platoon leader to fire on the red targets over the range.  The artillery platoon leader sends a message via the space-based relay to the forward observers indicating the incoming fire from the platoon.After the targets have been engaged the forward observers will send battle damage assessment (BDA) reports to the artillery platoon via the battalion commander.  When the battalion commander receives a BDA report indicating that the enemy forces have been neutralized the battalion commander will give the order for the battalion’s artillery units to cease fire and for the infantry units to continue on mission towards the end of the range.Figure 3. Scenario SHAPE  \* MERGEFORMAT 4.1.3 The Line of Sight Conclusions.  The Line of Sight vignette evaluates several factors:Detection of enemy units by forward observer platoon(s)Identification of enemy unitsHalting of advancement of blue forcesArtillery fire on red unitsBDA reports sent and received properlyRemobilization of friendly forces once enemy forces have been neutralizedA CES generates a data log capturing the messages relayed by the space-based communications relayNumber of Messages PassedNumber of Messages FailedScenario Mission ReportsNetwork Level Performance StatisticsInternal Federate Data LoggingConfigurable Metric Capture and DisplayMessage DelayRed LossesBlue LossesLoss Exchange RationThe simulation log files are analyzed to compare the above factors.  Based on the data, when the scenario was performed with space, more messages were received and there was a reduction in blue losses.  This illustrates the value of space based communications in a terrain challenged environment.Network Survivability VignetteThe network survivability scenario illustrates the importance space provides in mitigating the impact of electromagnetic environmental effects and electronic warfare on terrestrial networks.The functionality of the space communications effects simulation evaluates this by measuring the message completion rate, in an electronic warfare environment, of tactical messages created by OneSAF units that utilize a two tier, space and terrestrial, network versus a traditional single tier terrestrial network.4.2.1 Network Survivability OverviewThis vignette illustrates the use of space to reinforce a terrestrial network against electromagnetic environmental effects and electronic warfare.  Building upon the line of sight vignette, the network survivability vignette will utilize the same federate relationships with two modifications:  data link instead of voice messages is used and a message routing capability is added.  The network routes traffic based upon the health and status of the communications assets and their ability to provide a high quality of service.  The terrestrial links provide a lower latency service at a higher bit error rate while the satellite links provide a lower bit error rate with a higher latency.  The terrestrial network then experiences an attack via electromagnetic interference that increases the bit error rate of a terrestrial link until the link is completely degraded.  The interference then abruptly stops with the elimination of the EW threat.  Evaluation is based upon the message completion rate that should improve with the use of space communications as an alternative route.4.2.2 Network Survivability ScenarioThe vignette focuses on a division with four brigades’ combat teams, an aviation brigade, and a division support brigade, operating in a port city assembly area.  The four brigade combat teams are located in four city sectors, the aviation brigade has occupied the international airport, and the division support brigade is occupying the port and supporting a number of main supply routes.  The division is supporting tactical operations centers at the airport and the port.  The network for this vignette consists of the division and brigade tactical operations centers.  The network load consists of VoIP telephony, video teleconferencing, and data traffic.  The terrestrial network consists of 10m and 30m line of site transmission links.  The satellite network consists of 2.4m EHF ground terminals.The terrestrial network experiences an attack via electromagnetic interference against one then two critical data links that increases the bit error rate of a terrestrial link until the link is completely degraded.  The interference then abruptly stops with the elimination of the EW threat.  Evaluation is based upon the message completion rate that should improve with the use of space communications as an alternative route.4.2.3 Network Survivability ConclusionsThe Network Survivability vignette evaluates by several factors:Detection of a change in network quality of serviceIdentification of alternative communications pathsRe-routing of network trafficCES generates a data log capturing the messages relayed by the space-based communications relayNumber of Messages PassedNumber of Messages FailedNetwork Level Performance StatisticsInternal Federate Data LoggingConfigurable Metric Capture and DisplayMessage DelayThe simulation log files are analyzed to compare these factors.  Based on the data, the scenario shows that with space, more messages are received.  This illustrates the value of space based communications during an electronic warfare attack.4.3 Span of Control VignetteThe space span of control vignette shows a brigade combat team leaving an assembly area and conducting an offensive operation 100km north of the division assembly area.The functionality of the space communications effects simulation are evaluated by measuring the resources (equipment and time) required to maintain the span of control from brigade down to company/battery level when comparing a two tier, space and terrestrial, network versus a traditional single tier terrestrial network.4.3.1 Space Enhanced Span of Control OverviewConvoy operations are dangerous with troops and equipment often outside a maneuver control station’s communications range.  Space communications provides convoy commanders and maneuver control stations an ability to react quickly to enemy and environmental threats.  This vignette exercises a number of doctrinal steps in OneSAF to include convoy operations, react to an ambush, call for fire, and medevac requests.  CES impacts each action by bounding the execution to the capabilities of the communication systems.  The Space Server enables the space run with accurate space communications representations.4.3.2 Space Enhanced Span of Control ScenarioSixteen vehicles depart from the port assembly area and travel along a 100km main supply route to a tactical assembly area.  Midway, the convoy is ambushed.  The ambush initiates with an IED destroying the lead vehicle and RPGs disabling the trail vehicle.  The convoy element sends a situation report and a call for fire.  The convoy quick reaction force then secures the area and submits another situation report and a medavac request.4.3.3 Space Enhanced Span of Control ConclusionsThe Space Enhanced Span of Control vignette evaluates several performance measures of the following factors:Troop AttritionBattlefield DamageMessage CompletionTotal Number of Messages PassedTotal Number of Messages FailedCES generates a data log capturing the messages relayed by the space-based communications relayNetwork Level Performance StatisticsInternal Federate Data LoggingConfigurable Metric Capture and DisplayMessage DelayThe simulation log files compare these factors.  Based on the data, the scenario with space messages traffic is augmented, allowing more control over the forces.  This illustrates the value of space based communications for controlling forces.ConclusionsSummaryThese initial vignettes will demonstrate the value of satellite communications for space operations capability.  It also highlights the need to create a standard Space Communications Base Object Model (BOM) or to consider adding the specific space communications information to our current and more prevalent Real-Time Platform Reference (RPR)/MATRIX FOM.  A space BOM is representative of specific space-based capabilities and provides a common representation across new and existing federations.  Future WorkWork continues to evaluate the concept of a standard space communications object model to further measure and expand future requirements and functionality of space communications infrastructures and protocols, ensuring that this initial capability of the existing space communications capability is as robust as possible.  The roadmap includes plans to expand to Space Control, a representation of Gray (Neutral) and Red (Enemy) constellations to demonstrate anti-satellite techniques and their impact on the battlefield and design scenarios that demonstrate Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) benefits provided by space communications assets.  Space communications cannot be judged by network performance alone.  The use of space assets has significant impacts across DOTMLPF.  Once complete vignettes will be demonstrated over the Training and Doctrine Command’s (TRADOC) Battle Lab Collaborative Simulation Environment (BLCSE) to illustrate the value of space communications and demonstrate a simulation technique for incorporating space effects into distributed wargames with the potential for participation in TRADOC’s future experiments and use with a standard FOM.  This allows for the validation of tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) for the effect space based communications and improve the historically representation of communications currently modeled as either perfect or line of sight based and broadens the Terrestrial and airborne communications networks. The U.S. Army’s arsenal of models and simulations will the have a suite of tools to model the effects of terrestrial and space based communications have on the battlefield and, ultimately, the soldier.There is potential for immediate support and perspective from the Army space communications Command and Control, Communications, Computer and Intelligence (C4I) for the Joint services and to be incorporated into the BLCSE FOM.  This would provide TRADOC with a high-fidelity communications model for its simulated forces.  TRADOC would also gain a greater understanding of coordination amongst units during battle via CES data logs highlighting communications nodes that are both saturated and under utilized.  Relying on the existence of a common space data standard within the services for C2 and IO/ISR purposes provides an expanded approach to future requirements and functionality. The integration of FOMs and BOMs from various proponents will be interoperable throughout the modeling and simulation community.  6.
