Need to follow-up on tutorial on game technology2 Need to restart effort with study groups on game technology and on standards for M&S for Space exploration (cancelled because of NASA inability to participate & ODU having to leave early)3 SCF remains interested  in increasing emphasis on partnering opportunities for M&S for complex distributed systems Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)17Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)30Peak attendance (including joint sessions)-Total papers presented3“No-show” presentations2 unable to present *Other presentations and panel discussions3Recommended Reading List nomination: 09S-SIW-059               2009 SPRING - OUTBRIEF
