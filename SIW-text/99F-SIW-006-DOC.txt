One reason for consideration of using Information Modeling as an integral part of the FEDEP for C4I federations is that current C4ISR interfaces for M&S are hindered due to the lack of standards which would support alignment of the High Level Architecture (HLA) with the Joint Technical Architecture (JTA).  While the M&S community is standardizing on emerging HLA approaches, the C4ISR community is moving to standardize on the JTA and the Defense Information Infrastructure Common Operating Environment (DII COE).  The implications are that standardization, occurring within both communities can help to facilitate C4I-to-simulation interfaces if standards that align these two domains are developed.  Accordingly, the paper investigates the utility of information modeling as a useful approach for metamodeling the processes of a Federation and the utility of information modeling information standards, which define a logical view of data (meaning and contextual use) within an architecture, in supporting the linkage between the simulation domain and the real-world domain.1.0  Background1.1  Information Modeling ObjectivesDuring Fiscal Year 1999, Atlantic Consulting Services (ACS), Incorporated had a Small Business Innovation Research Phase II contract sponsored by the U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM), to further develop a High Level Architecture (HLA) C4I Federation Object Model (FOM) [1] using the Federation Development Process (FEDEP) [2].  Under a subcontract to ACS, Monmouth Science and Technology, Incorporated, has developed an approach for using information modeling to:Support the FEDEP for C4I federations, andSupport the interfacing of real C4I 	systems to simulations.This report documents this work.  A review of previous work done on interfacing of real C4I systems to simulations is given in the Implementation Study Group for C4I-to-Simulation Interfaces (ISG-C4I) preliminary report [3].1.2  The Federation Development ProcessThe FEDEP is an evolving process based on experiences from development of HLA protofederations and subsequent federations.  The basic FEDEP is comprised of the following five steps:1.  Requirements Definition2.  Conceptual Model Development3.  Federation Design4.  Federation Integration and Test5.  Federation Execution and AnalysisThe Conceptual Model Development phase of the FEDEP involves conceptual analysis, including development of a simulation-independent representation of the real world domain (the Conceptual Model of the Mission Space (CMMS) [4]), and development of federation scenarios.  In our approach, information modeling is used to help bridge the gap between the Conceptual Model Development and the object model development of the Federation Design steps of the FEDEP. 1.3  Justification for Information Modeling as part of Conceptual Model DevelopmentBecause real C4I systems are described in detail by information models, we develop a high-level CMMS of the C4I mission space and leave the detailed representations to an information model.  Further justification for this approach is given in a papers by Hieb and Staver [5] and Flournoy [6].  They note that current C4ISR interfaces for M&S are hindered due to the fact that different architectures were chosen by the C2 and M&S communities.  While the M&S community is standardizing on emerging HLA approaches, the C4I community is standardizing on the JTA [7] and the Defense Information Infrastructure Common Operating Environment (DII COE).  Flournoy discusses the implications of the migrations to DII COE and HLA on C2-to-simulation interoperability and notes that standardization, occurring within both communities, suggests that the number of C2-to-simulation interface needs can be reduced to a handful of connection solutions at the infrastructure level.2.0  Conceptual Analysis2.1  Conceptual Model of the Mission SpaceFor the purposes of this paper we will restrict our discussion to the Battalion and Below (B2) Tactical Internet (TI).  Following the CMMS Technical Framework [4], our CMMS domain description includes a description of Entities, Actions, Tasks, and Interactions (EATI) which constitute the TI and its use.  Entities include the components of the TI and PERSONs and equipment that use the TI.  Actions include tasks generated by Command and Control (C2).  Interactions include non-persistent things like messages, which for the TI can include C2 and Situation Awareness (SA) data.entity is defined to include the notions of person, organization, facility, feature, materiel, and plans.Examples of entity types include:entity		Examplesactor		Commander, Platoon, EPLRSfacility	TOC, OPFACfeature		hill, bridge, river, roadmateriel	Radio, Internet Controllerplan		criteria for generating SAinformation	Messagenetwork	Tactical InternetExamples of a task include:actor		action (verb + entity)Commander	Generates Tasking OrderEPLRS		Generates SA messageinteractions support the flow of information among events, state, entities, actions, or tasks.

Activity models are representations of the mission area applications or activities that must be performed to achieve a mission.  Data models are used as a logical basis for physical data exchange and shared data structures, including message formats and schema for shared databases.  Our purpose is to use activity models to depict the mission area function to a level of detail sufficient to identify each entity in the data model that is involved in an activity.  We feel that Information Models will be indispensable in Federation Object Model (FOM) and Simulation Object Model (SOM) development, and that they will provide the linkage between the simulation domain and the real-world domain.3.2  Information Modeling StandardsAttendant to Information Models are information standards which define a logical view of data (meaning and contextual use) within an architecture.  The mandated standard for activity modeling is FIPS PUB 183 [8].  Mandates for standard data modeling are given in DoD Manual 8320 [9] and FIPS PUB 184 [10].  Mandated standards for DoD Data Definitions are given by [10] and Defense Data Dictionary System (DDDS) and the Secure Intelligence Data Repository (SIDR).  The emerging standards for data modeling are Integrated (Computer-Aided Manufacturing) Definition (IDEF), Conceptual Schema Modeling and the Unified Modeling Language (UML) which accommodate object-oriented methods (OOM).In this section, we develop information models of the armor battalion entities described in the CMMS using a modeling methodology based on the IDEF.  In IDEF0, schematics are developed wherein boxes represent activities or processes that relate to other processes by arrows.  These arrows and boxes are called ICOMs.  The arrows enter and leave boxes by the following convention:Inputs to a process enter the left side of boxControls (plans, standard operating 	procedures, or directives) enter the topMechanisms, used to conduct the 	process, enter the bottomOutputs leave from the rightFor object modeling, the box ICOMs represent objects and their activities, and the arrow ICOMs represent interactions.  We show IDEF0 diagrams for two basic real-world processes that are involved in battalion and below C2 and SA messaging.  These are Radio Frequency (RF) propagation and the internet process.  Figure 3.1 is an activity diagram for the real-world radio frequency propagation process.  RF messages all propagate through the atmosphere and over terrain.  Considering RF propagation as a process, the controls include atmospheric effects (including absorption) and terrain effects (including blockage and multiple reflections).  Output from the process include direct rays which have only suffered absorption, and indirect rays which have been scattered by terrain.  For a given receiver, some transmitted rays will be blocked by the terrain or other objects and not be output from the RF propagation process.  On the receiving end, incident rays at the receiver antenna include the transmitted message of concern, other transmitted messages (friendly interference) and jammer signals.  These processes must all be modeled and represented in the C4I FOM.  The ENTITYs are:  Radio Frequency Transmitter and Radio Frequency Receiver;  and Terrain and Atmosphere.  The ACTION is Transmit Message.  The INTERACTION is the RF signal delivering the message.The real-world internet routing process is shown in Figure 3.2.  C2 or SA messages are initiated by a C2 device and routed by an EPLRS radio.  The local radio is in constant communication with other radios in the network to determine link status.  Link status is determined by range effects, terrain losses, and network load.  The local radio chooses a link transmission based on a “cost” budget and the message is transmitted when the link becomes available.  Once sent, the transmitted message propagates according to the RF propagation process.  The link between the tactical internet and the Bn TOC is from Company Command and Control (C2) devices to the Bn TOC through EPLRS.  Situation Awareness (SA) information transport, on Bn and Below  C2 and SA (B2) entities, through the TI to the Bn TOC will be supported.The activity models represent and identify functionality required of C2 and SA activities that an armor battalion must perform to achieve its mission, and depict the mission area function to a level of detail sufficient to identify each entity in the data models that are involved in the activity and so form the basis for data model and interface model development or refinement.3.3  Standard Data Models3.3.1  The C2CDMStandard approaches to data modeling have been developed by the DoD:The DoD Data Model (DDM) is a department-wide logical data model which provides the standard definition and use of specific data elements to the developers of all DoD systemsThe Command and Control (C2) Core Data Model (C2CDM) is a subset of the DDM.The DDM and C2CDM serve as logical database schema defining the names, representations, and relations of data within DoD systems.  The result of using the C2CDM will be a detailed model of the entire C4I system of systems and its processes.  These data representations will ultimately specify information that must be represented in SOMs and FOMs.For a C2 Headquarters staff responsible for battlefield operations, there are five primary battlefield entities of interest:   FACILITY, FEATURE, MATERIEL, ORGANIZATION, PERSON.  Each of these primary entities has a TYPE.  The Company entity name is UNIT and corresponds to a UNIT-LEVEL and a UNIT-TYPE.  The Company has ORGANIZATION-TYPE echelon code “Co-Company”.  The Company commander is a PERSON with PERSON IDENTIFIER attributes:  PERSON-NAME;  PERSON-UNIFORMED-SERVICE-RANK.  The Company Commander receives OPORDs from the Bn TOC.  The Company Commander may use GUIDANCE based on higher- echelon STRATEGY to develop his  PLAN.There are also ASSOCIATION relationships that are attached to each primary entityASSOCIATION type code attributes are used to classify the specific types of associations that are allowed, such as  ORGANIZATION-ASSOCIATION type code.Selected non-telecommunications C2CDM entities are shown in Table 3.1.  We will have ORGANIZATION-TYPEs:  Battalion, Company, Platoon with ORGANIZATION-ASSOCIATIONs between them.  There will also be associations among ORGANIZATIONs, PERSONs, and NETWORKs.  We define a Tactical Operations Center (TOC) as a FACILITY, so that a battalion TOC has a FACILITY-PERSON association with the battalion commander, and a FACILITY-TYPE echelon code:  "Battalion".Selected telecommunications C2CDM entities are shown in Table 3.2.  The most general level shown is TELECOMMUNICATIONS-NETWORK-ELEMENT, however the C2CDM also separates TELECOMMUNICATIONS-NETWORK-DEVICE from TELECOMMUNICATIONS-NETWORK-ELEMENTS.  Thus, we associate INC with TELECOMMUNICATIONS-NETWORK-DEVICE.  The remainder of the table defines network entities that we will need in our Information Model.  In particular, we associate our Bn TOC with TELECOMMUNICATIONS- NETWORK-ELEMENT-NODE, which is defined as a group of signal operational facilities, including at least one telecommunications network device where management and control can be exerted.Figure 3.2 Real-World RF Propagation ProcessFigure 2.4  Real-World RoutingENTITYENTITY DEFINITIONORGANIZATIONAdministrative structure with a missionORGANIZATION-ASSOCIATIONAn ASSOCIATION of an ORGANIZATION with another ORGANIZATION.ORGANIZATION-FACILITYAn association between an ORGANIZATION and a FACILITY.ORGANIZATION-PERSONA relationship of a specific ORGANIZATION with a specific PERSON.FACILITYReal property, having a specified use, that is built or maintained by peopleFACILITY-PERSONThe association of a specific facility with a specific person.PERSONPersonPERSON-UNIFORMED- SERVICE-RANKA uniformed-service-rank held by …PERSON-ORGANIZATIONAn association between a person and an organizationTable 3.1  Selected C2CDM non-Telecommunications Entity DefinitionsNETWORKThe joining of two or more components for the purpose of exchanging verbal, non-verbal, or electronic communications or transporting personnel, equipment, or other resources.NETWORK-CHANNELThe connection between two NETWORK-NODES (a transmission facility)  with a defined bandwidthTELECOMMUNICATIONS- NETWORK-ELEMENTA COMPONENT OF A TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORK.TELECOMMUNICATIONS- NETWORK-DEVICEA MATERIEL-ITEM THAT INTERFACES WITH A TELECOMMUNICATIONS-NETWORK-ELEMENTTELECOMMUNICATIONS- NETWORK-ELEMENT–NETWORK-DEVICETHE ASSOCIATION OF A SPECIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS-NETWORK-DEVICE WITH A SPECIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS-NETWORK-ELEMENTTELECOMMUNICATIONS- NETWORK-ELEMENT- NETWORKA SET OF INTEROPERATING COMPONENTS EXCHANGING INFORMATIONTELECOMMUNICATIONS- NETWORK-ELEMENT- CHANNELA SPECIFIED MODULATION SCHEME FOR THE TRANSMISSION AND RECEPTION OF ELECTRO MAGNETIC SIGNALSTELECOMMUNICATIONS- NETWORK-ELEMENT- LINKA SINGLE ELECTROMAGNETIC CONNECTION THAT PROVIDES TELECOMMUNICATIONSTELECOMMUNICATIONS- NETWORK-ELEMENT- LINK-RADIOA WIRELESS ELECTROMAGNETIC CONNECTION, IN THE RADIO FREQUENCY RANGE, THAT PROVIDES TELECOMMUNICATIONSTable 3.2  C2CDM Telecommunications Entity Definitions3.4  Entity-Relationship ModelingWe use the IDEF1X-compliant Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) tool, ERwin [11] to describe system information for major entities.  A Bn ERD is shown in Figure 3.2.  Entities are represented by boxes labeled by  the entity name, and divided by a line that separates attributes into key and non-key attributes. Entity Relationships are show by a line drawn between the entities.  A heavy “dot” at one end of the relationship lines indicates a one-to-many relationship.  A heavy “dot” at both ends of the relationship line indicates a many-to-many relationship.  Entity relationships are further defined by the use of foreign keys (FK) which are defined as primary key attributes of a parent entity, contributed to a child entity.Figure 3.3 ERD for Armor BattalionEach ORGANIZATION has a PERSON associated with it.

The tactical internet itself is a TELECOMMUNICATIONS-NETWORK-ELEMENT-NETWORK.4.0 C4I Databases and Object Model DevelopmentThe follow-on to the development of the Information Models is the development of SOMs and FOMs based on the entities, data elements, and interrelationships documented in the IMMS.  However, if the simulation model does not have reasonable representations of critical C4I data, all will be for naught.  Hieb and Blalock [12] note that there are three areas that must be addressed to achieve “seamless” simulation to C4I interfaces.  The first area is interface standards, the second area is common software components, and the third area is alignment of data models.  The latter two can be addressed with the development of new models, or the restructuring of legacy models.  If however, a simulation does not have C4I common software and an aligned data model, then a severe interfacing challenge is at hand.It is the opinion here, that an aligning interface between a non-aligned simulation and real systems will serve at best as a stop-gap measure, and we agree with Timian et al, [13] who maintain that the goals of C4I-to-simulation interoperability can only be achieved by defining a set of standards that apply to both the Army’s C4I systems and to its simulations, and that the key to common, reusable M&S C4I interfaces is the Joint Common Data Base (JCDB).  They have suggested that the simulation world adopt the JCDB, which the Army is using as a common data base in the Army Battle Command Systems (ABCS), as a data standard.  The JCDB conforms to the C2CDM and focuses on data which is shared by two or more Army Battle Command Systems (ABCS).  The JCDB is comprised of several different components, including:JCDB Transformation Data ModelJoint Data DictionarySubscribe and ReceiveJCDB APIsThe JCDB is therefore particularly well suited to support the development of HLA object models and could be used as the basis for identifying the data exchange requirements for interfaces between Army tactical C4I systems and simulations.  For this approach to be effective, Simulation Object Models (SOM) must represent, with reasonable fidelity, the critical data elements that are 1) used to initialize the JCDB; and 2) sent between the simulations and C4I systems. 5.0 Summary and ConclusionsWe are using information modeling to help bridge the gap between the Conceptual Model Development and the object model development of the Federation Design steps of the FEDEP. The approach involves developing a high-level CMMS of the C4I mission space which includes a description of Entities, Actions, Tasks, and Interactions (EATI) that support the TI and developing detailed representations of the real world in an information model.  The information modeling includes IDEF0 descriptions of the real-world activities and use of the IDEF1X-compliant Entity-Relationship Diagram tool, ERwin, to describe system data for major entities.  The follow-on to the development of these information models is the development of object models such as a Tactical Internet Model [14] SOM and the continuing development of the C4I FOM based on the entities, data elements, and interrelationships documented in the IMMS.  However, we support the concept that the goals of seamless C4I-to-simulation interoperability can only be achieved by defining a set of standards that apply to both the Army’s C4I systems and to its simulations, and that the key to common, reusable M&S C4I interfaces is the Joint Common Data Base (JCDB). 6.0 REFERENCES[1] Sudnikovich, W., Roberts, J., Lacetera, J., Implementation of  a Prototype C4I FOM, Simulation Interoperability Workshop Paper 99S-SIW-061[2] High Level Architecture Federation Development and Execution (FEDEP) Model Version 1.3 DRAFT, 9 December 1998, Defense Modeling and Simulation Office[3]  Lacetera, J., ISG-C4I Preliminary Report, Simulation Interoperability Workshop Paper 99F-SIW-007[4]  CMMS Technical Framework, DMSO Web Page[5]  Hieb,M.,  Staver, M., The Army’s Approach to Modeling and Simulation Standards For C4I Interfaces, , Simulation Interoperability Workshop paper 98F-SIW-259[6]  Doug Flournoy, Reconciling Emerging Infrastructure Standards to Promote C2-to-Simulation Interoperability, 98F-SIW-027[7]  Joint Technical Architecture Version 2.0, 26 May 1998[8]  FIPS PUB 183, Integration Definition for Function Modeling (IDEFO), December 1993.[9]  DoD Manual 8320.1-M-1, DoD Data Standardization Procedures, April 1998[10]  FIPS PUB 184, Integration Definition For Information Modeling (IDEFIX), December 1993.[11]  ERwin, 1998 Platinum Technology Incorporated, www.platinum.com[12] Hieb, M. and Blalock, J., Data Alignment between Army C4I Databases and Army Simulations, Simulation Interoperability Workshop paper 99S-SIW-034[13] Timian, D., Hieb, M., Glass, J., Staver, M, Using Standard Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) Components to Interface to Simulations, Simulation Interoperability Workshop paper 99S-SIW-035[14] Manoski, S., McConnell, J, Riehl, M, Tafoni, T, Vogel, J, (1997), The Tactical Internet Model Provides Realistic Communications For Task Force XXI Training, Spring ‘97 Simulation Interoperability Workshop, Paper No. 97F-SIW-033Author BiographyJoseph Lacetera has been president of Monmouth Science and Technology, Incorporated (MSTI) since March of 1998.
