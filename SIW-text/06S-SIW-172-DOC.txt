Logistics and enterprise models need representative consumer, competitor, and other “stakeholder/influencer” behavior. And logistics and other enterprise models often address modeling these behaviors in ways that may transfer to other agent and micro-entity level models.Following from the above, we had several discussions in this forum session about the appropriateness of deterministic simulation models of processes and work flows. A number of attendees expressed concern that deterministic simulations of enterprise processes may represent bad practice, and that stochastic simulations should be favored. This practice issue may warrant follow-on discussion and possible action along the lines of a study group for enterprise modeling best practice, potentially leading to an enterprise modeling best practices product.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)12Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)40Peak attendance (including joint sessions)50Total papers presented12“No-show” presentations0Other presentations and panel discussions1Recommended Reading List nomination: 045, 085 (change based on presentation)                 2006 SPRING SIW OUTBRIEF FORM
