The Australian Defence Science and Technology Organisation has developed the JOint Air Navy Networking Environment (JOANNE) Project that will provide the technical architecture to link these assets into a synthetic environment for ADF training. Standards are essential for establishing interoperability among the ADF’s training simulators. Three types of standards – international, de facto, and local, have been identified. International standards are set by organisations such as the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) and the Simulation Interoperability Standards Organisation (SISO); de facto standards are standards which have been proven reliable through laboratory experience or experimentation by industry; and finally local standards refer to standards developed within the Australian Defence Community that are required to achieve interoperability. The proposed set of JOANNE standards includes areas of simulator networking, exercise management, voice/radio communications, terrain database and model development, scenario development, and wide area network interoperability. IntroductionThe Australian Defence Force (ADF) is developing a suite of sophisticated training simulators for its major air, maritime, and land assets, many of which will have the capability of being networked together via Advanced Distributed Simulation.The Australian Defence Science & Technology Organisation (DSTO) has initiated the JOint Air Navy Networking Environment (JOANNE) Project that will provide the technical architecture to link these assets into a synthetic environment for ADF training. JOANNE will also provide guidance on the standards required to achieve the required level of interoperability [ seq references ryan_etal_dsto_tr_1300_2002  \* MERGEFORMAT 1]. Standards are essential for achieving interoperability among the ADF’s training simulators.This paper describes the standards recommended for ADF training simulators to be networked into successful, Joint and Coalition synthetic training environments.BackgroundExisting network-enabled training simulation assets within Australia include the Royal Australian Navy’s (RAN) Maritime Warfare Training System (MWTS) simulators [ seq references marshall_simtect98 \* MERGEFORMAT 2] and the Royal Australian Air Force’s (RAAF) AP-3C training simulators. Other simulators which may be networked in the future include those for the Seasprite, Blackhawk, and Armed Reconnaissance helicopters, together with the AEW&C and Collins Class submarine. On Board Training Systems being acquired for the FFG class could also be networked for enhanced training opportunities.International connectivity is also being achieved via the Coalition Readiness Management System (CReaMS) Project Arrangement with the US. Issues of interoperability, commonality of databases, and latency are being researched in a synthetic environment via an international Wide Area Network (WAN) between Australian simulation systems and the US Battle Force Tactical Training (BFTT) Program [ seq references pms430 \* MERGEFORMAT 3]. A successful demonstration was achieved at the I/ITSEC 2001 Conference linking USN systems on the conference floor with RAN systems at HMAS WATSON in Sydney [ seq references creams_pie \* MERGEFORMAT 4], and a further classified exercise was carried out in February, 2003.Standards Development PhilosophyStandards are essential for establishing interoperability and reuse among the ADF’s training simulators. In the JOANNE Project, three types of standards – international, de facto, and local, can be defined as discussed below.International StandardsInternational standards are those defined by the leading international organisations developing the relevant standards for simulation.The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) is the leading authority in many technical areas, supporting over 900 active standards with 700 under development [ seq references ieee \* MERGEFORMAT 5]. IEEE standards have ‘gold’ status, being regarded as authoritative. However, since development of IEEE standards can be a slow process, other options are frequently explored.The Simulation Interoperability Standards Organisation (SISO) is an industry consortium [ seq references siso \* MERGEFORMAT 6] that focusses on facilitating simulation interoperability and component reuse across the simulation community. SISO is actively developing and issuing standards for simulation interoperability and this process is proving a useful alternative to IEEE certification.Other standards organisations interested in simulation include:The Geneva-based International Standards Organisation (ISO –  HYPERLINK "http://www.iso.ch/" http://www.iso.ch/) which is responsible for over 13000 international standards,the American National Standards Institute (ANSI,  HYPERLINK "http://ansi.org/" http://ansi.org/),the US Department of Defense which has its own standardisation process that must be followed for adoption of new technologies and practices, andNATO that, as part of its charter, defines standards for military interoperability.De Facto StandardsWhere appropriate IEEE or SISO standards do not exist, de facto standards are often required. These may relate to recommendations for use of a specific Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) system, a set of agreed procedures that has been proven reliable through industrial or laboratory experience, or a data set (for example, a terrain database) that is freely available and can be considered a standard.Local StandardsLocal standards refer to standards developed within the Australian Defence Community. These may include agreed lists of entities that can be supported by ADF simulators, or sets of terrain databases that can be implemented in simulators employing visual systems.Networking Standards for InteroperabilityThe most commonly used methods of carrying out ADS exercises specify the use of either Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) or High Level Architecture (HLA). DIS is the current mature standard for simulation interoperability with over 10 years of development whereas HLA is a potential replacement.Distributed Interactive SimulationDIS is a networking protocol standard that provides a method of communicating entity information among simulators through Protocol Data Units (PDUs) to create a synthetic environment. These PDUs comprise data packets that are broadcast over the simulation network. DIS PDU Standards were developed under the guidance of the DIS Coordinating Committee, and utilised the IEEE Standards approval process [ seq references dis_vision \* MERGEFORMAT 7].Critical Issues with DISThe critical issues with DIS implementation are:The version of DIS to use and the set of PDUs that are supportedOptions for non-standard PDUsImplementation of correct enumerationsDIS VV&A OptionsDIS VersionsDIS has undergone the IEEE standardisation process three times:IEEE 1278-1993 (1993) [ seq references ieee_1278_1993 \* MERGEFORMAT 8]: 10 PDUs supporting entity appearance and movement, weapons firing, ordnance detonation, collisions, and logistics;IEEE 1278.1-1995 (1995) [ seq references ieee_1278_1_1995 \* MERGEFORMAT 9]: 27 PDUs with additional support for radio communications, simulation management, electronic warfare and laser interactions for smart munitions; andIEEE 1278.1a-1998 (1998) [ seq references ieee_1278_1_a_1998 \* MERGEFORMAT 10]: 67 PDUs with additional support for emissions, entity information/interaction/management, underwater and mine warfare, field instrumentation, communications and environment. There are also various draft versions – for example, DIS 2.04 was the draft which evolved into IEEE 1278.1, and DIS 2.14 the draft for the IEEE 1278.1a-1998 standard. DIS versions are designated by a number, as given in  REF _Ref37221559 \h  \* MERGEFORMAT Table 1.Table  SEQ Table \* ARABIC 1: Versions of DIS1DIS version 1.0 (May 92)2IEEE 1278-19933DIS version 2.0 - third draft (May 93)4DIS PDU version 2.0 – 4th draft (March 1994)5IEEE 1278.1-19956IEEE 1278.1A-1998With each revision, the approach has generally been to add additional capability via new PDUs with minimal changes to existing PDU structures.Non-standard DIS PDUsDue to delays in the IEEE standardisation process, projects such as BFTT and the AP-3C have developed their own PDUs. For example, BFTT has its own Chaff and Environment PDUs that have different structures from the IEEE standards. For full interoperability with other systems, it is recommended that these be converted to the IEEE standards where possible.Local Standards for DIS UseThe current DIS standard is incomplete and open to interpretation in some areas [ seq references spithill_etal_simtect2002 \* MERGEFORMAT 11]. During development of the I/ITSEC 2001 demonstration [ seq references creams_pie \* MERGEFORMAT 4], issues arose in various areas which required resolution. Solutions have been developed which can be considered as local standards:The Electromagnetic Emission PDU has no field to indicate if an emitter has been turned off – either the frequency or power can be set to zero, or the system can simply time out. The recommended solution is to treat power as the primary method of indicating that the emitter has stopped radiating.The standard is unclear as to whether heartbeat PDUs should be sent for emitters, radios, and other attached equipment. The solution adopted is to send heartbeats with a period set to a multiple of the associated platform’s heartbeat rate.Implementation of fire, chaff, and detonation events required resolution to ensure consistent interpretation in different legacy simulators.The IEEE 1278.1a standard defines an IFF/NAVAIDS/ATC PDU. While the latest version of the IEEE enumerations has the correct values for modes, it should be noted that some of the earlier documentation contained errors.DIS EnumerationsDIS provides a standard set of enumerations for entities and also for weapons, sensors, communication devices, environmental descriptors and other attributes. This is a highly comprehensive set that includes virtually the entire current US and former Soviet inventories, as well as those of other major nations such as Germany, France and the UK. Compliance with these enumerations is mandatory for participation in a DIS exercise. The DIS enumerations listings are maintained through SISO [ seq references siso \* MERGEFORMAT 6].In addition to the development of non-standard PDUs, non-standard enumerations also exist. The BFTT Project, for example, has developed its own extensive set of enumerations similar, but not identical, to the SISO set.DIS VV&AThe DIS Test Suite (DTS) is a tool developed by the US Army’s Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation Command (STRICOM) to test DIS compliance of simulations and simulators prior to participation in DIS exercises, in an internationally accredited automated environment [ seq references mcauliffe_etal_96_14_081 \* MERGEFORMAT 12]. The system has been used for testing simulators participating in the Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation and Education Conferences (I/ITSEC –  HYPERLINK "http://www.iitsec.org/" http://www.iitsec.org/).The DIS Test Suite has been further developed under contract by Australia and used for accrediting DIS interfaces on ADF simulators.JOANNE Recommendations for DISFor future interoperability with other ADF simulators, JOANNE standards recommend adherence to the latest IEEE 1278.1A-1998 standard [ seq references ieee_1278_1_a_1998 \* MERGEFORMAT 10].JOANNE standards further recommend that the DIS version number (ie 4 - 2.0.4, 5 - IEEE 1278.1 or 6 - DIS 2.1.4 / 1278.1A) should be determined at load time, namely via a variable in a configuration file read when the simulator is started up. If there is only one DIS version available it should be 2.1.4 / 1278.1A (version 6 in the PDU data fields). Unless this occurs, interoperability problems are likely during participation in a DIS exercise with other simulators using different versions of DIS.JOANNE standards recommend that the local solutions for attached parts and radars should be generally adopted by the ADF.JOANNE standards also recommend that the standard SISO set of enumerations be used to prevent ambiguity. High Level ArchitectureHLA is a methodology designed to support distributed simulation exercises [ seq references hla_dmso \* MERGEFORMAT 13]. It is defined by the rules that specify how simulations (federates) interact and the Run Time Infrastructure (RTI) which provides the means to exchange data during execution.Each set of participating federates, or federation, requires a Federation Object Model (FOM) identifying the attributes and interactions supported by the federation. Federates send information through the RTI which in turn distributes the information to the other federates. However, the RTI does not specify the exact byte layout of data sent across the network as in DIS. For federates to be interoperable within a federation, they must all be able to subscribe and publish to the same FOM and use the same RTI.HLA StandardsElements of HLA have been standardised under the IEEE standardisation process [ seq references ieee_hla \* MERGEFORMAT 14]. 1516-2000 IEEE Standard for Modeling and Simulation (M&S) High Level Architecture - Framework and Rules1516.1-2000 IEEE Standard for Modeling and Simulation (M&S) High Level Architecture - Federate Interface Specification 1516.2-2000 IEEE Standard for Modeling and Simulation (M&S) High Level Architecture - Object Model Template (OMT) Specification Since 1998, a de facto standard for HLA, version 1.3, has existed for use within the US Department of Defense (DoD). Versions 1.3 and IEEE 1516 have different Application Programmer Interfaces (APIs). This de facto version and the newer IEEE 1516 set of standards will need to coexist with HLA 1.3 being used as the US DoD standard and IEEE 1516 being adopted as a non-governmental standard for DoD use [ seq references hla_standards_pz \* MERGEFORMAT 15].Use of Reference FOMsVarious reference FOMs have been proposed to assist with conversion of DIS-compatible systems to HLA and to further promote interoperability.The Real-time Platform Reference (RPR) FOM is an HLA description of the DIS protocols [ seq references shanks_97s_siw \* MERGEFORMAT 16]. There are three version either developed or in development:RPR-FOM 1.0 supporting DIS IEEE-1278.1-1995 functionality [ seq references ieee_1278_1_1995 \* MERGEFORMAT 9] was released as a SISO standard in 1999 [ seq references siso \* MERGEFORMAT 6].RPR FOM 2.0, under development since 1999, considerably extends RPR-FOM 1.0 with the aim of supporting DIS IEEE 1278.1a-1998 functionality [ seq references ieee_1278_1_a_1998 \* MERGEFORMAT 10], including features such as environmental representation and underwater warfare. Standardisation of RPR FOM 2.0 should occur in 2003.RPR FOM 3.0 will follow on from RPR FOM 2.0 and may offer improvements over DIS because of its enhanced architecture and implementation of HLA-specific features.The US Naval Training Meta FOM (NTMF) is being developed to achieve meaningful interoperability with US Navy and Marine Corps legacy and new training systems under HLA [ seq references kassal_etal_simtect2001 \* MERGEFORMAT 17]. The NTMF extends RPR FOM 2.0, and adds additional functionality to incorporate realistic environmental data for use in simulations. Versions of Run Time InfrastructureDMSO provided the RTI free to registered users until September, 2002. The initial versions of the RTI were government developed whilst the latest version, RTI 1.3 NG, is industry developed. Other industry-developed RTIs exist including those of MäK (US) [ seq references mak \* MERGEFORMAT 18] and Pitch (Sweden) [ seq references pitch \* MERGEFORMAT 19].These early versions of RTI all conform to the HLA 1.3 de facto standard. With the IEEE 1516-2000 set of standards, there is a need to develop RTIs conforming to this new standard. Pitch has also announced an RTI for IEEE 1516 [ seq references pitch \* MERGEFORMAT 19].Migration Paths from DIS to HLAIncreasing demands are being put on DIS-compliant simulators to upgrade to HLA since HLA provides additional functionality to DIS. HLA compliance can occur via various approaches: a gateway, middleware or a native HLA integration. Each approach has associated costs and risks. These approaches are discussed in detail elsewhere [ seq references ryan_etal_simtect99 \* MERGEFORMAT 20].JOANNE Recommendations for HLAJOANNE standards recommend the use of the RPR-FOM 2 as the baseline FOM for interoperability. This FOM is strongly supported by SISO and most COTS middleware solutions have adopted, or are adopting, the RPR FOM series. The NTMF, an extension of the RPR-FOM, may also become a viable option after further development.The choice of an RTI is important, though less critical than that of the FOM, since all federates in a federation have to use the same RTI. Furthermore, the RTI can be switched without re-compilation of a simulation. The RTIs available both from DMSO and commercial vendors need to be assessed for each federation.To facilitate migration from DIS to HLA, the middleware option is recommended to provide the greatest flexibility whilst also maintaining backward compatibility with DIS.Exercise Management StandardsRecommended Site Identification Numbers (IDs) for Australian SystemsDIS exercises identify sites via a 16-bit unsigned integer. This means that each site is identified by a number in the range: 0 - 65535. With various ADF training simulation systems under development, there is a need to define IDs for different sites. These numbers will be used in the DIS gateways at the various systems. The US Navy has already assigned numbers in the range 57 – 2504 to uniquely identify shore and ship-based simulators.In DIS each country is uniquely identified by a number. Since 13 is the DIS country identifier for Australia, it is recommended that Australia uses numbers in the range 13000 - 13999 for DIS exercises as follows:RAN		13000 - 13199RAAF		13200 - 13399Army		13400 – 13599Joint		13600 - 13700DSTO		13700 - 13799Industry etc	13800 - 13999Each Service thus has effectively 200 site IDs which should be more than sufficient. The full standards report contains recommendations for Navy shore sites and ships, as well as RAAF bases and DSTO and industry sites [ seq references joanne_standards_report  \* MERGEFORMAT 21].Entity SetsJOANNE has identified a set of entities that need to be recognized by any simulator wishing to participate in a JOANNE networking exercise [ seq references joanne_standards_report \* MERGEFORMAT 21]. This set, compiled from data provided by several projects, is designed to give Australian Defence Advanced Distributed Simulation projects a recommended starting list of entities. If possible, 3D visual models of these entities (in Multigen OpenFlight format) will also be made available.Video Teleconferencing RecommendationsVideo Teleconferencing is invaluable as a tool to build distributed teams and to assist in more accurate, meaningful dialogue between teams during scenario pre-brief and debriefing. For the I/ITSEC 2001 CReaMS demonstration, a Polycom Viewstation MP system ( HYPERLINK "http://www.polycom.com/home/" http://www.polycom.com/home/) was installed at all sites and used for the training event [ seq references creams_pie \* MERGEFORMAT 4]. The video average traffic rate was limited to 400 kb/sec, with a peak burst rate limited to 600 kb/sec.Interoperability of Voice/Radio Communication SystemsVoice CommunicationsVoice communications can be achieved in DIS using either proprietary or COTS systems as described below.BFTT Digitised VoiceBFTT uses a proprietary DIS voice system which includes some non-standard parameters [ seq references spithill_etal_simtect2002 \* MERGEFORMAT 11]. Care must be taken when interfacing DIS-compliant radio systems with BFTT equipment.COTS SolutionsCompanies such as Advanced Simulation Technology Inc. (ASTi) can provide voice radio capability for ADS exercises [ seq references asti \* MERGEFORMAT 22]. Any DIS/HLA application entity can attach to a DIS/HLA radio operator by sending the appropriate network packet to the ASTI equipment. The radio equipment then picks up the entity position information from the entity’s Entity State PDUs in order to calculate any special effects required, such as curvature of the Earth modelling, and terrain occulting effects.ASTi has been commonly used for DIS voice communications. However, it does not fully implement the latest version of DIS which includes Intercom PDUs, but rather uses a proprietary solution for intercom based on the IEEE 1278.1-1995 PDUs [ seq references spithill_etal_simtect2002  \* MERGEFORMAT 11].Tactical Data Link IssuesThe use of Tactical Data Link (TDL) in a synthetic environment can considerably enhance its tactical training fidelity. Options for employing tactical data link within a simulation environment include:live link, where each simulator’s tactical picture is converted to real Link messages (from the DIS interface), andsimulated link, where either (a) the link functionality is emulated from existing DIS/HLA packets or (b) link data is embedded into DIS/HLA packetsLive Link using COTS SystemsDIS simulation data can be converted into real data link messages using commercial systems available from companies including Northrop Grumman ( HYPERLINK "http://www.northropgrummanit.com/" http://www.northropgrummanit.com/) and AAI ( HYPERLINK "http://www.aaicorp.com/" http://www.aaicorp.com/). These systems can translate PDUs into M-series Link 11 messages and vice versa. When a simulator generates an Entity State PDU, an appropriate M-series message to update the vehicle track will be generated.Simulated Link in DISStandard Transmitter and Signal DIS PDUs can also support TDL messages. The Signal PDU has several fields that must be set for Link:TDL Type (16-bit field): The DIS enumerations document specifies 16-bit enumerations for this field. These enumerations have been recently added (2002) to the SISO enumeration listing; prior to this, Link 11 and 16 were undefined types.Encoding Scheme Field: The first 2-bit two component (Radio Signal Encoding Class) of this 16-bit field must be set to 1 for Raw Binary Data while the second 14-bit component must be set to the number of TDL messages.The audio TDL data must then be digitized and stored in the Signal PDU’s data fields. Other TDL functions can be performed by using the Transmitter PDU (such as polling and frequency hopping).Simulated Link – NATO SIMPLE ProtocolSTANAG 5602, the Standard Interface for Multiple Link Evaluation (SIMPLE) [ seq references stanag_5602 \* MERGEFORMAT 23] is a NATO standard that specifies a means of transmitting data link and DIS packets (and other types) across a network. SISO Standards Activity for Data LinksSISO standards activity includes a study group and product development group [ seq references siso \* MERGEFORMAT 6]. The Tactical Data Link Study Group is creating a reference product for simulation of tactical data links, initially within the DIS framework, and later within HLA.The Link-16 Product Development Group is developing a SISO standard from the Study Group’s R&D to define the methods of simulating a Link-16 network within a DIS or HLA framework. Preliminary results for these products were presented at the 2002 Spring Simulation Interoperability Workshop [ seq references tadil_tales \* MERGEFORMAT 24 -  seq references bom_link16 \* MERGEFORMAT 25]. Data link messages are embedded into DIS Transmitter and Signal PDUs.Terrain Databases and ModelsADS exercises require development of terrain/ocean databases and also 3D models for out-of-the-window visualisation. Standard approaches to development of these models are described in the following sections.Standard Formats for Models and DatabasesThe OpenFlight format, produced by MultiGen, has become the de facto industry standard for visual databases [ seq references multigen \* MERGEFORMAT 26]. OpenFlight uses a hierarchical structure to store and organise the digital data that describes the 3D scenes used in visual databases. OpenFlight also provides the means of representing non-visual attributes including sound emitters for audio, light sources and degrees of freedom for the various entities. Many other formats are available for 3D objects – a compendium of these in included in [ seq references three_d_formats \* MERGEFORMAT 27]. Terrain DatabasesStandard Terrain DatabasesUnder the JOANNE Project a North Australian region database has been developed, a section of which is shown in  REF _Ref520017847 \h  \* MERGEFORMAT Figure 1. This database has considerable sea area to the northwest of Darwin whilst also including sufficient land area for combined air/maritime operations and high feature detail in the Darwin coastal region.Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 1: Section of Northern Australian DatabaseThe widely available Fort Hunter Liggett terrain database can also be used. A low detail database for the Hawaii region was developed for the CReaMS interoperability exercise in November 2001 [ seq references creams_pie \* MERGEFORMAT 4].A further database was developed for the Coalition Synthetic Battlespace exercise demonstrated at SimTecT 2002, encompassing the Shoalwater Bay area in Queensland.Terrain Database Development ToolsCOTS products such as Terrex’s Terra Vista can be used to develop terrain databases [ seq references terrex \* MERGEFORMAT 29]. Terra Vista runs on a PC platform and requires digital elevation, culture data, and imagery to generate a terrain database.The freeware GIMP tool can be used to compile and edit photographic imagery of regions of interest [ seq references gimp \* MERGEFORMAT 30]. For example, GIMP can mosaic several pictures into a larger picture and remove identification markings.Data Sources for Terrain Database DevelopmentDatabase development tools such as Terra Vista require considerable data to develop a terrain database (TDB). As described in [ seq references terrex \* MERGEFORMAT 29] there are five important classes of data required for terrain database construction:Elevation data – These data are generally provided as a grid of elevation values with a real world size and location. Elevation data for the US are available in: Digital Elevation Model format (DEM) or Digital Terrain Elevation Data format (DTED), from the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) [ seq references nima \* MERGEFORMAT 31].Culture – Cultural data refers to vector or cartographic data and is generally 2D map information which includes both artificial elements such as roads and building locations, and natural features such as riverbeds, lake outlines and forests.Imagery – This describes aerial or satellite photography covering the region of interest. Imagery, also known as geotexture, can be used either as source data (to delineate roads, for example) or in constructing the finished database. Imagery is also used to trace features such as roads, forests, oceans, and lakes. Models – These refer to objects such as the buildings and trees in a finished TDB.Textures – These are images used in the TDB to represent common features, such as pictures of trees or images of roads with marked lines.Visual ModelsStandard Visual ModelsThree dimensional visual models of aircraft, ships and other entities, such as that shown in  REF _Ref775604 \h  \* MERGEFORMAT Figure 2, are required for the out-of-the-window views of simulations. Where possible default models can be used; however other models may need to be developed to satisfy specific requirements. Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 2: 3D Model of FFG HMAS SYDNEY 3D Visual Model Development ToolsMultigen Creator has been used to develop new 3D models and to edit existing models which are not commercially available [ seq references multigen \* MERGEFORMAT 26]. Libraries of 3D models, such as Boeing 747 civilian airliners, can also be purchased and integrated into JOANNE exercises.Where possible the models need to be restricted to less than 1000 polygons so that they can be run in out-of-the-window visualisations. Experience has shown that models with more polygons can produce a deleterious effect on the visualisation of the simulation.3D Studio Max is being investigated as another tool for development of 3D models [ seq references threedsmax \* MERGEFORMAT 28].Recommendations for Terrain and 3D ModelsIt is recommended that the OpenFlight format be used for models and terrain databases. This will ensure the widest possible application of these models across the Australian simulation community.Scenario DevelopmentStandard ScenarioSeveral scenarios have been developed that can be used as standard scenarios for distributed simulation. The first of these comprised a detailed scenario and script prepared by RAN staff in conjunction with USN staff for the initial CReaMS exercise [ seq references creams_pie \* MERGEFORMAT 4]. This involved Australian and US forces forming a coalition naval battlegroup to defend the sovereignty of a friendly island nation in the Pacific Rim against a neighbouring hostile island nation. The second scenario was developed for the Coalition Synthetic Battlespace demonstration run at SimTecT 2002 and involved Australian and US coalition forces rescuing nationals trapped in a warfare zone with hostile militia and government forces in opposition.Scenario Generation ToolkitsCOTS systems such as STAGE, ITEMS, VR-Forces, and the US DoD JointSAF can all be used to develop scenarios. These systems are being evaluated within DSTO [ seq references clark_etal_cgf_report \* MERGEFORMAT 32] for their application within ADS exercises. Issues of capability for networking via either DIS or HLA, flexibility for interfaces, ease of scenario and tactics development, inherent Artificial Intelligence capability, and fidelity of models, are being investigated.Wide Area Network InteroperabilityDSTO has been involved in several distributed exercises which required Wide Area Networking skills. Initial experiments via The Technical Cooperation Program (TTCP) were reported in [ seq references ttcp_tr_jsa_1_1999 \* MERGEFORMAT 33 -  seq references ttcp_tr_jsa_2_1999 \* MERGEFORMAT 34]. More recently, through the CReaMS Project Arrangement, DSTO has been involved with linkages to the USN [ seq references creams_pie \* MERGEFORMAT 4]. These exercises provided valuable experience in setting up and running international distributed simulation exercises.WAN OptionsThe Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is an international communications standard for transmitting video, audio and data over digital telephone lines. ISDN provides a digital WAN offering regional, national and international connectivity with no restrictions or protocol specifications. It provides a “guaranteed bandwidth” service between simulation nodes.The Internet can also provide a connection between simulation nodes across international sites. In contrast to ISDN, an Internet connection accesses whatever bandwidth is available, and must share the available bandwidth with any other traffic. An Internet-based WAN does not have a guaranteed bandwidth and is thus considered as a lower class service than an ISDN WAN.ISDN ConnectivityIn most countries, including Australia, ISDN scales in increments of 64 kilobits per second (kbps). A 64 kbps bi-directional bearer channel is called a B-channel. A separate control data (D) channel, of either 16 or 64 kbps, depending on the ISDN service, transmits control signals to implement special features such as call waiting, call forwarding and communication between ISDN modems. Increasing the bandwidth of an ISDN network requires the addition of B-channels. Routers can automatically connect additional B-channels as they are required, namely bandwidth on demand.There are two standard types of ISDN service: the Basic Rate Interface and the Primary Rate Interface. ISDN services available in individual countries can be found on the World Wide Web.Scenario Development Bandwidth Estimation TechniqueDIS operates by broadcasting information about the simulated entities via PDUs on a network. These PDUs range in size from several hundred bits up to tens of kilobits. For large exercises involving many simulators and simulations, the network bandwidth required, and resulting load on the receiving processors, can become excessive. In the planning phases of a DIS exercise, the bandwidth requirements must be estimated. Network traffic depends on various factors, the main ones being the number and type of entity in the exercise, and the scenario being simulated. Techniques have been developed to estimate bandwidth requirements.WAN Router Options and RecommendationsA router is required to interface between the Network Terminating Unit/Terminal Adaptor and the DIS ethernet network. The router must be programmed using the network packet protocol to filter all unnecessary network traffic from the ISDN lines and to direct network packets to their correct destinations.JOANNE standards recommend that the same routers, or at least routers from the same manufacturer, are installed at each node of a DIS exercise WAN. Although ISDN is supposed to be an international standard, the authors have been unable to establish an ISDN connection when routers from more than one manufacturer were used. This becomes more critical if data compression is required; compression is more likely to be successful if the same manufacturer’s equipment is used at each node since compression is proprietary.Encryption Most ADF training simulators will typically operate at the classified level with secret data being used for systems performance. The recent international CReaMS February 2003 exercise used Motorola NES encryption systems. Standards for use of encryption in simulation exercises are still under investigation.Note that DIS includes simulated encryption for radio communications; there is a 16-bit Crypto System field in the Transmitter PDU with field values provided in the DIS enumerations document, and also a 16-bit Crypto Key ID field that includes a 15-bit key ID which must match with the receiver’s key if simulated encryption is being used.Summary and ConclusionsDSTO’s JOANNE Project was initiated to research simulation interoperability issues and promote the use of Advanced Distributed Simulation for Defence applications. R&D conducted under the auspices of the JOANNE project has resulted in the development of procedures and practices which can assist simulation projects to achieve their goal of interoperability with other systems and thus provide enhanced training options for the ADF.This paper has described a set of standards that can be used to provide guidance for ADF simulator interoperability. These standards can assist networking ADF simulators and simulations into successful Joint and Coalition synthetic training environments. The standards have been developed through practice with distributed simulation within DSTO, the ADF, and also via experimentation with international partners including TTCP nations and the USN.References seq references \* MERGEFORMAT 1.
