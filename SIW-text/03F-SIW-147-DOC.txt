Simulated Natural Environment (SNE) ForumChairDavid JodeitVice ChairWilliam RiggsSecretaryRobert Richbourg / Ronald MooreObjectives for this Workshop:Get feedback from forum attendees on structure and goals for future workshopsPresent special session on space weatherProvide update and status on SEDRISComments and Recommendations:There appears to be a large continuing interest in issues of fidelity, precision and accuracy.  SNE plans to have some follow on work for Spring, but the CC may want to consider a global workshop theme on this.Consensus from forum participants is that current format of having a mix of papers and invited presentations seems to be working fine.  They liked having a separation of times between the PDG/SG and the PRPs, but suggested that you may want to alternate days between them rather than front loading the week with PRPs and then having the PDG/SGs at the end. I posed the issue of whether or not computer graphics and visualization fits within the domain of the SNE PRP and the consensus is that it does.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)33Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)43Peak attendance (including joint sessions) (no joint sessions)43Total papers presented8“No-show” presentations0Other presentations and panel discussions9Recommended Reading List nominations (including previous nominations):03F-SIW-03703F-SIW-062
