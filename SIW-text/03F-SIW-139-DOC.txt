Information Operations – Intelligence, Surveillance & Reconnaissance(IO-ISR)OutbriefFall 03 SIWChairGary Waag, TITANVice ChairAndreas Tolk, VMASC/ODUSecretary-Vacant-Objectives for this Workshop:Continue to provide a forum for discussion and exchange of ideas related to IO and/or ISR modelingDiscuss history of IO-ISR forum, lack of discussion or progress towards any standards, and future of the ForumComments and Recommendations:Space modeling receiving increased attention, as demonstrated by three Space M&S-related papers presented jointly with Analysis & VWS.Invited briefing on the Virtual Network Simulator sparked discussion on a useful IO-effects taxonomy for network attacks that could lead to a valuable M&S STANDARD for IO modeling.  This would need a “Champion” to emerge to push the issue as the current IO-ISR leadership is standing down as of this workshop.Discussions were held about the fact that our Call For Papers (CFP) seems to have little influence on the papers that are submitted.  Rather, it seems that papers are submitted irrespective of the CFP, and then we try to sort them out to see which of the various Forum CFP’s the papers most closely fit.  Assuming others agree with this perception, this might merit revisiting the effort put into the development of our CFP every workshop.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)35Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)40Peak attendance (including joint sessions)55Total papers presented4“No-show” presentations0Other presentations and panel discussions1Recommended Reading List nominations (including previous nominations):None of the 4 papers presented was all that exciting
