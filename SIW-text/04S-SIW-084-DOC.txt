Because MOOTW concentrate on preventing war, maintaining peace, and supporting civil authorities, in addition to conventional warfare, training techniques must be enhanced accordingly.  To support that cause, human behaviors modeled in training simulation systems must be augmented to allow the most complete virtual training environment possible.  Not only are current simulation training systems inadequate for this type of functionality, but the necessary behaviors themselves have also not been thoroughly developed to fully immerse an individual into a complex environment that contains both threat and non-threat entities. For instance, how does a crowd dissipate when a weapon is fired into its midst?  If the crowd scatters, how is it modeled and how is it virtually demonstrated?  This paper attempts to address these issues by introducing the development of a new and particularly relevant behavior called crowd scattering. This behavior models the actions of a large group fleeing an enclosed area from a perceived threat.  It requires a mixture of individual and cooperative exploits.  To begin, this paper provides a brief overview of MOOTW followed by a synopsis of interesting behaviors related to this category of operations.  This paper then explains the development of this behavior by explaining the motive in great detail.  Following that is an explanation of how the development of a crowd scattering behavior can propel the advancement of other MOOTW behaviors.  The paper then concludes with a clarification of the possible applications and future directions as a result of this work.                            IntroductionOn August 6, 1945, the United States dropped Little Boy, the first atomic weapon used for strike purposes, on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, instantly killing thousands of people and serving as the prelude to the official ending of World War II.  That point in history marked the inception of a transition in the way that military operations are carried out.  Up until that date, military operations focused on the concept of overwhelming opposing forces with a larger, more powerful force.  In other words, the main premise was to outnumber the opposing soldiers, weapons, and vehicles.  Following the detonation of Little Boy and its brother, Fat Man, just three days later over the city of Nagasaki, military operations have embarked on a long, yet consistent, transition to MOOTW [1].  Mushroom cloud billowing over Hiroshima, Aug. 6, 1945 [2]Strategizing and planning for force-on-force engagements where the ultimate goal is to dominate the opposing force with greater numbers of soldiers, tanks, and aircraft have been replaced with tactics of a completely different sort.  In nearly sixty years, traditional military operations of conventional warfare have given way to operations that are less predictable, involve unconventional methods of attack, and include activities that may have nothing to do with direct combat.  As devastating as conventional warfare had become through thousands of years of conflict, the new form of military operations has developed into something potentially more destructive and quite certainly more challenging and interesting.As a result, training technologies and techniques must catch up and go through a similar transition.  While still vital to the well-trained United States military, conventional force-on-force training no longer has the same importance in military training.  As an example of this point, consider the recent sequence of events in the United States’ “War on Terror” in Iraq.  Clearly, the early stages of the invasion of Iraq involved the concept of using overwhelming military might in combat, completely obliterating any organized resistance from the Iraqi military.  However, many strategists and analysts predicted that the toughest battles would come not from the blitzkrieg through the desert regions of the country, but in the task of securing the major cities and transitioning into a different form of government.Another mushroom cloud billowing over Nagasaki, Aug. 9, 1945 [2]While some would state that this point is debatable, evidence would seem to suggest that, just as predicted, the most difficult portion of the operation has, indeed, been the transition from dictatorship to another form of representative government.  Statistics collected since the official end of hostilities in the region seem to support this conclusion, as dozens of coalition soldiers have lost their lives while attempting to maintain the peace since combat operations ceased.  Yet, complete and thorough training methods of these types of duties have not been thoroughly developed, a point this paper addresses.MOOTW OverviewAccording to [3], military operations fit into one of two categories.  The first of those categories is what is most commonly thought of when considering military operations – that of war.  During war, the U.S. military attempts to defeat an opponent by use of overwhelming force while inflicting as few military, and particularly civilian, casualties as possible.  Strategically, the goal is to cease hostilities on terms favorable to the U.S. as quickly as possible and return to peacetime status.  All other operations are considered to be part of MOOTW.Although MOOTW can also include armed conflict between two opposing forces, it also encompasses far more potential tasks than war.  Though not always the case, MOOTW are generally operations performed during peacetime that involve maintaining the peace and influencing world events.  Examples of peaceful operations can include, but are not limited to, counter-drug actions, disaster relief, civil support tasks, and national assistance.  MOOTW examples involving potential combat can include strikes and raids, enforcement of the peace, support against violent insurgency, counter terrorism, and non-combatant evacuation efforts from hazardous locations.MOOTW In PracticeSince 1992, three well-publicized examples of MOOTW activities taking place with documented pitfalls have taken place.  The first such example took place in Somalia with the United Nations sanctioned Operation Rescue Hope.  This operation, led by the United States, was intended to provide protection for international famine relief workers attempting to distribute food to the hungry.  As an offshoot of the operation, the United States launched a separate initiative to apprehend a Somali warlord who threatened the food supply.  Poor intelligence and insufficient political analysis led to the deadliest operation in U.N. peacekeeping history as approximately 100 Army rangers and commandoes engaged a group of several hundred Somali soldiers.  Nineteen U.S. servicemen died, with another seventy-seven being wounded, and one pilot being taken prisoner.More recently, the two separate nation-building activities taking place in Afghanistan and Iraq qualify as MOOTW and have posed significant stumbling blocks for military units not well trained in this type of operation.  In both countries, after the military effectively wiped out the opposing forces with ease, those same military personnel are struggling with the tasks involved with peacekeeping, nation building, hunger relief, and other related duties.  Altogether, these serve as excellent examples of how the military needs to augment its training capabilities for MOOTW.Despite the frequency with which MOOTW are performed, training for such operations suffers from a number of shortcomings.  According to Michael M. Smith, a Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Army Reserve, military units are not well trained for the types of missions that fall into the MOOTW category.  As such, he wrote in [4]:“Even well trained combat units will not be ready for the change in perceptions, attitudes, operating tempo, and activities required in civilian-military operations (CMOs) and military operations other than war (MOOTW) without additional training.  Warfighting skills do not transfer directly to peace operations, disaster relief, humanitarian assistance, or many other CMO/MOOTW missions”This statement suggests that military officials are aware of the need for further and improved training for MOOTW.  Determining why is beyond the scope of this paper, but the mere admission of a need for improved training provides more than enough ammunition to closely examine possible concepts and directions.What is Crowd Scattering?To model MOOTW in a computer simulation system, many new behaviors need to be studied and implemented.  While this is certainly not an easy task, the overall problem can be made to look simpler if taken one behavior at a time – much like a divide and conquer approach.  For that reason, we decided that a crowd-scattering behavior would be of great interest and greater value to the overarching goal of modeling MOOTW behaviors for the purpose of training.Crowd scattering poses an interesting set of problems because of the nature of the behavior.  The types of MOOTW training exercises that might make use of this behavior would include, but not be limited to, counter terrorism, hostage rescue, disaster relief, and urban warfare.  Additionally, a crowd scattering behavior also can prove both challenging and rewarding because it is a mix of individual and group coordinated behaviors.Consider a scenario unfolding at a public venue populated with many individuals.  A variety of personnel can populate this venue under normal circumstances, from average pedestrians to area employees.  Without any prior warning, a single individual pulls out a firearm and shoots several shots into the air.  Undoubtedly, this type of situation would create a panic throughout the crowd, resulting in a massive scattering away from the perceived threat.  At first, most individuals fleeing would act upon their own whims with a number of different actions – ducking, hiding behind barriers, running to escape routes, and some even freezing, a fear-induced state causing individuals to take no action at all.  The group motion witnessed from this behavior would likely look random, unorganized, and reasonless.  However, as some individuals find successful strategies for avoiding the threat such as leaving the premises, more persons would follow, resulting in a more ordered pattern of motion.The following section provides a brief overview of how this hybrid, individual and group behavior might be implemented.Other Scattering WorkTo start, it must be noted that modeling crowd behaviors is not a novel concept.  Throughout the years, many applications from entertainment to crowd-control studies by law enforcement agencies, have attempted to make use of a variety of crowd behavior models for their unique purposes.  These efforts have differed in purpose and in modeling techniques from the crowd scattering behavior being presented in this paper.The exemplary instances of this type of work fit into one of two categories: Crowd Movement and Crowd Fleeing, both differing from crowd scattering in subtle ways.  Crowd Movement concerns the ability to model simple movements of a large number of gathered people, and involves little extraordinary movement.  Crowd Fleeing is similar to scattering, with some noteworthy differences.A number of applications have employed crowd movement, from entertainment to behavioral studies.  Several movies, including Walt Disney’s animated version of The Hunchback of Notre Dame, have used rudimentary crowd movement techniques for creating realistic looking scenes involving large numbers of gathering people [5][6].  Franco Tecchia, et al, led another effort to model crowd movement. in a project for urban behavior representations [7].  The purpose of this endeavor was to model a realistic populated urban virtual environment, with all the crowds and traffic that come with it.  The authors concluded that their architecture design could effectively model the crowd movements necessary for an urban environment, but also acknowledged that their strategy was completely unusable for thousands of individual entities.Daniel Thalman, et al. also modeled crowd movement for the purpose of studying individual and group interactions in a crowded space so that more realistic virtual humans or actors, as the authors refer to them, can be effectively implemented [8].  Their work proved fairly successful, though it did not address the unique problems involved with modeling a group panic state that is followed by a scattering movement.The concept of crowd fleeing, something that has already been modeled, differs from crowd scattering in a number of ways [9].  The root, flee, is defined by [10] as, “to run away, as from trouble or danger,” or, “to pass swiftly away; vanish.”  While this may seem synonymous with scatter, significant contrasts exist.  To start off, fleeing suggests a thought-out plan that can take an individual to safety.  Scattering involves at least a small period of random movement that has no conscious thought process associated with it.  Furthermore, modeling fleeing behavior considers the group as an individual unit.  While individuals might react to other individuals, like in a scattering behavior, they do not follow or learn from other individuals as in a scattering behavior.These important differences separate crowd scattering behavior modeling from other previous efforts that have fallen into the crowd movement and crowd fleeing categories.Crowd Scattering DevelopmentA crowd scattering behavior has one important characteristic that must be fully understood to realize its value.  Essentially, the crowd scattering behavior consists of two separate and distinct but cooperative behaviors, one of which is entirely individual while the other stands out as a hybrid between group and individual activities.  The first behavior can best be described as completely random motion.  The individual entities fleeing a venue would move instinctively and individually based on each individual entity’s perception of a potential threat.  The direction and speed of each individual entity’s motion would vary greatly and the result would be that the group’s motion would appear random in nature, even if some of the entities move with specific purpose.  The motion observed during this first stage can include, but are not necessarily limited to:Freezing – not moving at all as a result of fear and not knowing what action to takeDucking – quickly laying on the ground to avoid the perceived threatRunning randomly – running in any direction just to move away from where the individual was at the time that the perceived threat appeared Exiting – Entities who are close to a possible exit may do so immediatelyThe second behavior important to crowd scattering is closely related to the flocking behavior developed by Thomas G. Grubb at RiverSoftAVG [11].  A demonstration application allows users to set certain characteristics of the movement, such as:Separation Strength – the ‘desire’ of one entity to keep a minimum distance from other entitiesAlignment Strength – the ‘desire’ of one entity to move in the same direction as nearby entitiesCohesion Strength – the ‘desire’ of one entity to remain close to other entitiesAvoidance Strength – the ‘desire’ of one entity to not collide with obstacles (see Figure 1)The flocking-based portion of the crowd scattering behavior would have the following rough settings:Separation Strength – mediumAlignment Strength – highCohesion Strength – highAvoidance Strength – mediumIn other words, a typical entity performing the scattering algorithm would wish to keep a moderate distance from other entities, but would attempt to move in the same distance and in a group.  A single entity would also avoid obstacles, but not to the point of making 180-degree changes in direction to avoid an obstacle.  The entity would simply change course to go around the obstacle or possibly even use the obstacle to its advantage as a hiding place.  Essentially, when appropriate, the crowd scattering behavior would begin with each entity taking its own unique action for a period of time.  Each entity might freeze, duck, run randomly, or exit the situation immediately if the opportunity presents itself.  After that initial reaction wears off, a more organized, group dynamic would unfold with people moving in varied groups away from any perceived threat, much like a flocking algorithm.Figure 1, Screen From Flocking Demo [11]We believe that this algorithm would accurately describe the motion common when a panic-stricken crowd scatters from a location.  To prove that point, it is our intention to implement, test, and study this algorithm within our gaming/simulation environment.Crowd Scattering and BeyondAn important question that deserves asking is, “Why develop a crowd scattering behavior?”  Certainly, many other interesting behaviors exist that pertain either directly or indirectly to MOOTW.  What makes the crowd scattering worthy of study? And furthermore, what makes a crowd scattering behavior worth implementing right now?Without wishing to answer a question with a question, we can only think to respond by asking in turn, “How can one decide which behavior to start with?”  However, in an effort to be more thorough and scientific, we offer a number of more substantial explanations as well.As mentioned before and supported by a number of credible sources, MOOTW training currently lags sorely behind conventional military training, despite the clearly large amount of MOOTW performed by the U.S. military in the present day.  For a number of reasons, these types of behaviors require unique, creative, and untapped solutions to accurately implement them. Issues such as unpredictability, diverse populations to consider, far ranging economic and social environments, and assorted climatic and geographic environments all make MOOTW operations difficult to perform because they are just as difficult to train for.Considering these facts that strongly suggest the need for such training, coupled with the ease with which to create a test environment and the expected ease of integrating into already existing systems, we believe that crowd scattering serves as an excellent starting point for the research and development of MOOTW behaviors.  As pointed out before, this type of behavior has a mixture of individual and group behaviors, a concept still not fully understood by developers.  This can serve as an exercise to learn and improve upon that set of skills so that lessons can be applied to further efforts.  Additionally, this behavior requires a small amount of learning and remembering capability, as a single entity must remember where it has been, why it chose other directions, and what happened as a result of that decision.  This aspect of reasoning that includes cause and effect poses an interesting problem in and of itself.  Furthermore, as the behavior is implemented, the research environment can serve as a learning platform for the development of subsequent behaviors for that can be applied to MOOTW training.With these points in mind, it is our intention to fully implement, test, and integrate the crowd scattering behavior into any of a number of simulation systems already widely available.  This effort will serve as a springboard into further behavior development for the purpose of improving training in the military for MOOTW.As with any research idea, the crowd-scattering behavior must first be exhaustively analyzed in a verifiably stable test environment.  In a previous internal research and development effort, we have developed a simulation system integrating a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) game engine and a parallel discrete event simulation engine in an attempt to take advantage of the positives of both products.  More specifically, the COTS game engine specializes in graphics-intensive applications while the simulation engine is more equipped to handle cognitive behaviors.  Currently, the simulation is set in an airport environment and depicts a lone gunman opening fire on a small number of airport pedestrians, though the venue can be modified to reflect any of a number of other locales.  The demonstration application displays two views – one is a three-dimensional display from the first shooter point-of-view and the second is a two-dimensional display of the terrain, as shown in Figures 2 and 3.  Figure 2, Gunman aiming for pedestriansCurrently, the individual pedestrians follow pre-scripted paths to exits and hiding spots throughout the airport, unless hit by a bullet fired by the gunman, displaying absolutely no realistic or intelligent behavior at all.  Despite this current shortcoming, this system can serve as an excellent setting for testing a crowd scattering algorithm, which can add realism and some measure of intelligence to the scattering individuals’ behaviors, thus serving as a springboard into further behavior development for the purpose of improving realism in OOTW training applications [12]. With relatively minimal modifications, we can augment the crowd behaviors in this application so that the individual entities behave more realistically.  For this application, it would make it more difficult for the shooter to hit targets because the individual entities would not be following the same pre-scripted paths every time, but more random and varied paths instead.  In other applications, this would provide a more realistic environment for military and law-enforcement personnel to train. EMBED MSPhotoEd.3  Figure 3, Two-dimensional Representation of Terrain With PedestriansClearly, with the foundation for a testing environment already in place and a well-developed algorithm ready to be implemented, a crowd scattering behavior can serve as a launching pad for improved MOOTW training.ConclusionEvidently, Military Operations Other Than War pose tremendous obstacles for the serving force responsible for the defense and security of the United States and its allies.  This contention has been clearly evident in past excursions in the Balkans, Africa, and presently in the Middle East region.  The United States military, trained largely for conventional warfare operations has few peers in the world in terms of conventional warfare, a fact made more obvious with recent combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.  However, the MOOTW activities that have dominated the regions since conventional warfare operations have been declared ceased have tasted lower levels of success.This notable and unfortunate decline in achievement is easily traced to the inferior level of training in place for MOOTW in the military.  Because of the vastly complex nature of MOOTW, this problem cannot be solved without substantial commitment of resources.  The suggestion of this single interesting behavior takes only a miniscule step towards a possible solution for the overall set of problems.  However, it still is a step that can serve as a springboard for future work.Developing this crowd scattering behavior will require solutions to other sub-problems that are necessary to the development of other MOOTW behaviors as well as a more thorough understanding of the integration of group and individual behaviors into a single overarching behavior.  With a successful research effort on this single behavior, a solid foundation can be laid for that future research that can ultimately improve the level of training for MOOTW by vast and immeasurable amounts.References[1] Thomas, Even, “Why We Did It,” Newsweek, July 24, 1995, pages 22-30.[2] “Hiroshima and Nagasaki,”   HYPERLINK "http://history1900s.about.com/library/weekly/aa072700a.htm" http://history1900s.about.com/library/weekly/aa072700a.htm[3] “FM 100-11: Force Integration,”  HYPERLINK "http://www.adtdl.army.mil/cgi-bin/atdl.dll/fm/10011/fm100-11.pdf" www.adtdl.army.mil/cgi-bin/atdl.dll/fm/10011/fm100-11.pdf, January 5, 1998.[4] Smith, Michael M. and Melinda Hoffstetter, “Conduit or Cul-de-sac?
