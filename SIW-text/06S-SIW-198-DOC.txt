Dear EDCS PDG Members,During the Fall 2005 SIW EDCS PDG meeting, recommendations were made to form a SISO Product Support Group (PSG) to provide post-standardization support and maintenance for the EDCS as well as ensure the continued applicability of the EDCS to SISO community needs.During the recent Spring 2006 SIW EDCS PDG Meeting,  exciting progress was made toward achieving the goal to establish this new PSG.  A Committee Draft PSG Terms of Reference (TOR) has now been prepared for submission to the SISO Standards Activity Committee (SAC) for approval to establish the new PSG.  The proposed PSG will be named the Environmental Data Representation Standards PSG and will have an expanded role to support additional environmental data representation standards as needed.The following is a summary of the activities and accomplishments from the Spring 2006 SIW EDCS PDG meeting.  For this meeting, Mr. Michael Leite served as the acting EDCS PDG Chair.- An overview briefing on the organization and operation of SISO Product Support Groups (PSGs)  was presented to provide background and details on the establishment of new PSGs.  It was noted that the new Environmental Data Representation Standards (EDRS) PSG would be somewhat different from other PSGs in that it would not be the sponsor of any standards; rather it would support the activities of Subcommittee 24 (SC-24) of Joint Technical Committee 1 (JTC-1) of the International Organization for Standardization and the International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC). - The discussion following the PSG briefing included the proposed Committee Draft PSG Terms of Reference (TOR).  Recommended improvements included updates to the wording to reflect the participatory nature of the SISO PSG involvement with SC-24.  In addition, several clarifications were proposed with respect to the specific tasking for the PSG.  The members present at the EDCS PDG meeting concurred with the proposed changes and the changes have been incorporated into the draft TOR that is being submitted to the SAC for approval. - The following set of action items were recorded, moved by Mr. Campbell, seconded by Mr. Mamaghani and unanimously approved by those present. a. That the existing Environmental Data Coding Specification (EDCS) PDG be disestablished by the SISO SAC.b. That the new Environmental Data Representation Standards (EDRS) PSG be established by the SISO SAC with an initial membership consisting of the existing EDCS PDG members and those SISO members participating in the recent Spring 2006 SIW PSG organizational meeting.c. That the Committee Draft PSG TOR for the Environmental Data Representation Standards (EDRS) PSG be approved by the SISO SAC.d. That a new SISO Reflector (webboard discussion) be established for the new PSG and all data from the previous EDCS PDG be transferred to the new reflector.e. That nominations for officers of the new PSG be opened and an election by the PSG membership scheduled.f. That Ms. Peggy Gravitz, the SAC Representative to th! e new PSG be appointed as the interim chairman of the PSG pending the completion of the nomination and election process.g. That Mr. Bob Richbourg, the outgoing chairman of the EDCS PDG, and the EDCS PDG members be commended by SISO for their efforts in support of the development of the EDCS ISO/IEC Standard.- The EDCS PDG meeting was adjourned and the acting PDG Chair thanked all of the participants in the meeting and indicated that a summary of the meeting would be forwarded to the existing EDCS PDG reflector members.As progress is made in the coming weeks toward the approval of the new PSG, updates will be provided by email to the existing EDCS PDG email reflector.Thank you,Very Respectfully,Peggy GravitzTo reply: HYPERLINK "mailto:SAC-PDG-EDCS.43510@discussions.sisostds.org?subject=SISO%20Spring%202006%20SIW%20--%20EDCS%20PDG%20Meeting%20Report%20-%20Plans%20for%20the%20Transition%20to%20new%20SISO%20Product%20Support%20Group%20(PSG)" \o "mailto:SAC-PDG-EDCS.43510@discussions.sisostds.org?subject=SISO Spring 2006 SIW -- EDCS PDG Meeting Report - Plans for the Transition to new SISO Product Support Group (PSG)" SAC-PDG-EDCS.43510@discussions.sisostds.orgTo start a new topic: HYPERLINK "mailto:SAC-PDG-EDCS@discussions.sisostds.org" \o "mailto:SAC-PDG-EDCS@discussions.sisostds.org" SAC-PDG-EDCS@discussions.sisostds.orgTo view discussion:  HYPERLINK "http://discussions.sisostds.org/default.asp?boardid=2&action=9&read=40062&fid=34" \o "http://discussions.sisostds.org/default.asp?boardid=2&action=9&read=40062&fid=34" http://discussions.sisostds.org/default.asp?boardid=2&action=9&read=40062&fid=34To (un)subscribe: HYPERLINK "mailto:SAC-PDG-EDCS.list-request@discussions.sisostds.org" \o "mailto:SAC-PDG-EDCS.list-request@discussions.sisostds.org" SAC-PDG-EDCS.list-request@discussions.sisostds.org with the word unsubscribe in the message body.SISO:  HYPERLINK "http://www.sisostds.org/" \o "http://www.sisostds.org/" http://www.sisostds.org/
