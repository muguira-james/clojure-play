This includes both M&S to model network centric operations as well as M&S services to support the warfighter operationally and for training.  This workshop will provide a forum for conversation among Warfighters and developers regarding standards for development and employment of M&S within the services' network centric warfare environments such as FORCEnet and FCS, including M&S in support of training, operations, and acquisition of FORCEnet, FCS, or GIG-related capabilities.Theme Chair:  Katherine L. Morse <katherine.l.morse@saic.com>INDIVIDUAL FORUM AND GROUP CALL FOR PAPERSGenerally, papers and presentations are considered in three main categories:●    	User Community Forums, which examine and promote topics of interest related to the use   and adequacy of available simulation capabilities and new capabilities needed by M&S users.●	Specialty Area Forums, which examine and promote current and emerging simulation processes and technology.●	Special Sessions, which deal with topics that merit timely solicitation of feedback from the SISO community.See HYPERLINK http://www.sisostds.org/siw/forums/index.htm http://www.sisostds.org/siw/forums/index.htm for a detailed list of the Forums, Study Groups, and Product Development Groups meeting at this workshop.USER COMMUNITY FORUMSAnalysis (ANL)ANL focuses on interoperability issues and uses of distributed models and simulations by the analysis community, including issues of experiment design and data analysis, analysis issues in ADS and SBA, requirements definition.  Special focus:  use cases that include both success and failure.Research, Development, and Engineering (RDE)RDE addresses issues and applications of distributed M&S within the RDE domain, including requirements for backward compatibility between simulations and distributed simulation infrastructures.  RDE focuses on community requirements and experiences with new applications using distributed computing technologies.  RDE specifically solicits papers that advance the "state of the art" and/or take a position, however controversial.  Authors targeting papers to the RDE Forum must include, as the final slide in their presentations, a summary of the paper's key findings or concepts and identifying issues for the RDE Community.System Acquisition and Product Development (SAPD)SAPD focuses on M&S and related enablers of integrated, collaborative enterprises for system/product development, particularly from a life-cycle wide, mission capability/system-of-systems perspective.  Subjects include policy, processes, tool suite strategies, information management, standards, resource sharing/reuse, business case, intellectual property protection, collaboration/optimization means and work force implications. Priority is on actual, broadly-applicable experiences in these areas.Test and Evaluation (TE)TE addresses uses of distributed simulation in test and evaluation (T&E), including the integration of live entities with virtual and constructive simulations; the integration of hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL), Integrated Systems Test Facilities (ISTFs), and other T&E facilities with distributed simulations; the use of simulation to test and evaluate C4ISR, Systems of Systems (SoS), Family of Systems (FoS), and interoperability; and performance issues in using distributed simulation in T&E applications.Training (TRAIN)The TRAIN forum focuses on issues associated with using simulations to support the acquisition of knowledge, skills, behaviors, and attitudes through education, training, and performance support.  We solicit papers addressing simulation-based learning in industry, academia, and government (including the DOD), particularly those identifying interoperability or standards shortfalls or requirements.  Special interest topics: (1) simulation support of all aspects of Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) and Distributed Mission Training (DMT) Programs: education, training, and performance support (e.g., embedded training, Computer-Based Training, automated performance assessment, mission rehearsal, Course of Action analysis, etc.);(2) simulation support to training events associated with Small Scale Contingencies (SSCs), Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT), Support and Stability Operations (SASO), and other related combat and non-combat activities and; (3) single vs multi-player/student training issues or lessons learned (individual vs collective/team simulation-based learning).SPECIALTY AREA FORUMSCommand, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I)C4I addresses standards to ensure interoperability when coupling simulation systems and C4I systems, standards to ensure composability when integrating simulation components and C4I components into a common framework, and standards to represent C4I systems and the underlying infrastructure within simulation applications. For the Spring 2005 SIW, C4I is looking for papers dealing with:  ● Network Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) / Web-Based Services  ● Modeling of Communications Effects  ● Metadata / Data Interchange Standards  ● Use of Command and Control Information Exchange Data Model (C2IEDM) and/or C2IEDM        Extensions  ● Simulation use in support of Systems Engineering  ● Modeling and Simulation (M&S) services deployment and use in a Service Oriented      Architecture (SOA)Communication, Frameworks, and Infrastructure (CFI)CFI focuses on technologies that support interoperation and run-time execution of distributed simulations.  Historical examples include the HLA Run-Time Infrastructure (RTI), DIS, ALSP, and SPEEDES.  The Forum will also consider new and alternate infrastructure concepts, such as web-based technologies.  Topics include performance data, implementation and design details, usage strategies, networking techniques, fault tolerance, security considerations, and middleware or other frameworks for constructing, utilizing, or extending simulation infrastructure.  NOTE:  The CFI forum replaces and incorporates the former RTI&C forum.Distributed Simulation Processes and Tools (DSPT)DSPT focuses on evolving a generalized system engineering process for developing and executing distributed simulations, and on the tools used for automating various aspects of distributed simulations.  This includes "lessons learned" solutions from creating real-world, useful M&S applications, such as problems of integration, scalability, reuse, and robustness.  Automation of various aspects of distributed simulations includes scenario development, initialization, monitoring, runtime controls, collection and repositories, visualization, and after-action review.Information Operations - Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (IO-ISR)IO-ISR seeks papers that deal with all aspects of Information Operations (IO), including computer network attack and defense, modeling of IO in exercise and training, and threats to the Internet and other communications infrastructures.  IO-ISR seeks papers addressing Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) issues including representation of the different intelligence disciplines (e.g., SIGINT, IMINT, HUMINT, etc.) and the associated Tasking, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (TPED) systems and processes associated with the delivery of intelligence products to the warfighter.  In addition, we are interested in activities related to modeling IO-ISR, including Effects-Based Operations, Network Centric Warfare, Predictive Battlespace Awareness and crisis response.Logistics and Enterprise Models (LOG)LOG focuses on simulations and simulation challenges associated with modeling supply chains, logistics management processes, logistics policies and business practices, as well as the portrayal of logistics in military simulations at all levels.  Topics of interest include innovative approaches to supporting network centric operations, rapid deployment forces, Operations Other Than War (OOTW), global commercial operations, and enterprise process simulations.  The latter include but are not limited to executable models of work flow, manufacturing, distribution, transportation and customer, patient, crowd, or traffic flow.Medical Simulation (MED)MED focuses on interoperability standards that build upon already extensive medical interface standards for operational systems for robot-assisted surgery; command and control systems for medical situational awareness; medical models of varying resolutions for research and development; training systems for instruction and rehearsal; imaging systems for treatment planning and assessment; and logistic planning systems for security and disaster response.Simulated Natural Environment/Sensor Modeling (SNE/SENS)SNE addresses multi-domain use and reuse of digital representations and models of the natural environment, including land, oceanic, atmospheric, and space data.  SNE also focuses on standards for, and application of, SNE data, effects and data models for M&S; interoperability issues and lessons learned in large-scale integrated simulations that include multiple real-time and non-real-time SNE representations; and issues and use cases relating to SEDRIS, environmental data classification systems, and coordinate transformation systems.  SNE also includes topics previously listed separately by the Sensor Modeling and Simulation Forum, including simulation of sensor effects, issues pertaining to the stimulation and simulation of sensor systems, incorporation of sensor system simulations into other simulations, and environmental effects on sensor systems.Synthetic Mission Space Composability (SMS-COMPOSE)SMS focuses on efforts underway within the Services and across the Joint and International community.  The Forum includes a panel session, conducted each workshop, addressing a particular issue or topic of interest.  Panelists will include representatives from Service, Joint, and OSD efforts in Synthetic Mission Spaces.  One critical focus of the Panel session will be to identify areas of collaboration (as well as non-collaboration) among the various participants. It will expose as well needs and potential solutions.  The objective is to explore ways to integrate various environments on-demand, so that the best tools and products available are brought to bear on a particular problem.Verification, Validation & Accreditation (VV&A)VV&A focuses on methodologies, procedures, and associated techniques used to establish credibility of models, simulations, and federations.  VV&A goals emphasize quality (e.g., building in authoritative representations and behaviors) and risk management, and support development and evolution of VV&A guidance to enhance the federation lifecycle process.  Current objectives include evolving a model for validation process maturity, formalizing the conceptual model via the Conceptual Model Study Group, and establishing recommended practices for federation VV&A via the VV&A PDG.  Special focus areas include validation process maturity model, conceptual model validation, and substantive interoperability.Vehicle/Weapon System Modeling (VWS)VWS focuses on lessons learned in development of vehicle or weapon system simulations (including Computer Generated Forces (CGF) and Semi-Automated Forces (SAF) simulations) and Simulation Based Acquisition (SBA) of actual vehicle and weapon systems (DD 21, Joint Strike Fighter, Future Combat System, etc.).STUDY GROUPSStudy Groups (SGs) are chartered when SISO wants to obtain recommendations on well-defined issues from groups of volunteer experts selected from appropriate Forums.  Study Group sessions at this Workshop include:Assessment of the Need for Product Data Representation Standards (ANPDRS SG)The data required to represent systems and products in M&S is broad and diverse, including requirements, conceptual and physical design, manufacturing means, cost, system performance, and the product's operational and support environment.  The ANPDRS SG is reviewing existing methods of representing product data, identifying significant gaps in product data representation standards and ongoing activities to address these gaps, and, as warranted, recommending SISO Product Development Group(s) to begin formulation of needed standards.  Coalition Battle Management Language (CBML SG)Generally, Battle Management Language (BML) is the unambiguous language used to (1) command and control forces and equipment conducting military operations, and (2) provide for situational awareness and a shared, common operational picture.  It can be seen as a standard representation of a digitized commander's intent to be used for real troops, for simulated troops, and for future robotic forces.  BML is particularly relevant in a network centric environment for enabling mutual understanding.  A Coalition BML, as envisioned by this study group in this proposal, developed and applied by the all Services and by coalition members would not only allow interoperability among their C4ISR systems and simulations, but also among themselves.Common Image Generator Interface (CIGI SG)The goal of the CIGI SG is to evaluate industry and government interest in developing a standard image generator interface.  Typically, today's Image Generator (IG) vendors have their own closed, proprietary run-time interfaces.  At I/ITSEC'02, Boeing  proposed their Open Source Common Image Generator Interface (CIGI) as a run-time interface that could be adopted by the simulation community.  Boeing indicated that they would like to see a standards organization adopt CIGI and develop it into a robust and broadly accepted simulation industry image generator run-time interface standard.  The SG is discussing this proposal, evaluating alternatives, and generating recommendations and a proposed action plan.Discrete-Event Systems Specification (DEVS SG)DEVS has a theoretical foundation which makes it in principle independent of various programming languages and hardware platforms.  There is a wide variety of groups working on extensions to the DEVS formalism, with several modeling tools based on these extensions. The goal of the study group will be to find a core of the DEVS formalism that is suitable for standardization of activities at the level of modeling.  It will bridge the gap between existing simulation frameworks and modeling activities using a standard notation.  The DEVS SG is studying the possibility of developing standards for a computer processable representation of DEVS that supports common understanding, sharing and interoperability of DEVS implementations.  Computer processable forms include all forms of simulation and real-time execution as well as various forms of syntactic and semantic analysis.Extensible Modeling Simulation Framework Profile (XMSF Profile SG)The XMSF Profile SG has several high-level requirements derived from years of experience with M&S frameworks and the challenges of their effective deployment across diverse networks and systems.  XMSF must enable simulations to interact directly and scalably over a highly distributed network, achieved through compatibility between a web framework and networking technologies.  The specification of XMSF will be in the form of a collection of profiles detailing how to interoperate with XMSF-compliant systems.  These profiles will enable inter-and intra- domain interoperability.  The initial profile content and structure must be agreed on.  As the underlying technologies and standards evolve, the profiles and will need to be upgraded to maintain interoperability.  The purpose of this SG is to determine the required scope for XMSF profiles and to define their structure.Intelligent Tutoring System Interoperability (ITSI SG)The ITSI SG is working on interoperability between components of simulation-based training environments that include Socratic and didactic tutoring and coaching, personalized After-Action Review (AAR) and performance assessment, management of individual or team curriculum progress, student modeling, natural language dialog interaction with intelligent agents, authoring tools for creating or modifying courseware objects and ITS behavior, and quantitative measures of training effectiveness. The SG will draw on results from previous and concurrent efforts such as the Shareable Courseware Object Reference Model (SCORM), the Joint Modeling and Simulation (JMASS) Modeling and Simulation Reuse Library (MSRL), and the JSIMS Learning Methodology Working Group (LMWG), as well as standards developed by the Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C).Medical Modeling and Simulation Interoperability (MM&S SG)Medical simulation systems have unique technical, operational, and regulatory requirements and serve a broad array of users and customers. Medical simulation increasingly needs interoperability standards that build upon already extensive medical interface standards. The MM&S SG  is identifying categories of M&S applications needed by the health care community and defining relevant information exchange requirements.Mode 5/Select Identification Friend or Foe (MODE 5/S IFF SG)The Mode 5 IFF SISO Study Group (SG) is established to support the DoD/Joint service/NATO simulation community effort to develop the necessary changes to allow live, virtual and constructive simulations incorporate Mode 5 IFF. The key protocols to review will be DIS, HLA, existing Live Range IFF protocols and TENA as these are the most widely used ones when exchanging exercise truth data. The HLA review includes a review of the RPR FOM and selected other FOMs and SOMs that include IFF information.A preliminary investigation indicates that there is no central DoD organization that is responsible for ensuring that Mode 5 simulation standards are developed, agreed to and implemented in a timely manner.  Work needs to begin immediately to bring under control independent efforts, such as the Navy's draft Supplemental IFF PDU that is designed to implement Mode 5, so different organizations are not developing solutions that will cause interoperability issues. Also, the sooner that changes to protocol standards can be developed; the sooner simulations and simulators can be upgraded.Open Run Time Infrastructure Protocol (ORTI SG)The ORTI SG is a proposed communication and implementation standard for the High Level Architecture (HLA) RTI. Message formats and data handling algorithms for RTI services are encapsulated in an open, message-based protocol.  The handling algorithms for RTI services are encapsulated in an open, message-based protocol.  The study group is investigating the applicability of the Open RTI Protocol, facilitating interoperability between RTI implementations and promoting Research and Development (R&D).Simulation Conceptual Modeling (SCM SG)The SCM SG is conducting a preliminary investigation on the use of conceptual modeling in M&S and related information technology domains.  The study group will perform exploratory work into the establishment of best practices for simulation conceptual modeling, and establish recommendations for persistent management of the topic within SISO.Simulation Reference Markup Language (SRML SG)This SG is focusing on standardizing a simulation markup language and corresponding simulation engine specification based on the Simulation Reference Markup Language (SRML). We will be capturing the goals needs, business case, and potential benefits to the simulation community, and summarizing the SRML survey. Additional discussions will relate SRML, to HLA, BOMs, XMSF, MDA, and other emerging trends, as well as various forms of standardization. Participants will have an opportunity to see Web-Based Simulation demonstrations, and discuss technical details.Transfer of Control (TC SG)The TC SG is identifying design deficiencies and areas that need clarification related to the transfer control function. It will determine the changes needed to the DIS IEEE 1278.1a 1998 standard and to the HLA RPR FOM to ensure that transfer control implementations will be compatible between simulators. Goals for this SIW include reaching agreement on a basic set of enumerations to be used for transfer control which will be submitted to the DIS Enumeration group; reviewing draft changes and clarifications to the issuance and receipt rules for the Transfer Control PDU and HLA interactions; discussing restoring entity ownership information to DIS PDUs and the HLA RPR FOM; and agreeing on a timetable for formalizing the changes and presenting them.PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT GROUPSProduct Development Groups (PDGs) are approved to generate specific SISO Products (Standards, Guides, and Reference Products) after approval of a formal Product Nomination.  Current Product Development Groups includeBase Object Model Specification (BOM PDG)The BOM PDG is developing a specification for Base Object Models.  The open standardization of BOMs is essential for establishing component technology to facilitate interoperability, reusability and composability.  As part of this standardization effort, the PDG will define an XML schema to identify the base elements and ontology of a BOM and provide guidance describing how BOMs can be used to generate FOMs and SOMs from BOM compositions.Command, Control, Communication, Computers, Intelligence Surveillance & Reconnaissance/Simulation Interoperability Technical Reference Model (C4ISR/SIM TRM PDG)U.S. and international military communities have identified interoperability between C4ISR and M&S systems as a high priority.  This is reflected in the Army M&S Master Plan, the Air Force Distributed Mission Operations goals, the Navy and Marine Corps Aviation Simulation Master Plans, the Joint National Training Capability objectives, the DoD Training Transformation goals, and the NATO Modelling and Simulation Master Plan.Work is under way to address the myriad of issues related to interoperability.  Issues range from coalescing an assortment of systems models to identifying levels of interoperability.  Issues are further complicated by the variety of C4ISR and Simulation systems, and the often dissimilar needs of legacy, interim, and future applications.  The desire to satisfy both near- and far-term interoperability requirements poses a challenge when attempting to develop a solution for a specific application.  The proposed product will provide guidance on these issues for all those involved in the development process (management, procurement, engineering, end-user, etc.). It will serve as a tutorial for those new to the field, establish a common vocabulary, and provide visibility into the work being done by others.Commercial Off-the-Shelf Simulation Package Interoperability (CSPI PDG)Since 1980 efforts to improve the productivity of simulation modeling in manufacturing have yielded the range of COTS discrete event simulation packages (CSPs) that are used today by engineers and analysts to investigate complex, dynamic process-based systems found in commerce, health, manufacturing and supply chains.  It is true that there are many different types of system that might be called COTS packages.  However, this work concerns itself with systems that fall under the discrete event simulation paradigm, i.e. simulated models of systems that change state at discrete points in time (scheduled events) or as a result of state changes (conditional events).  These state changes typically represent entities  (documents, patients, parts, trains, etc.) that pass through networks of queues and workstations (work queuing at a desk in an office, patients waiting to see a doctor, parts buffered for machining, trains waiting at a station, etc.)  CSPs support activities such as model building, experimentation, animation, visualization and reporting.  There are currently around 20 of these commercially available .It is important to note that the model/CSP technology is a fixed point.  Virtually every engineering faculty has some course on simulation modeling that uses one or more CSPs.  Engineers and analysts use these CSPs to build and maintain simulation models.  These CSPs therefore represent a significant investment.  Additionally, users of these CSPs are not software engineers – they are simulation modelers.  There is evidence to show that it is highly likely that any major changes to their methodology and technologies will result in the non-adoption of these proposed products.  It is therefore a major consideration of our work that any interoperability products that are developed are highly transparent in nature.Core Manufacturing Simulation Data (CMSD PDG)This product defines a data interface specification for efficient exchange of manufacturing life cycle data in a simulation environment.  The specification provides neutral data interfaces for integrating manufacturing software applications with simulation systems.  The initial effort is focusing on machine shop data definitions.  The plan is to extend the data specification to include supply chain, aerospace assembly operations, automotive vehicle assembly operations, plant layout, and other relevant manufacturing and simulation information.This standard effort is to promote the increased, widespread, and pervasive use of advanced manufacturing technologies, in particular, the simulation technology in the manufacturing industries. The effort will benefit not only the manufacturing industry worldwide, but more specifically it will benefit the Modeling and Simulation community in the near term.Distributed Interactive Simulation Extension (DIS PDG)The DIS PDG is investigating the present use of Protocol Data Units (PDUs), which are the basis for communicating information among simulations under the DIS (IEEE 1278) standards. Many times, the use of PDUs requires users to select values for certain fields to identify the specific use of the PDUs in that event. Many users have also created "experimental PDUs" to serve their application needs.  The DIS SG will review new DIS PDUs for applicability and usefulness to the M&S community. Also, DIS users have expressed a need to clarify and interpret the existing DIS Standard(s). This includes HLA users of DIS PDUs. Users are invited to participate, both on the DIS SG Reflector and at upcoming SIWs. Please contribute a description of any experimental PDUs that you have developed and value assignments that you have made to existing DIS PDUs.Dynamic Link Compatible High Level Architecture Application Programming Interface (HLA API PDG)The HLA API PDG is developing a standard to define the requirements for Dynamic Link Compatible HLA APIs and methods for testing compliance.  This standard will be very useful to the distributed simulation community that uses the HLA and particularly useful to simulation developers that have to participate in multiple Federations sing different RTIs.  Use of the Dynamic Link Compatible HLA APIs will also support Federation managers in assembling Federates.  The PDG plans to define standard C++ and Java APIs for HLA 1.3 which will be based on the current APIs.  Additionally, alternative C++ and Java APIs will be created for the IEEE 1516.1 APIs will be a SISO extension to the IEEE standard.Environmental Data Coding Specification (EDCS PDG)EDCS is a component of the Synthetic Environment Data Representation Interchange Specification (SEDRIS) that provides a data dictionary and coding standard for environmental data used in simulations of terrain, atmosphere, ocean, and space.High Level Architecture Evolved (HLA Evolved PDG)The HLA Evolved PDG will implement a set of changes to the original IEEE 1516 series of High Level Architecture (HLA) standards based upon the evolving needs and requirements of the  current HLA user community. The documents to be updated via the work covered by this Product Nomination (PN) are:IEEE Std 1516-2000 RulesIEEE Std 1516.1-2000 Federate Interface Specification IEEE Std 1516.2-2000 Object Model Template (OMT)Collectively, these existing documents will be called 1516-2000. Note that IEEE Std 1516.3-2003 (HLA Federation Development and Execution Process) will not be included in this effort.Link-16 Simulation Standard (Link-16 PDG)Link 16 is one of the critical components of interoperability in the Allied forces.  There are immediate and overdue operational requirements for existing and future military simulations to exchange Link-16 data using a single interoperable standard. This group is developing a SISO standard to define the methods to simulate a Link-16 Network within Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) and High Level Architecture (HLA) frameworks.Real-time Platform Reference Federation Object Model (RPR FOM PDG)Version 1.0 of this Reference Federation Object Model was the first SISO standard, capturing the functionality of IEEE 1278.1-1995.  RPR FOM 2.0, currently under development, will add the functionality of IEEE 1278.1a-1998.Verification, Validation, & Accreditation Overlay to Federation Development (VV&A PDG)The VV&A PDG is developing a recommended practices guide outlining implementation methodologies for the VV&A of a federation.  IEEE 1516.3, Recommended Practices for HLA Federation Development and Execution Process (FEDEP) recognized VV&A as a key component of federation development and implementation to the extent that placeholders, or "hooks," were included in the FEDEP to support the development of a VV&A overlay.  The proposed VV&A guidance document will mirror the FEDEP, addressing overall VV&A methodology, roles and responsibilities, tasks, and resulting products.  It will be based on lessons learned and established approaches derived from the M&S community.  This guidance document will serve as the foundation for the assessment of credibility of a federation by addressing issues relating to establishing substantive interoperability, promoting reusability, and assuring composability.TECHNICAL EXHIBITS AND DEMONSTRATIONSThroughout the week, several organizations will provide exhibits and demonstrations of materials, software, and equipment relevant to distributed simulation applications.
