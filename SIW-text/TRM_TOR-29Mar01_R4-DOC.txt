(DRAFT)Terms of Reference (TOR)forM&S-to-C4IC4ISR/Sim Interoperability Technical Reference ModelStudy Group(TRM SG)  (Draft) Rationale The Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Modeling and Simulation (C4ISR M&S) community has called for a Technical Reference Model (TRM) to create a standard frame of reference for interoperability between C4ISR Command, Control, Computer, Communications, Computer, and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance  (C4ISR) Systems and M&S Modeling and Simulation Systems.  This Study Group (SG) attempts towill answer that call by creatingprototyping a conceptual technical model that can be used to describe as well as to measurecategorize the level of interoperability of systems or classes of systems.  By design, the TRM will facilitate analysis of requirements, architecture, design, implementation,  and  testingand testing of large-scaleheterogenousheterogeneous systems.  In addition, the TRM will support improved  dialogue betweenamong users, developers,  and among technicians in the C4ISR community.AudienceThe TRM is intended for both the M&S and C4ISR communities, including users, developers and technicians.  The TRM is also intended to address the international community as well as national, state, and local government, and service communities.Background StatementOne of the purposes of the SISO [1013] is to promote the interface standardization of interoperable simulations across the M&S community.  Through the Simulation Interoperability Workshops (SIW), SISO provides a forum for the interchange of new ideas, concepts, and technology across a broad M&S community and lays the groundwork for subsequent standards development.  One of the mechanisms for development of these standards is a SG.  SGs are designed to provide an environment for the development of products that support the interoperability and reuse of distributed simulation [1013].In the “Report Out of the C4IC4I Study Group” at the Fall 2000 SIW  [1114] the C4IC4I Study Group (C4I-SG) determined the need for a standard frame of reference, in the form of a TRM, for interoperability between C4IC4ISR Systems M&S Systems.  This C4IC4ISR to M&S (C4IC4ISR/M&S) TRM should be a conceptual technical model that can be used to measure the level of interoperability of systems or classes of systems, and would be based on existing work  already performed [2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 129, 1114],.  The C4IC4I-SG recommended the formation of a SG to develop this C4IC4ISR/M&S TRM as a formal SISOstandardized product.The C4IC4ISR Study Group report cited the need to extend the C4IC4ISR/M&S TRM, particularly the addition of a fourth broad data class; Metadata.  The C4IC4ISR Study Group also requested consideration of how the C4IC4ISR/M&S TRM would relate to other interoperability models]  and the NATO Computer Information Systems Best Practices Guide [12]. The C4I/M&S TRM could be an extension the LISI model or the DoD TRM to develop C4I to M&S interoperability.Tasks1.  Research C4I frameworks (to include the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Combat Information SystemC3 Technical Architecture (NC3TA)), US Department of Defense (DoD) TRM, the US Federal TRM, Levels of Information Systems Interoperability (LISI) as well as Partnership for Peace (PfP) issues and other relevant technical frameworks) (CIS) Best Practices to form a basis for analysis, definition, and development of a C4ISR-to-Simulation (C4ISR-to-/Sim) TRM.2.  Analyze and modify the current C4IC4ISR//M&SSim TRM, identified in the C4IC4ISR Study Group Report [1114].  Expand to ensure consistency and completeness across joint and coalition military organizations.3.  Develop sample implementationsuse cases of the C4IC4ISR/M&SSim TRM using existing C4ISR frameworks such as the Defense Information Infrastructure Common Operating Environment (DII COE) as well as and NATO and/or Partners for Peace C4IC4ISR. 4.  Deliver a report with a finalized C4IC4ISR/M&SSim TRM and a recommendation regarding its acceptance as a formal SISO product.   with examplesWithin the report, the TRM SG will provide and examples of applications; recommendations of on future uses of the model; an assessment of the suitability of incorporating the TRM into specific for acceptance as a Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization (SISO) Guidance Products; and identify areas for development of supporting processes, tools, or products; and s.uggest areas of possible expansion of the TRM. ProductsAn In-Progress Review (IPR) on the TRM will be presented as a paper in the FallSpring 2001 SIW paper.  The Spring 2001 FPR will consist of a guidance product with two parts: 1) a description of the basic model, and 2) implementation application of the model in C4ISR domains.   (to be presented as one or a multiple of SIW papers).  Additional reports containing research results using the basic model may also be developed.  The TRM SG will produce additional intermediate products as appropriate. Some of these reports may be in the form of SIW papers, authored by subgroups of the PDG, or other materials or products.  Our intent is to develop this TRM as the basis for a Guidance Product to be proposed the following year.  Performance PeriodThe SG shall begin work after the Spring 2001 Simulation Interoperability Workshop (SIW).  The SG shall complete work and submit a Final Product Report (FPR) to the SISO Standards Activity Committee by the Spring 2002 SIW.  The SG shall submit an Interim Product Report (IPR) at the Fall 2001 SIW.  General TRM SG membershipTRM SG membership/participation is open to all who wish to contribute to the C4I/Sim TRM SG endeavor.  A reflector (SIW-ISG-C4I) has been established for the SG-C4I at the SIW website.  The  A reflector will remain open be established at the SIW website  for SG use.  All interested individuals are welcome to join the group by subscribing to the reflector.MilestonesMarch 2001 		- Organizational Meeting for SG at SISOMay 2001 		- SG Kick-off MeetingJune 2001  		- Presentation of SG at CCRTSJune 2001 		- Presentation of SG at Euro SIW June 2001 		- SG MeetingSeptember 2001	- Interim Product Report on SGSeptember 2001 	- SG Meeting at SIWSeptember 2001 	- Initial TRM Product DevelopedNovember 2001 	- SG MeetingNovember 2001 	- Initial TRM Product ReviewedDecember 2001 	- SG MeetingDecember 2001 	- Final TRM ProductJanuary 2002 		- Begin preparation of C4I to Sim TRM     PDG Product Nomination (PN)                      		- Assemble balloting pool for future guidance productFebruary 2002 	- SG MeetingFebruary 2002 	- Final TRM Product ReviewedMarch 2002 		- Final Product Reportguidance or reference C4ISR-to-Sim TRM SG Process and Administration1.
