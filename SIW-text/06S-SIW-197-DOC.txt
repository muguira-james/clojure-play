SUBJECT: Simulation Reference Markup Language (SRML) Product Development Group (PDG) Kick-off MeetingSpring 2006 Simulation Interoperability Workshop (SIW), Huntsville, AL04 April 2006, 1330-1700 Central 1. ATTENDEES:(a) PDG members: Bob Lutz (Chair), Jane Bachman (Vice Chair/Technical Area Director (TAD)),	Curtis Blais (Secretary), Paul Gustavson, Tram Chase, George Hughes, Larry Root, Bryan Linkous, Ben Sisson, Andreas Tolk, and Katherine Morse.(b) DG members: Steve Reichenthal (Drafting Group Editor)Total:  12 participants. 2. TOPICS:Steve Reichenthal welcomed everyone to the kick-off meeting of the Simulation Reference Markup Language (SRML) PDG.We proceeded to elect the Chair and Vice Chair.  Bob Lutz self-nominated as Chair, Paul Gustavson seconded, and was approved by attendees. Jane Bachman self-nominated as Vice Chair, Paul Gustavson seconded and was approved by attendees. Secretary is postponed to later in the meeting. Jane filled-in by capturing minutes until that time. Jane is the Standards Advisory Council (SAC) Technical Area Director (TAD) assigned to the PDG.Steve described the SRML history and the domain representation evolution. He provided a brief on SRML, with examples of SRML use that are available in the download package.Steve introduced Katherine Morse as an invited speaker.  She presented a brief on M&S Tools in the Defense Modeling and Simulation Office (DMSO).Steve introduced Andreas Tolk as the next invited speaker.  He spoke on Contribution to the SRML PDG: Reference Implementation for M&S in the Global Information Grid (GIG) Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA).Adjourned briefly for the SIW break time.Steve introduced Paul Gustavson as an invited speaker.  Paul briefed on Base Object Models (BOMs), SRML and support for Model Development Architecture. He provided side-by-side comparison of BOM and SRML technologies.Discussed putting together a paper for the Fall 2006 SIW describing the design of a demonstration of the various XML-based standards efforts occurring in SISO, including the Military Scenario Definition Language (MSDL) and Coalition Battle Management Language (C-BML). Also pertinent would be web service implementations of the Command and Control Information Exchange Data Model (C2IEDM) by Andreas Tolk and others at Old Dominion University (ODU) Virginia Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation Center (VMASC), and Extensible 3D (X3D) graphics efforts at the Naval Postgraduate School. An architecture diagram needs to be attempted that would describe how the various techniques would work together, from composing BOMs, to describing a scenario, to execution, to visualization. Would lead to a paper and demonstration for the Spring 2007 SIW in Norfolk.Steve explained the current status of the language documentation. A tutorial exists and serve as an initial draft of the guidance document.  Documentation for the SRML simulation engine Application Program Interface (API) exists.Content of these three documents would be a good baseline. It would need to be put in SISO document format.Proposed a plan to use the Fall SIW has a means to adjudicate a first round of comments.  The reflector will be used to discuss the details.  A separate list will be created for the PDG drafting group and the officers for coordination of development efforts. The drafting group will be selected by Steve as Drafting Group (DG) Lead Editor.The URL to the SRML download, with the documentation and example files, is  HYPERLINK "http://www.boeing.com/assocproducts/srml" http://www.boeing.com/assocproducts/srml. Steve will post this to the SRML Study Group reflector.Curtis Blais self-nominated as Secretary, Larry seconded and all approved.Paul nominated Steve Reichenthal as Drafting Group Editor and Larry seconded.  All approved.  The PDG Chair and TAD will forward the nomination to the SAC.SRML PDG adjourned.3.
