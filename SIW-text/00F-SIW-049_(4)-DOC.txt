These range from “data-oriented” solutions, which impose “least common denominator” performance standards, to “display-oriented” solutions, which focus on the disparate effects of differing representations of the same objects. During the Army’s Battle Command Reengineering IV experiment, conducted from Monday, April 10 through Wednesday, April 19, 2000, the CECOM Night Vision and Electronics Sensors Directorate (NVESD) “Paint the Night” (PTN) system was used to simulate sensor systems used by a maneuver squadron to perform reconnaissance functions in a virtual environment. BCR IV OverviewIn BCR IV, Paint the Night, a high-resolution engineering level sensor simulation, was integrated into the exercise from a remote site at CECOM NVESD at Fort Belvoir, using an ATM backplane over Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN) OC-3 lines. Federate components of the sensor simulation, used an HLA federation in which the controls and displays located at Ft. Knox communicated sensor state and viewing direction to synthetic image generator and sensor effects federates at Ft. Belvoir. The Ft. Belvoir federates then transmitted high resolution synthetic sensor imagery back to the Ft. Knox simulation in real-time. The purposes of BCR IV were: to examine the effects of digitized command and control at brigade and lower levels of command and to develop more effective tactical operations centers. Integral to the BCR IV concept were a common-database command and control system, video-teleconference white-board capability, robotic unmanned air and ground platforms with advanced sensor packages, and uplinks to synthetic aperture radar and satellite imagery. BCR IV provided the warfighter a comprehensive environment in which to assess these information management, work flow, and overload issues in a synthetic battlespace capable of stimulating battle communications, staff planning and command decisions. ModSAF was extensively used to represent the C4ISR and combat capability of a futuristic, “digitized battalion task force; the virtual component was limited to six re-configurable man-in-the-loop simulators representing a future scout platoon armed with futuristic sensors, robotic platforms, and communications equipment. The “Paint the Night” sensor simulation was configured to operate with the platoon leader or platoon sergeant’s simulator, which had three additional display monitors in the commander and mission specialist compartment. One monitor (with touch screen/controls) was used for fire control), a second monitor (also with touch screen/controls) was used for the sensor view, and a third monitor was used for a plan view display of ModSAF.  This simulator was connected to the Ft. Knox exercise network through DIS, and to the Paint the Night HLA federation through the ATM network, using a DIS to HLA converter. Throughout BCR IV, Paint the Night provided the scout platoon a representation of onboard sensors as well as remote sensor feeds to unmanned aerial and ground vehicles. One of the advanced electro-optical sensors planned for use on these systems is the Long Range Advanced Scout Surveillance System (LRAS3). In the LRAS3 configuration, the Paint the Night sensor simulation represents Common Aperture Optics (Narrow and Medium Fields of View) with a 2nd Generation. B-Kit LongWave Scanning FLIR, an optional Day TV view, a Laser Range Finder (Far Target Locator), and Global Positioning System downlink.Terrain  and Feature GenerationThe Synthetic Environment for BCR IV represented an area around Tuzla, Bosnia. The exercise playbox was approximately 180 by 130 kilometers consisting of mountains and forests with narrow maneuver corridors in the river valleys. National Imagery Mapping Agency (NIMA) elevation and feature data was available to support Daytime Out the Window, IR sensor, and ModSAF database builds.  Available source data included DTED Level II, Interim Terrain Data (ITD) and ARC Digitized Raster Graphic (ADRG) 1:50,000 scale image maps. The S1000 database used by the OTW and ModSAF applications had been built in 1998, whereas the PTN sensor database was built from the NIMA source products to support BCR IV.Figure 1 PTN Sensor Database Build ProcessPTN EO/IR Sensor DatabasePTN uses SGI Performer Fast Binary (.PFB) runtime database format for scene rendering.  In the BCR IV effort, the EO/IR scene database consisted of PFB files representing the following terrain objects:The terrain skin, represented as T-Mesh strips derived from DTED Level II source with no thinning and three levels of detail. The terrain PFB files are tiled as powers of two with respect to the resolution of the gridded elevation source data. For the BCR IV Tuzla project, this resulted in a 9 x 9 km tile size. Roads are extracted from ADRG files, converted to 2D vectors, then 3D polygons, and stored as a separate PFB file.Cultural models (e.g. trees, powerlines, likewise stored as separate .PFB files loaded into Performer. The Paint the Night visual database included about 15 million trees, representing roughly half the database size. Figure 1. describes the PTN terrain build process from source data processing to runtime formatting. As a minimum, this process requires a digital elevation model to support terrain skinning, and an orthorectified image from which features may be extracted. When geospecific imagery is not available, feature data may be extracted from such standard NIMA raster and vector source products as ITD, VPF, VMAP, or ADRG. In BCR IV, the PTN team used ADRG in lieu of orthorectified imagery to extract features as a raster map, which was used as a basis for roads and forested areas. Road data is converted from raster to vector representation prior to polygonization, with no thinning or generalizationIn the PTN terrain build process, the elevation data is “flattened” underneath the road surfaces, a process analogous to “cut-in” features in an integrated TIN surface representation, so that road heights “float” above the terrain within a 6-9 cm tolerance. For point features, such as trees, individual x,y locations are extracted from the raster data, vectorized as single point references and associated with the appropriate 3D models, which are then “planted” on the terrain surface. In the BCR IV Tuzla project, vegetation color values were first extracted from the ADRG source data, and individual raster locations extracted randomly, according to a specified density parameter.The PTN database is partitioned both spatially and thematically, in the manner of a 3D GIS database. The PTN database pager, which was first introduced to support BCR IV, used this tiling scheme to process the 23,400 square kilometer BCR IV footprint. As with the corresponding S1000 dataset, The PTN database uses an internal local cartesian coordinate system with the database origin defined as x,y,z = 0,0, height above mean sea level. This database origin is associated with a UTM coordinate offset, which serves as a point of reference for coordinate transformations among HLA federates and the HLA-DIS gateway. Both the PTN and S1000 databases have extended UTM Zone 34 extended west in Zone 33, where the SW corner lies, since roughly 2/3 of the database lies in UTM Zone 34.As in other PTN terrain database builds, ModSAF format 7 terrain has been built from the PTN terrain process. . While this data set was not used to support BCR IV itself, it was used to assist in correlation studies associated with this paper.Daytime Out-The Window  Visuals The Daytime OTW visual databases used by various image generation environments – the Reconfigurable Scout Simulator and “Stealth” viewers – were created by the US Army Topographic Engineering Center in 1998 under US Army Air Maneuver Battle Lab sponsorship. This visual database was generated using ARC/INFO and S1000 tools, and disseminated in FLT and native S1000 formats (The Reconfigurable Scout Simulator uses a Performer S1000 database loader to render the S1000 visuals.) to support runtime visual simulation.According to [1], the source data used to process the S1000 database were:DTED Level IINIMA topographic line maps at 1:50,000 and 1:100,000 scaleInferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar imageryCollateral PhotographyLegacy S1000 modelsControlled Image Base (CIB) (5 meter pixel resolution)Planning Interim Terrain Data (PITD), a lower resolution form of ITD vector dataThe CIB image data was used to upgrade and edit the transportation features, however, any features left out of the PITD coverages were not digitized as part of the NE Bosnia project. Some feature generalization was performed on all layers in ARC/INFO. Areal features exceeding 10,000 square meters were eliminated. Vector features were imported into S1000 as overlays in ADDWAMS/MOSS format, and /or passed into the “FastITIN” tool for integration with the terrain skin. The terrain skin was produced as a triangulated irregular network (TIN) with cut-in features representing roads and water bodies. However, it should be noted that some secondary roads were decaled onto the terrain surface, rather than cut-in to the TIN. Forested areas were represented as canopy structures that replicated the Delauney triangulated terrain surface, elevated above the surface to represent tree height, and bounded on the edges by “treeline” components of the canopy representing the edge of the forested area. However, these forested areas generally made little use of individual trees to reflect the internal geometry of the vegetation, with the accompanying impact on line of sight and mobility calculations in the runtime simulation. Moreover, according to [1} the vast dimensions of the Bosnia forests represented a challenge for the S1000 canopy triangulation algorithms, which required an upper limit of 25,000 square kilometers to be placed on overlay features used to generate canopy forests.  Significant terrain relaxation, often reducing 500x500 meter load modules to 2 triangle sets, was placed on the terrain in some large forested areas. Built up areas were populated thinly with 3D models, in order to reduce polygon count in these areas. Table 1 describes features which were included in the integrated TIN generation process (e.g. in FastITIN) versus features which were triangulated in S1000. As with the PTN visual database, the S1000 data was triangulated surface in local cartesian space with a UTM offset, extending UTM Zone 34 extended west into Zone 33.Layers Not TinnedTinned LayersLinear HydrologyMain Roads (all hard surface, some loose surface)RailroadsAreal hydrology (Large rivers, lakes)Minor RoadsAirfieldsPower LinesVegetationTable 1: Feature Representation in S1000 NE Bosnia Database from [1]ModSAF TerrainThe ModSAF terrain used during BCR IV was derived from the same S1000 source as the daytime visuals, ensuring close correlation of geometry and attribution between CGF and visual databases. During the preparations for BCR IV, PTN engineers extracted road data from ModSAF .ctdb files to assist in visual comparison and correlation analysis. This was done in response to initial observations of vehicle/position miscorrelation in ModSAF when following roads with PTN sensor views. Interoperability IssuesAs the BCR IV experience shows, PTN supports higher resolution elevation and feature content than many legacy simulators, including the standard daytime visual systems used in the reconfigurable scout simulators. However, to support the BCR IV simulation environment, it was necessary to interoperate with these lower resolution displays, including “Out-the-Window” (e.g. Stealth and fire control optics) displays, and with ModSAF.  As with previous DIS and HLA exercises, coordinate transformation among various federates required our attention. In terms of the Paint the Night Simulation, this meant converting ModSAF-generated Entity State PDUs in geocentric coordinates across a DIS to HLA gateway into the PST Federations internal coordinate system, the local cartesian system previously described. The PTN DIS/HLA gateway uses a database-specific reference file (coord.cfg) to specify the sensor database origin in UTM coordinates, with an ellipsoid reference (e.g. WGS 84) to ensure accurate coordinate transformations. This process is quite compatible with the UTM and GCS coordinate representations in ModSAF terrain, with the reservation that PTN does not currently support GCS directly. This may induce minor spatial miscorrelation in large PTN databases that must interoperate with GCS terrain representations. (The issue of scaleability of PTN terrain in its native local cartesian system lies beyond the scope of this paper.)Clearly, when two terrain databases must interoperate using different terrain skins, that miscorrelation may result in anomalous behavior, unless the image generators impose ground clamping. This was the expedient used in PTN to support BCR IV. Two potential drawbacks to ground clamping are:Computational load imposed on the image generatorPotential for unfair fight between shooter and target vehiclesIn the best case, therefore, all terrain and feature geometry should be identical. But is better the enemy of good enough ? Are there cases where some inconsistency in terrain and feature geometry may be tolerated, and still offer valid results for training and even combat developments testing ? In examining this problem, therefore, we are distinguishing between the consistency and the credibility of a distributed simulation. For example, 1000 meter engagement between tanks in the midst of a canopy with no internal trees may be consistent, but it is not credible. Another example of a consistent interaction which is not credible is an ATGM missile launched by one federate (and has been calculated according to that federate’s hit probability to have struck the target, which is “flown out” on the 3D view of victim’s federate so that it flies “around” an obstruction, such as a building (This is most likely to happen when the target is moving, and there is lag or latency slowing down the federation’s interactions. Unfair direct fire engagements may or may not be credible, depending on the degree of perceived terrain correlation in conjunction with the dead reckoning models in the 3D view. However, if there is a significant overmatch between the sensor capabilities of one force over the other, such that Blue’s long range sensor views exceed the capacity of Red, it is possible to characterize the resulting interactions as both credible and consistent.The soldier feedback from BCR IV seems to indicate that such situations may arise, under the following general conditions:The exercise is not heavily populated with visual and electro optical views. It is helpful to remember in this context that virtual distributed simulations are grounded on perceived reality, rather than absolute ground truth, in the runtime infrastructure. Higher resolution views of the virtual battlespace are used for sensing rather than shooting. Thus, we agree that “peer shooters” (e.g. tank against tank) that operate in the same onboard optical and electro optical sensor envelopes need to have the same (or at least, equivalent) terrain geometry, and to some extent, the same attribution. Landmarks, including key cultural features, are compatible, if not identically represented. We assume here that soldiers and crews will use their individual views to collaborate and coordinate their actions, and therefore need common points of reference.It is also worth noting that runtime simulations should have compatible mobility models. In BCR, the primary mobility model was afforded by ModSAF, and secondarily, by the virtual scout simulators. While PTN sensor databases do not necessarily contain mobility-specific information, we are aware that, in cases where ModSAF terrain is produced through the PTN terrain build process, it is necessary to provide information to support ModSAF polygon attribute table structures, which may vary across federations and applications.Measurement of CorrelationDifferences – Theory and PracticeIn the BCR IV exercise, it was necessary to reconsider the question of how correlation should be measured and evaluated in the context of a distributed simulation exercise in which alternative terrain database representations were being used. While correlation of visual and IR sensor views used for aircraft simulation has been considered a requirement, virtual simulation of ground forces and sensors imposes a variety of fidelity demands not encountered in flight simulation. This pertains especially to the encoding and appearance of cultural features in the runtime terrain databases and to the impact of both the terrain skin and near-ground feature geometry on intervisibility calculations. Consequently, the impact of features, especially vegetation and transportation layers, on terrain appreciation, land navigation, targeting and target coordination, and situational awareness served to focus our data collection and analysis.Road ExampleJust prior to BCR IV, PTN engineers examined the correlation of PTN roads to ModSAF. Initial impressions formed by attempting to compare the 3D visuals in PTN to ModSAF road behaviors tended to indicate significant disparities, perhaps up to 100 meter deviations between S1000 and PTN. At one point, road vectors were extracted from ModSAF for the purpose of using the S1000 data in lieu of PTN roads. Concurrently with that effort, the PTN staff placed ModSAF vehicles at selected crossroads and bridge locations, in order to systematically determine the extent of miscorrelation. The final results of this analysis are given in Tables 2 and 3 below.ID#FeatureUTM (TEC DB)UTM (PTN DB)Diff (meters)1065Bridge0269659 49603690269659 49603690.00001061Bridge0270845 49973570270845 49973552.00001035Bridge0275841 49560720275835 49560799.21951062Bridge0269794 49566550269793 49566532.23611064Bridge0267734 49543960267739 49543955.09901063Bridge0268763 49551520268759 49551534.12311055Bridge0284232 49522900284233 49522873.16231044Crossroads0264915 49578960264914 49578951.41421043Crossroads0266052 49603150266055 49603124.24261046Crossroads0269436 49597290269434 49597302.23611076Crossroads0268980 49575350268980 49575350.00001073Crossroads0270214 49571880270217 49571854.24261041Crossroads0269307 49652570269302 49652575.00001042Crossroads0275450 49632080275454 49632074.12311038Crossroads0275819 49561050275817 49561032.82841072Crossroads0269963 49566010269963 49566010.00001034Crossroads0275847 49594690275847 49594690.00001033Crossroads0277212 49538430277219 49538509.89951075Crossroads0269523 49568780269523 49568780.00001074Crossroads0269705 49566900269705 49566900.00001066Crossroads0269074 49547920269076 49547902.82841069Crossroads0267398 49539000267406 49539059.43401058Crossroads0283846 49521070283834 495211213.00001054Crossroads0283932 49520440283928 49520507.2111Table 2: Key Transportation Layer Samples in BCR IV Scenario AreaThis data tends to minimize the extent of road miscorrelation between the two databases, in most cases, not even amounting to the half width of the roads themselves. Considering that the source data, thinning strategies, and visual database densities of the respective PTN and S1000 databases were quite different, one might have expected a greater average difference. However, we shall also note the following mitigating factors that maximized correlation across the sample population:Even though the S1000 source data was PITD extracted from 1:250,000 scale cartosource, it was edited In ARC/INFO using Controlled Image Base (CIB) as background imagery to register the trace of the roads at key locations, including bridges.The CIB imagery resolution was 5 meters per pixel.Secondary roads, which were present in PTN, but not present in the S1000/PITD source data, were not evaluated.Thus, even though the apparent visual anomalies resulting from running these two databases simultaneously may have been few, the sampling method tends to understate the miscorrelation of the two respective databases.Correlation Measures: Transportation FeaturesX YX,YSum of Differences: Crossroads and Bridges70.00052.00092.300Average Difference: Crossroads and Bridges2.9172.1673.846Standard Deviation: Crossroads and Bridges3.0272.2303.542Sum of Dfferences: Bridge locations17.00016.00025.840Average Difference:  Bridges (7 samples)2.4292.2863.691Standard Deviation of Bridge locations 2.3212.1192.715Sum of Differences: Crossroads53.00036.00066.460Average Difference: Crossroads (17 samples)3.1182.1183.909Standard Deviation of Crossroad locations3.2522.2723.829Table 3: Statistical Analysis of Sampled Transportation LayerForest ExampleAnalysis of the impact of the forest representation was done using the ModSAF intervisibility tools, against the respective S1000 and PTN datasets. As Figure 2 illustrates, there are subtle but significant differences between the two datasets, when a likely sensor position’s field of view is evaluated with respect to cover, concealment, and likely avenues of approach. The representation of the forested areas as individual trees, rather than generalized canopies (here again, derived from PITD generalized to eliminated all vegetated areas in excess of 10,000 square meters) results in more realistic portrayal of visual and electro optical sensor views, as well as dead space resulting from obstructing foliage.Figure 2: Side by Side Intervisibility Comparison – S1000 (Left), PTN (Right)b. Performance IssuesAgainst this backdrop of differing terrain database content the respective performance envelopes of the visual, IR, and ModSAF systems should be considered. Table 4 below summarizes this comparison. Notable therein are the larger database storage requirements of PTN databases, which heighten the need for database paging, in both visual and nonvisual runtime simulations. In terms of ModSAF and other similar applications that use libctdb, this generally requires sufficient RAM to read the database into memory. While RAM and online storage is becoming progressively cheaper, this remains a consideration for both legacy and newer, PC-based Linux desktop systems. PTN (IR)S1000 (Daytime OTW)3D VisualsPolygon Throughput150K polygons @ 30 Hz50K polygons @ 30 HzPolygon OptimizationAvg 66 pts (64 poly tmesh) per primitiveAvg 4pts (Quad) per polyIsect OptimizationLOS & terrain I-sects cheap(Look-up table)LOS & terrain I-sects costly(Search all triangles in cell)Terrain ContentNo thinning of vector source(roads, vegetation)	 CTDB can be compiled from visualThinned roadsCanopy/tree line forestsA few individual treesCTDB can be compiled from visualModSAFModSAF TDB Memory 250-500 MB (Tuzla Database)~ 40 MB (NE Bosnia Database)Driving BehaviorLittle or no impact due to denser roadsDense forests can block movement, cause anomalous drivingCut in features can cause driving anomalies if too steep (slope data compensates for this)“SAF” traps in concave canopiesIntervisibilityGridded terrain surface improves efficiency of IV calculationsTree geometry part of patch group lookupCanopy geometry and microterrain surface part of patch group lookupTable 4: A Performance Comparison of BCR IV SystemsConclusionsThe question remains: How much interoperability is enough ? While the coexistence of visual, IR and ModSAF runtime databases that had different, albeit “authoritative” NIMA source data, different thinning strategies, and varying runtime performance parameters. How does one validate competing terrain representations in source, interchange, and runtime databases ? While visual comparison of terrain provides useful contextual information, it is insufficient for the purpose of diagnosing the extent of miscorrelation. Our experience indicates that there is a continuing need to define correlation measures and to improve the tools available to measure database differences. Such analyses should distinguish between:Source dataInterchange data/mechanismsRuntime databases These analyses should attempt to discover processes that tend to increase or decrease correlation. For example, the use of similar spatial reference frames does simplify correlation analysis. As our experience implies, the use of “authoritative sources” guarantees neither correlation of runtime databases, nor adequate runtime optimization and synchronization among federates. In this sense, we contend that no runtime database, and probably, no interchange database is “authoritative”. While in the future, thinning will not be necessary in visual simulation, this is still not the state of the art for most simulation applications.While it proved necessary for Paint the Night to employ ground clamping to accommodate differences between the ModSAF terrain and PTN terrain, a high degree of visual fidelity and functional interoperablity among simulations was otherwise achieved, and “fair fight” issues did not arise due to lack of full terrain correlation between PTN, other 3D visual systems, and ModSAF. This resulted in part from the fact that the PTN sensor simulation role was limited to reconnaissance and surveillance tasks. As HLA implementations expand into increasingly composable federates, and as runtime terrain databases become increasingly tailored to their runtime simulation applications, we expect that the potential for interoperability among multiresolution applications will increase across a common synthetic environment.References [1] U.S. Army Topographic Engineering Center, “Terrain Database Specification: Operation Joint Endeavor, Northeast Bosnia Terrain Simulation Database” January 1999.[2] Lorenzo, M.
