The intent of the initiative is to reduce the time, resources and risk associated with acquisition, enable the integrated product and process development (IPPD) and improve the quality of the fielded product. Simulation Based Acquisition is not a program in its own right but provides an overarching framework within which each of the stakeholders in the process begin to communicate in ways that allow for tailored implementation to meet the technical needs of the domain and reflect the distinctive corporate culture.   This paper presents not only a background of SBA, but also identifies the actions that have occurred since the Fall 2000 Simulation Interoperability Workshop, and provides an Office of the Secretary of Defense perspective on implementing SBA. The realization of SBA will require advances in M&S technologies and standards.IntroductionIn the Darwinian theory of evolution, organisms adapt or perish when faced with changing environments.  During gradual changes, most organisms adapt through the process of natural selection, favoring those genetic characteristics that enhance performance most favorably in the newer conditions. However, when faced with rapid or cataclysmic change, it becomes a matter of survival of the fittest: those species that are well-suited to the new environmental conditions survive and florish, while those that can not vanish. Adaptation across generations is non-responsive to the magnitude of the change and its cycle.  Over the past four years, the Defense Acquisition Community (both industry and government) has been working towards a vision called Simulation Based Acquisition (SBA) (see figure 1). In a sense, a few key characteristics in the environment are pacing the advance from motivation to implementation. In the early to mid-1990s, cost-performance considerations made the routine use of computers, models and simulations, and information technology tools economically feasible within a large number of engineering and management domains. A new class of acquisition programs began to incorporate, to a significantly greater degree, the use of modeling & simulation and 3-D solid modeling software as key elements of their acquisition and business strategies. In 1996–1997, the Defense Department's senior acquisition functional area leadership championed corporate initiatives like the Simulation Test & Evaluation Plan (STEP), Simulation Based Acquisition (SBA), and later the concepts of Evolutionary Acquisition and Spiral Development. The acquisition environment was rapidly changing and the program managers, in order to survive and thrive, needed to know what "tactics, techniques, and procedures" would help their programs develop and deliver affordable system solutions that meet the warfighters' needs.Situation Report NeededOne of the original principal motivators for the SBA initiative was to improve the responsiveness of the overall acquisition system.  Therefore, providing all stakeholders with an understanding of where we are as a community, what has and is working for practitioners in government and industry, and where to go for more information about this evolution/revolution should significantly improve the odds for their program’s survival. With that perspective, this paper updates the SBA situation report as of early 2001. We’ll attempt to answer, for the newcomer, journeyman, or acquisition professional: What success have we had? What evidence is there that we have made a difference? In this paper, we stand back from the individual efforts, and examine the issue from an enterprise perspective. When we do so, a reassuring pattern emerges. We attempt, as best one can in the midst of an event, to report on the transformation that is underway.  We present the evidence that exists to support the thesis that fundamental changes are occurring in the way the Defense Department acquires its new weapon systems. In part, this change is due to an increasing reliance on, and exploitation of, advanced technologies, including simulation, to improve both the development process as well as the products being developed.Figure 1.What is remarkable about the transformation we are witnessing is the manner in which it is occurring. Rather than the traditional top-down approach, the evidence indicates that the grass roots and lower-to-middle management levels drive much of the progress. The system developers are engaged in the process of natural selection, utilizing those techniques and technologies that make sense from a fiscal, cultural, and effectiveness basis.This paper provides a background on the SBA Concept and the current SBA Initiative. It presents an overarching view of current events; reviews and comments on the evidence; and assesses the progress being made by government and industry towards the vision.  Background3.1	Context: Current Revolution in Business AffairsThere are several revolutions underway today within the Department of Defense (DoD). The Revolution in Military Affairs challenges us to be prepared to engage in new and different types of conflicts that will be fought with new strategies, tactics, and weapon systems. Our warfighters now must address such things as information dominance, rapid force projection, and smart self-contained weapons.  As we modernize our armed forces, this revolution is defining what we must buy. Likewise, the Revolution in Business Affairs directs that we place management emphasis on core competencies. There is an emphasis to reduce overhead, leverage computer technology and ensure interoperability among warfighting systems. This revolution is impacting how we buy [Ref 1].3.2	 SBA ConceptThe SBA concept encourages the employment of a number of new technologies, including the robust use of simulation, to address what we buy, and how we buy it. In particular, some of the most promising technologies are those related to advanced modeling and simulation (M&S). SBA proponents believe that these technological advances will usher in an era characterized by the pervasive use of M&S tools in acquisition, not only across the disciplines and phases of a given program, but they will also be interoperable and employable across programs within a System of Systems (SoS) context. It is envisioned that many if not most of the key acquisition processes will be done in the virtual environment. This will permit, for example, many more alternatives to be examined than would be possible under the traditional acquisition process. This process will enable the design, refinement, manufacture, and delivery of both the product and its associated model and simulation representations. These representations will support the sustainment, modification, and ultimate disposal of the product over its total life-cycle. SBA entails deliberate and coordinated use of M&S across the many acquisition domains, and over all phases of a program’s life cycle. It further promotes the reuse of M&S between programs.3.3	The GenesisThe genesis of the SBA movement occurred at the grassroots level within government, in recognition of a need to change the existing DoD acquisition process. That need has been described in papers given at earlier Simulation Interoperability Workshops [Refs 2 and 3]. Faced with the task of more rapidly acquiring increasingly complex systems, with relatively fewer resources than in the past, individual acquisition programs have been forced to explore new ways to accomplish their mission. The advances in computer, visualization, communication, and other technologies have permitted these programs to use M&S to support the designing, building, testing and fielding of very sophisticated products.  The evidence from these experiences suggests that substantial economies can be realized if we can integrate the use of M&S across the various functional areas within a program; across the different phases of a program; and across programs themselves.  Today’s programs recognize that models and simulations will become core resources for the future of acquisition within DoD.  For all those involved in the acquisition of new systems (whether they determine requirements or address how the new weapons will contribute in a system of systems environment), the early and sustained use of M&S throughout the acquisition process will become essential. 3.4	Confirming EvidenceThe confidence the DoD leadership has placed in SBA is based on strong and compelling evidence found in recent acquisition programs.  In the Study on the Effectiveness of Modeling and Simulation in the Weapon System Acquisition Process, instances are cited that illustrate the potential benefits of SBA [Ref. 4]. Examples include how the Navy reduced the standard parts list from 95,000 for the Seawolf class submarine to about 16,000 for the NSSN through the use of M&S.  A team of 14 engineers at the Army Tank and Automotive Research Development and Engineering Center designed a new, low silhouette tank prototype in 16 months. A traditional approach would have required a team of 55 engineers work 36 months to achieve the same result. Computer Aided Design (CAD) models on the B-2 program permitted the Air Force to achieve first-time correct tube bending of expensive titanium electronic cable conduits.The evidence from programs such as these, combined with examples from the automotive and aircraft industries, and the research initiatives of DARPA and other agencies (e.g., Simulation Based Design) illustrates the potential contribution of a comprehensive, integrated simulation-based approach to defense acquisition. 3.5	SBA InitiativeThe initiative associated with SBA attempts to identify and implement the actions required to bring about the new approach to systems acquisition, and doing so in the most efficient, expeditious and least disruptive way possible. OSD is committed to making the benefits of SBA a reality, and recognizes the need for change in the acquisition process if we are to modernize the force. In 1998, a joint SBA task force made up of representatives from the Services and several DoD agencies was created to develop a conceptual Road Map of what needed to be done to realize an SBA environment in Defense acquisition.  It was recognized from the start that the acquisition community consists not only of the Defense acquisition workforce, but also includes industry. An SBA industry steering group worked with the Acquisition Functional Area Council to help identify the elements and principles associated with SBA and exemplified a tenet of SBA – a partnership between government and industry.  The current approach has been to encourage individual efforts to advance the knowledge about M&S in Defense acquisition, while taking those steps that, from an enterprise perspective, expedite and facilitate the dissemination and use of these best practices. The need for some foundational material has grown stronger with the formalization of the SBA initiative as a recommended strategy within the latest DoD 5000 series documents. The Acquisition Council of the Executive Council for Modeling and Simulation is currently sponsoring the work of Service and Agency M&S and acquisition specialists on the Acquisition Functional Working Group. Their task: develop a common understanding and descriptive framework for M&S in support of Advanced Acquisition Environments within which to describe and share their related activities.4.	Service ImplementationAll the military Services are initiating actions of their own in response to this initiative. And this trend is not limited to DoD alone. Other government agencies, such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), have similar initiatives. Meanwhile, the commercial sector has also made process changes that incorporate SBA-like ideas.4.1  ArmyThe Army’s initiative for capitalizing on M&S technology to address the issue of system development and life-cycle costs through the combined efforts of the requirements, training and acquisition communities is entitled: Simulation and Modeling for Acquisition, Requirements and Training (SMART).  This acronym was coined by LTG Kern (see the May/June 2000 issue of PM Magazine for additional thoughts by LTG Kern on simulation and acquisition reform).  For the Army SMART is about collaboration (see figure 2).  Figure 2The Army philosophy has been one of centralized planning and decentralized execution. To motivate their PMs to incorporate SMART into their programs, they have implemented a multi-pronged approach. First, the Army has designated several of their programs (i.e., Crusader, Apache, Future Scout Cavalry System and CCTT) as SBA flagship programs. Each of these programs, representing different domains, have placed a heavy reliance upon M&S, and share their implementation experiences with other Army programs. Second, the Army has looked for opportunities to leverage the work being done by others. They have entered into a formal agreement with NASA to participate in a number of M&S related initiatives (e.g. RDEC HLA Federation, an Army/NASA Virtual Integration Laboratory, and an ICT immersive training environment.) The Army is working in collaboration with DARPA on defining the Future Combat System: a multi-function, multi-mission re-configurable system of systems that maximizes joint inter-operability, strategic transportability, and commonality of mission roles. The first phase is a DARPA/Army collaboration that has been touted as the Army’s’ SMART “proof-of-concept” program. In the area of M&S-related standards, the Army is working with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Finally, the Army has promoted awareness of SMART within its acquisition and key stakeholder communities. This is accomplished by holding annual SMART conferences attended by those responsible for system requirements and system training, as well as from the program offices themselves. This year's conference, co-hosted with NASA, will be held this April in Florida. It will address the opportunities and technologies available to be shared as products of the Army SMART and NASA Intelligent Synthesis Environment (ICE) initiatives.          4.2	Air ForceOn 1 June 2000, the Air Force issued its new instruction AFI 16-1002 that provides a policy framework for the elements of SBA. The new instruction was the result of direction received at the 3-Star Air Force Acquisition Community Modeling and Simulation Summit in May 1998. Subsequently, an SBA Tiger Team was formed in December 1998 under the leadership of the Air Force Materiel Command. When the work was presented at a General Officers SBA Conference in January 2000, the need for an SBA Infrastructure Program was identified. The Air Force is now developing the plans to implement a funded infrastructure program, with the Electronic Systems Center at Hanscom AFB as the lead in SBA program development and management. Specifically, the new Instruction is intended (a) to guide the direction of M&S in Air Force acquisition; (b) implement DoD policy for using M&S in the acquisition process; (c) guide Air Force M&S investment strategy; (d) ensure M&S acquisition products are effective, suitable and reliable; and (e) link M&S use in acquisition to requirements generation, testing, logistics and education. 4.3	NavyThe Navy has begun work on a Campaign Plan to address the technical and cultural challenges that exist in implementing SBA.  They plan to review a plethora of related initiatives that exist within, or are sponsored by, the Defense Department that include: Integrated Digital Environment (IDE);Joint Computer-Aided Acquisition and Logistics Support (JCALS);Integrated Manufacturing Technology Initiative;University projects (e.g., MIT Center for Innovative Product Development); and Collaborative commercial e-commerce marketplace ventures.  They hope to identify a set of common enablers associated with all of these efforts, and then focus the Navy’s efforts on implementing these enablers. In building its business case for investment in SBA, the Navy is concentrating on return of investment at two levels: (1) within programs where faster and smarter decisions can be made, at less cost with a better product; and (2) more efficient Test and Evaluation; and at the Corporate level to foster a system of systems analysis for a wiser investment and ultimately yield more affordable programs. Currently, many Navy programs are implementing several aspects of SBA that will yield valuable lessons to the acquisition community.5.	DoD and Other InitiativesAt the Office of the Secretary of Defense level, there has been evidence of progress on several fronts.In the policy arena, the Defense Department has recently completed rewriting the series of directives that govern Defense acquisition.   The current coordination versions of these new directives formally incorporate Simulation Based Acquisition into DoD policy.The Defense Department Foundation Initiative 2010 project is developing and validating the set of core products for the Test and Evaluation Community. Its products will provide the interoperability needed to create synthetic battle-spaces that contain actual weapon systems at multiple ranges; system components in hardware-in-the-loop facilities; or simulations of weapon systems.  Furthermore, the establishment of a common architecture will further enhance the reuse and interoperability of range assets.  The Foundation Initiative is developing and validating a common architecture [referred to as the Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA)], a core set of tools, inter-range communications capabilities, interfaces to existing range assets, and a repository of reusable software, along with recommended procedures for conducting synthetic exercises. TENA will be compliant with the DoD HLA for simulations. It will address those areas of test not supported by HLA and drastically improve the ability of ranges to interact with simulations. In an effort to better understand the actual level of usage of M&S in DoD programs, the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation contracted Hicks and Associates to conduct a survey of what M&S is in use; how it is used; who maintains it; how is it certified; and the extent of program investment in M&S.  The survey found that:Current DoD M&S is not viewed by PM’s as cost or schedule effective;More work needed on M&S development and documentation to support acquisition;Guidance is needed on how to manage M&S efforts;Forward planning and an early investment for M&S needs to be accomplished by program offices where the focus is typically on the short term.As a follow-on to this study, Hicks and Associates has been asked to lead a more detailed data collection effort on programs nominated by the Services as pilot programs.Finally, the National Research Council has initiated a study through the Board of Manufacturing and Engineering Design at the request of the Director of the Defense Modeling and Simulation Office, to look at Modeling and Simulation Enhancements for the 21st Century Manufacturing and Acquisition. Their report should be completed in late 2001.6	SummaryWe have presented a brief summary of the motivation for the development of the SBA Concept, a brief description, and the background of events that have taken place over the past five years.  In addition, we have also reviewed a number of current actions that are underway across the Defense Acquisition Community.  This evidence, taken together, suggests that not only does SBA represent the future of systems acquisition within the Defense Department, but that that future is not as far away as was once thought. In addition, progress is being made at the OSD and Service corporate level through overarching policy that embraces the concept and technically it is occurring through the coordinated, but individual efforts of many. We continue to face challenges. However, building upon the work that has been done to date, and capitalizing on the opportunities and initiatives of others, we will continue progress towards making the move for SBA from Motivation to Implementation. An NDIA/DoD sponsored SBA conference is planned for the Washington DC area in May 2001. This venue will provide a forum within which to gain insight on the progress made by the community and the challenges that remain.
