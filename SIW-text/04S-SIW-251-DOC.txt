Disband RPR FOM and DIS and reform under new charter to support both. Disbanding is probably bad idea because each group does have individual requirements. Better idea is to coordinate efforts by having separate groups and just meeting together.How do derivatives from RPR FOM stay consistent with continued work on RPR FOM and DIS?  Would like systems that still have DIS requirements that are using both HLA and DIS to have a reference FOM to follow.  Some divergent RPR FOM derivatives have not followed exact standard. But the RPR FOM still provides a specific structure to follow.For next SIW, make sure that DIS and RPR FOM are scheduled at separate times.It would be good if we could acquire a freely available tool to convert between 1.3 and 1516 OMT.
