Extending a simulations Synthetic Natural Environment (SNE) beyond a sole terrain representation to include 4-D meteorological and oceanographic data is rapidly becoming a requisite.  Legacy applications are being retrofitted to incorporate key environmental influences while new systems are being developed to utilize a whole host of environmental services leading to a new family of “environmentally aware” applications.  Systems supporting computer generated forces and visualization have dominated this family of Modeling and Simulation (M&S) applications thus far.  However, the environment frameworks developed to date have appeal to a wide array of military functions, in both simulation and operational mode.The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Weather Impact Decision Aids (WIDA) program is developing a suite of tactical decision aids (TDAs) which model the impact of weather on a wide variety of functions in the mission planning lifecycle.  This lifecycle includes force level planning, mission and pre-mission planning, and mission execution.  Each of these phases offers significant opportunities to leverage the impact of weather.  By considering the impact of weather over a given mission cycle we increase the ultimate success of an operation. In a “train as you fight” military, evolving operational tools, such as those being developed under the WIDA program, should be quickly adopted by the training simulation community.  Likewise, the SNE infrastructures developed primarily for war gaming have equal utility in stimulating operational systems with historical and tailored weather scenarios for training effectiveness. Integrating the current family of M&S environmental services with systems such as WIDA illustrates the potential marriage between simulation assets and operational applications.  This paper provides a brief overview of mainstream environmental SNE frameworks, a discussion of the WIDA program and products, and a short synopsis on the convergence of these complimentary technologies.1.  Mainstream SNE InfrastructuresIn 1993, the Defense Modeling and Simulation Office (DMSO) made the first major DoD investment in environmental modeling and simulation through the funding of the U.S. Army Topographic Engineering Center’s (USATEC) “Dynamic Environment and Terrain in DIS” project.  The accomplishments of this project laid the foundation for the establishment of the Synthetic  Environments  (SE) program.  The SEprogram, under sponsorship from 1994-1997, was a tri-agency funded initiative sponsored by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), DMSO and USATEC.  The SE program focused on developing a suite of environmental simulation technologies for the Synthetic Theater of War (STOW 97) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) as well as the general M&S community.One major success of the SE program was the development of the Total Atmosphere-Ocean Server (TAOS).  Note: TAOS has recently been expanded to include support for the space regime and is now commonly referred to as Total Atmosphere, Ocean and Space (TAOS) environmental services.  The main components of TAOS include Integration, Visualization, and Distribution.The Integration Component includes a series of atmosphere, ocean, and space environment receivers which provide access to and retrieval of environmental data from a wide variety of authoritative sources including the prominent DMSO developed Master Environmental Library (MEL).  The Integrator is also a data fusion and transformation system populating a single 4-D representations of the natural environment from multiple environmental input sources and subsequent value-added transformations.The Visualization Component supports dynamic 2-D and 3-D visualization, animation, and a 2-D weather chart generator supporting the needs of operational METOC officers and exercise controllers.  The Distribution Component commonly supports efficient delivery of time-stamped 3-D gridded or observation point data to simulators or federates in a scalable DIS or HLA/RTI architecture.  Beyond the success of STOW, TAOS has supported a wide variety of simulation programs and continues to evolve in support of new regimes of environmental data and effects.Other evolving services which complement the current DoD M&S SNE framework include the DMSO sponsored Environmental Scenario Generator (ESG) program.  ESG is developing data mining tools for locating historical environmental events that meet specific training objectives.  TAOS, along with the continued expansion of MEL and ESG provide an end-to-end suite of environmental services for use in future simulation initiatives.Fig. 1: A common concept of operations for delivery of environmental data to simulation applications2.  Weather Impact Decision AidsThe Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is developing new products which translate conventional forecast weather data, similiar to that distributed by a system such as TAOS, into information which enables our military commanders to plan strategic missions that exploit the battlespace environment.  Knowledge of weapons and systems used by friendly and enemy forces coupled with a growing superiority in weather prediction technologies provide an unparalleled opportunity for decision makers to maximize their military advantage.  Consider the following example.  For a planned mission a commander is given high confidence concerning the predicted weather during the mission execution window. He then can proceed by (1) assessing the impact of the weather on all weapon system/target combinations; (2) selecting the optimum weapon systems for each mission; and (3) selecting the optimum mission execution time and tactics to best optimize all parameters involved.Sensor Sensitivities to WeatherWIDAs forecast the performance of electro-optical (EO) weapon systems and devices based on weather forecasts, sensor characteristics, and other scenario parameters. The systems include laser-guided, television (TV), low-light-level TV (LLLTV), image intensifiers (e.g., Night Vision Goggles [NVGs]), and 3-5 and 8-12 m infrared (IR).  The weather impact varies among these systems, mainly because the sensors they employ operate over different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.LaserLaser guided systems require that both designator-to-target and weapon-to-target paths have low attenuation, mainly from aerosols, and a cloud-free line-of-sight.  A threshold range is required for successful weapon lock-on.  Also, the deployed aircraft must maintain a minimum standoff range during target designation.  If either lock-on range or standoff range is too small the mission is jeopardized.TV, LLLTV, and NVGsSystems operating at visible and near-IR wavelengths require a cloud-free line-of-sight, and low attenuation, mainly due to haze, fog, and precipitation, in order to maintain high apparent contrast between target and background.  Again, maximizing weapon lock-on ranges and pilot standoff range are critical.  InfraredFinally, systems employing infrared sensors in the 3-5 and 8-12 m region are impacted by clouds, high absolute humidity, and aerosols.  In addition, sufficient thermal contrast between target and background, largely driven by weather factors, must be present in order to successfully employ IR systems.  In each, the sensor performance in identifying optimal target/background contrast can be seriously degraded by weather factors.Mission Planning LifecycleWeather impacts the mission planning lifecycle in each of its phases: force-level planning, mission planning, pre-mission planning, and mission execution. Force-Level Planning Phase Timeframe: –72 to -48 hrs prior to mission.  This phase focuses first of all on the positioning of forces.  Secondly, given knowledge of the forecasted weather throughout the mission window a commander can stockpile weapons complementing the mission execution phase.Mission Planning Phase Timeframe: –48 to -24 hrs prior to mission.  This phase, from an Air Force perspective, issues Air Tasking Orders (ATOs) containing several mission essential elements including: (1) a suite of candidate targets within the mission; (2) a suite of optimum weapons to be deployed against the mission; and (3) the optimum mission execution times.  Understanding the impacts of weather on each mission strengthens our confidence regarding a successful military campaign.Pre-Mission Planning PhaseTimeframe: –24 to 0 hrs prior to mission.  This phase addresses more specific predictions of weapons performance in response to the ATO.  Here the mission planners analyze the available weapons vs. time against specific targets to identify those target/weapon combinations which show a low probability of successful lock-on.  The planner also computes kill probability predictions as a function of weather, enemy defenses, and countermeasures.Mission Execution PhaseThis phase provides target and weapon lock-on forecasts over the mission timeframe.  Typically, three-to-six hour forecasts are made available by the METOC officers allowing the pilot to assess the probable detection/lock-on ranges for each designated target.  If the weapon guidance system operates in the visible or near-infrared, the approach azimuth should be assessed in order to factor in the position of the sun while approaching the target.  Similarly, if the weapon system operates in the IR, azimuthal variations in detection or lock-on range due to location of internal heat sources or solar heating should be examined.  The METOC officer also provides input as a function of confidence over time.Fig. 2: Weather Impacts on the Mission Planning Lifecycle   2.3  The Weather Impacts Decision Aids (WIDA) ProgramThe current AFRL WIDA program is a collection of four projects:(1) Infrared Target-scene Simulation Software (IRTSS).  IRTSS is developing new and improved air-to-ground IR targeting and navigation models which incorporate the impacts of weather.(2) Night Vision Goggles (NVG) Operations Weather Software (NOWS).  NOWS is developing and integrating new models which determine the influence of weather and illumination on the performance of NVGs.(3) Target Acquisition Weather Software (TAWS).  TAWS leverages the models developed under IRTSS, NOWS, and other research programs to model weather impacts on detection and lock-on ranges for IR, TV, LLTV, NVG, and Laser weapons.(4) Weather Automated Mission Planning Software (WAMPS).  WAMPS will demonstrate how the WIDA products could be used to support automated mission planning.  At this point, a demonstrator system is in the early stages of development.2.3.1  Sample WIDA ProductsThe following section provides a brief look at several types of evolving WIDA products.2.3.1.1  Detection or Lock-on Range vs. TimeMaximum detection range is the maximum range at which a human observer can detect a target using the weapon system’s cockpit display or detection device.  Maximum lock-on range is the maximum range at which apparent target contrast and size are sufficient to lock-on to a target.  This product illustrates the optimum time during a mission execution window when the range to detect or lock-on to a target is maximized.  Figure 3 depicts a three hour mission window for NVG operation.  During this time period the detection range varies as a function of weather and illumination.  In this example, the optimum mission execution time period is 90 to 120 minutes prior to the current planned mission execution time.Fig. 3:  Detection Range vs. Time2.3.1.2  Detection or Lock-on Range vs Approach Azimuth AngleWithin a given mission the detection or lock-on range is directly related to the azimuthal approach direction.  Flight altitude, time of day, time of year, target orientation, illuminaton, and predicted weather provide a means to calculate the optimal approach azimuth to maximize a sensor’s target maximum lock-on  or detection range.  Figure 4 provides an example illustrating an optimal approach azimuth.  An aircraft approaching from due east or due west at flight altitudes of 2000, 3000, or 4000 feet provide the greatest lock-on range in comparison to all other approach azimuths.   Fig. 4: Detection Range vs Approach AzimuthProbability of Horizon DetectionHorizon detection is a critical element for pilot orientation, particularly for nighttime operations relying on NVGs. Pilots flying without horizon detection must rely heavily on cockpit instrumentation.  Atmospheric conditions, illumination, flight direction, time of day, and time of year all contribute to the degradation of horizon detection.  Figure 5 illustrates a simple example where horizon detection is reached.  Decision makers may wish to modify a given mission’s flight direction, flight altitude, or mission time in order to optimize this factor.Fig. 5: En Route Analysis – Horizon DetectionTarget-Oriented AnalysisAltitude of flight can be used to determine the optimal level where a sensor’s detection range is maximized.  Figure 6 depicts three flight altitude scenarios where an air to air refueling exercise is analyzed against probable detection ranges of the second aircraft.  In this example a flight altitude of 2500 feet provides the longest range to lock-on.Fig. 6: Target-Oriented AnalysisAutomated Mission PlanningIn order for the WIDA TDA applications to effectively support large-scale exercises throughout the mission planning lifecycle, potentially involving thousands of missions, the TDAs must be integrated into current and future automated mission planning systems. Their performance predictions would then be included among the other factors that ultimately lead to a successful battle plan.  The goal of the WAMPS demonstration system is to illustrate how weather and WIDAs can help in generating ATOs, monitoring missions, and dynamically re-planning missions that are in the mission execution phase.  Figure 7 shows a concept for displaying performance predictions for multiple sensors against a high-value target, 72-hours in advance of the mission.Fig. 7: Weapon System Performance Prediction WIDA SummaryKnowledge of the weather can be exploited by knowing the limitations and advantages of each military system and its relationship to weather.  Integrating weather into the mission planning lifecycle is an essential requirement to improving efficiency and accuracy in today’s military campaigns.Increasing automation in the mission planning, execution, and replanning process is directly correlated to the effectiveness of a given mission.  Improving the mission planning process to exploit the impact of weather is paramount.WIDA, when properly integrated with current SNE technologies, provides a framework to address time critical mission planning activities within the simulation domain.  The staff-level training community can leverage rapidly growing M&S technology to support more advanced and stream-lined mission planning functions during simulation exercises. 3. ConvergenceCurrent acquisition processes for military systems in the command and control domain are beginning to prescribe switch-based control for selecting between live and simulated operation.  These architectures afford an opportunity for applications once developed specifically for simulation purposes to be adapted to support dual-use (live and simulated) operations.   The Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) community’s Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN), planned for development over the next few years, is a strong case in point.  The JWARN system will collect, analyze, identify, locate, report and disseminate NBC threats in command and control operations.  At the same time, the system will support a training mode comprised of simulated NBC threats in a wide variety of historical weather scenarios allowing “what if” analyses and training opportunities.  From the weather modeling perspective JWARN provides an excellent opportunity to leverage evolving SNE assets such as MEL, ESG, and TAOS, thus demonstrating substantial convergence of environmental modeling and simulation technologies with emerging operational systems.The WIDA family of mission planning tactical decision aids, targeted for insertion into future command and control systems, is yet another domain which can leverage M&S SNE infrastructures.  These systems, designed to leverage operational weather sources, can be easily modified to accept historical weather feeds from M&S resources having access to vast weather scenario archives identified and tailored to specific training objectives. For example, as the WAMPS demonstrator evolves, the simulation environment would be an excellent way to evaluate, improve and show the added value of  weather support to automated mission planning.Conversely, the war game community is in need of the technology offered by programs such as WIDA.  We are beginning to introduce the presence and effect of the environment in major simulation programs.  Complimenting these simulations with equally powerful tactical decision aids that educate commanders on the impact of weather is necessary if we are to realize a “train as you fight” military.  The Air Force EOTDA, soon to be replaced by TAWS, is currently executed by METOC officers during mission planning for EO weapon systems. The results are briefed to commanders and aircrews as part of their “weather briefing”.  In a train as you fight military, the WIDA products should also be available to METOC officers participating in simulations.Another use of the WIDAs in war gaming would be to factor weather impacts on mission success.  The WIDA products could be used (in a simulation) to evaluate the probable success of an attempted mission based on weather.   This would directly factor weather into mission success rates.  When used to evaluate mission success, the “actual” weather and scenario parameters would be applied, and the probability of success objectively determined by the WIDAs, thereby providing a more realistic assessment of the set of future targets in the simulation.4.
