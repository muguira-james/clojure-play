This was sufficient to accomplish our objectives.  Graham Shanks volunteered to be the vice-chair and Grayden Figart offered to be the secretary.The State of DIS was reviewed and the reason given for forming a DIS Study Group. Five years of the absence of a DIS forum has led to individual services, organizations and companies interpreting the IEEE 1278.1a to meet their needs which have led to interoperability issues.  New distributed simulation requirements have also emerged which need to be addressed.  DIS and DIS/HLA gateways are still prevalent in the worldwide distributed simulation environment and will be for the foreseeable future.All proposed clarifications to the DIS Standards and new DIS capabilities will be reviewed to ensure that they are compatible with the HLA RPR FOM and the HLA Standards.A draft process for submitting DIS problems and change requests was discussed. A draft Problem/Change Request (PCR) Form was reviewed and updated based on the discussions.An initial list of 45 DIS PCR’s was reviewed.The group’s work will proceed in phases as follows:Outreach to gather DIS issues and non-standard DIS implementations.Process PCRs and perform initial analysis.Draft a PDG Nomination for an IEEE 1278.1 PDG for changes needed to the DIS Standards. By the Spring 2004 SIW.Draft a PDG Nomination for a RPR-FOM PDG for changes needed to RPR and GRIM documentation based on DIS changes by the Fall 2004 SIWInterim Report at Spring 2004 SIW.Final Report at Fall 2004 SIW.To expedite the work of the group, whenever possible and feasible, draft documentation will be generated as part of the analysis of a PCR that can be provided as an input to the PDG.The group agreed that we need to advertise the work of the DIS Study Group to DoD agencies, companies and other organizations.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)9Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)22Peak attendance (including joint sessions)NATotal papers presented0“No-show” presentations0Other presentations and panel discussions0Recommended Reading List nominations (including previous nominations):None___________________________________________Submitted by Frank HillSDS International23 September 2003PAGE  PAGE  1
