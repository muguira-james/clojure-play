U.S. military personnel have been deployed throughout the world and are operating at a very high tempo that impacts the ability of the military services to effectively educate and train them.  ADL is being developed as a standard to guide the development of World Wide Web based learning technologies.  The two major components specified for ADL are the Sharable Courseware Object Reference Model (SCORM), an extensible Markup Language (XML) based model, and the Learning Management System (LMS).  The SCORM is an application independent specification that will provide the basis for describing the structure and content of both training courses and embedded lessons. LMS’s will manage SCORM compliant training courses in a client/server relationship, and be capable of providing a variety of services for the training service provider as well as the requestor.  The Defense Modeling and Simulation Office (DMSO) has recognized the value of ADL, and is pursuing its use in its High Level Architecture (HLA) training program.  DMSO has funded a nine-month project to review and transform the current HLA training materials to SCORM-compliant modules..  The early focus of the HLA ADL project is on identifying HLA Training course material appropriate for the transition to ADL, and selecting an LMS with suitable functionality.  A training assessment has been performed to identify existing course content suitable for transformation into SCORM compliance.  The selected content was collected into an information model as a precursor to conversion to SCORM objects with the intent of maintaining flexibility; the flexibility of the information model is a risk mitigation strategy for addressing the changing nature of the SCORM standard.  The LMS selection process is managed via an LMS evaluation matrix that captures the functionality requirements and the degree to which available LMS’s meet the requirements.  This paper provides the results of the project’s hands-on experience gained working on these activities.Background  Since April 1997, the Defense Modeling and Simulation Office (DMSO) has sponsored free seminar training on the High Level Architecture (HLA) for DoD models and simulation.  The training has been made available to modeling and simulation management and technical professionals as a means of facilitating the usage of the HLA.  The seminar-training program consists of two types of training events.  The first type of event is the “regional” event, which draws its name from the circumstance that these events are scheduled on a geographically regional basis throughout the United States.  The second type of event is the “special” event, which is scheduled where, and when a host can promise that a minimum number will attend the training.  Each event is scheduled for two consecutive days.  A series of one or two hour presentations are given by DMSO approved instructors during each day of an event.  Over time, a library of DMSO approved presentations has been established to cover a multitude of HLA related topics from basic HLA specifications to advance tutorials on time or data distribution management within an HLA federation.  The selection of presentations for each event is established through preparatory coordination between the HLA training event coordinator and the event host.  The HLA training program also supports “focused tutorials”.  A focused tutorial occurs when one or more of the current HLA presentations is given during the tutorials session of a conference such as the Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization Spring or Fall Simulation Interoperability Workshops. Overall, the HLA Outreach program has been quite successful.  Each year numerous requests for training events are received and if possible, accommodated.  For example, in calendar year 2000, 12 regional events, 9 special events, and 10 focused tutorials were delivered throughout the world.Today, since the HLA has matured from an embryonic to a mature technology, DMSO has shifted its resources to address new challenges in DoD modeling and simulation.  Consequently, the funding currently budgeted to support HLA training will be gradually reduced to a level more commensurate with sustainment of a stable technology.  However, as need for training on the HLA has not decreased, a more cost-effective method for the delivery of instruction is required.  The instructional delivery method that holds the promise of providing meaningful cost-benefits to DMSO is the Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) initiative sponsored by the Under Secretary of Defense for Readiness and Training.  DMSO intends to supplant or augment portions of the existing HLA training program by means of ADL web-based technology to provide HLA instruction to whoever requires the training, wherever, and whenever they need it.Several significant challenges have presented themselves as DMSO has moved to accomplish this objective.  The most noteworthy challenge is that ADL has been an evolving technology, which has drawn upon the legacy work of several other organizations.  The ADL program began in November, 1997, and is about to release version 1.1 of their Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) specification.  As a newly developed technology, the best practices of employing ADL remain to be discovered.  The lack of readily accessible experience in successfully deploying an ADL-conformant training system is an obstacle confronting organizations attempting to convert existing training programs.  This obstacle was recognized early on in the development effort and the risk has been mitigated by the resolution to define a systematic development approach to guide this conversion effort.  As it happens, there was a systems development approach already quite well known within the HLA community.  It is the Federation Development and Execution Process (FEDEP).  The FEDEP has been developed based upon the best practices of the modeling and simulation professionals building HLA federations.  While it is unique to the HLA but it embodies the application of sound system engineering practices within an HLA context.  The development of an ADL web-based training program had many similarities to the development of an HLA federation distributed over the web.  Consequently, the macro steps of the FEDEP were adapted to apply to an ADL context.  This paper will present the results of the adaptation of the first three FEDEP steps to constructing an operative ADL system. Application of a Systematic ApproachThis project began with the general goal of the employment of a web-based distributed training system in mind and an approximate appreciation of the pathway to success.  The next step was the creation of a practical management process and a structure to guide the project.  For a management structure, a two-tiered hierarchy was selected.  This structure was selected because it had been successfully employed with previous DMSO HLA development efforts and was well understood by the participants.  The lowest tier is that of the development team.  AEgis Technologies Group was chosen as the development team because they were currently under contract to DMSO to operate the HLA training program undergoing conversion, and AEgis had successfully completed other products for DMSO.  The second management tier consists of two integrated product teams (IPT).  The first IPT was the HLA ADL Conversion Overview IPT.  It is being led by Dr. Katherine Morse of Epsilon Systems Solutions, Inc.  Dr. Morse’s IPT is charged to independently review development team progress and products for DMSO.  The second IPT is the HLA Training Program Content Review IPT, and is being led by Mr. Reed Little, of the Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute.  Mr. Little’s IPT was responsible for reviewing the content of the existing training program and making recommendations for change.  The DMSO project leader, Mr. Vic DiRienzo of the IITRI AB Tech Group, links together the two tiers of the structure.  Mr. DiRienzo is responsible overall project coordination and communication between the two project tiers, and the DMSO leadership.  In this manner, the development team is kept on track with DMSO’s needs and goals.  The core development team consists of four individuals, each with a set of unique skills required by this project.  Two of the developers are long-term HLA training program instructors who possess a thorough knowledge of the training material.  In addition, these instructors have an appreciation for HLA training audience characteristics (e.g. the typical concerns and questions).  The third member of the core development team has a background in Instructional System Design (ISD), and as such, offers a differing perspective on the HLA training program.  To date the majority of the HLA training program had been developed by simulation engineers and software developers with little ISD expertise.  The training program emphasis had been to disseminate information or to “get the word out” on the HLA.   During the training program conversion to a new presentation format, there is opportunity to address the educational impact of the training program and effect changes that will enhance its impact.  The fourth member of the core development team has a background in computer software, hardware and networking.  These are essential skills for undertaking the development of any web site.  A well designed content delivery system is critical for project success.  Other experts are called upon when needed to provide assistance in areas such as the review of prospective software tools, or the final polishing of content.As the management of this project was being addressed, research into the ADL technology was begun.  As was stated earlier, ADL has been a new and evolving technology.  A great deal of discovery has occurred within the program.  An overarching systems view of ADL technology and ongoing development was necessary.  There are two principal parts to an ADL-conformant training system.  One part is the content, which will be delivered to any student.  The second part is the web-based delivery system.  The investigation here focused upon documenting the interrelationships and dependencies between the training content and the web-based delivery system.  The former was addressed by the Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) specification.  The latter was addressed by the various implementations of a Learning Management System (LMSs), which were offered by several vendors.  The development team dissected each version of the SCORM specification and reviewed the available LMSs in order to understand the breadth of potential capabilities as well as the limitations inherent in this technology in its current state.  It was important to have a solid appreciation of both the capabilities and limitations of the technology so as to have an early assessment of what was possible and what was not.Definition of the System ObjectivesThe first macro step of the FEDEP is entitled “Define Federation Objectives”.  The goal of this step is to transform sponsor expectations into stated objectives for a federation to achieve.  Embedded within this step is the solicitation and documentation of the sponsor’s goals.  This is a very important activity for the successful development of a product.  The development team uses the sponsor’s expectations as a foundation for all subsequent work.  The development team must have a thorough understanding of the intent of the sponsor in order to research, design, and build the required product.  A firm foundation characterizing the existing HLA training program was necessary prior to any new development of an ADL-conformant HLA training program.  To accomplish this task an assessment of the existing HLA training was done.  This assessment documented the strengths and weaknesses of the existing program.  The training assessment provided recommendations that have been addressed in the HLA ADL conversion program.  In addition, the training assessment highlighted the need for an “information model” to describe the content of the existing training presentations.  The training assessment was also central to the establishment of project scope.  Given limited project resources, the breadth and depth of the HLA ADL conversion program needed to be appropriately scaled.  Concise project objectives were defined that were based upon goals that DMSO had for HLA training.  The primary objective was to convert, to ADL, the presentations normally given during the first half day of the HLA training program.  A second objective was to achieve a higher degree of interactivity in the converted material.  A third objective was to have a working prototype available for possible demonstration in the spring, with Initial Operational Capability by late summerDevelopment of a System Conceptual ModelThe second macro step of the FEDEP is named, “Develop Federation Conceptual Model”.  The goal of this step is to further transform the federation objectives into a set of highly specific federation requirements.  This is done by researching the real world actors, and activities, which need to be represented in simulation, then constructing a series of abstracted models that simplify the complexities of the real world.  One such model would establish the identity of the key actors and their relationships to each other.  Another model would capture the different activity states for systems of interest.  A third model would describe the sequence of important events as a developing story or scenario.  Altogether, these models provide the framework for the federation execution.  It is the operation of the federation that generates the data required to answer the sponsor’s analytical questions or training needs.  The HLA ADL conversion project adapted the FEDEP process of building a conceptual model so that this project could have a sound framework to guide future systems design and development.  The information model had its basis in the training assessment.  A method was needed to capture the training information of the existing HLA presentations.  In a two-day working group setting, the DMSO project lead and the core development team established the basic format for the information model.  A general-purpose spreadsheet software application was used as the tool to build the model.  A single workbook was selected to be the representation of the complete HLA seminar-training program.  This workbook became the repository for several spreadsheets, each of which represented a single presentation.  The overall concept was that each training presentation contained several individual yet related lessons. When assembled together, these lessons provided all the information contained within a training presentation.  For the purpose of this information model, each training presentation was referred to as a “course module”, and each lesson was designated as a “content module”.  A content module was meant to be the atomic level of training content.  Each content module was viewed as being complete and capable of being presented in and of itself.  The rows of the spreadsheet were used to describe data of a single content module.  The columns were used to describe data elements resident within every content module.  The information model was prototyped during the latter part of the working group session.  The overall workbook and spreadsheet structure for the model was judged to be sufficient.  The model was later refined with additional use into the following format.  The columns of the matrix were named, in order, “Content ID”, “Content Module”, “Desired Learning Objective (Rationale)”, “Teaching Points”, “Location”, “Level of Instruction”, and “Presentation Media”.  On each spreadsheet, data was recorded in a row and column matrix.  Figure 3.1 shows an excerpt from the spreadsheet for the Information Model.   The “Content ID” was a unique alphanumeric identifier assigned to each content module.  The “Content Module” was a unique name meant to identify each module, and, if possible, concisely describe its training content.  The “Desired Learning Objective” was the single training goal for each content module.  The “Teaching Points” describe the individual points of instruction that were made by the instructors during their presentations to achieve the content module training goal.  The “Location” referenced the place on a server where the content module resided.  The “Level of Instruction” indicated the relative complexity of the training material.  The HLA training presentations are of three differing levels: basic, intermediate, or advanced.  Finally, the “Presentation Media” described the media used to convey the training material.  The existing training program used Microsoft PowerPoint slides accompanied by instructor-spoken narrative.  The slides were composed of a mixture of text and graphics.  Therefore, the “Presentation Media” was described in terms of a combination of text, graphics, and narrative.  Figure 3.1 Information ModelA mapping was created between the version 1.0 SCORM specification and the information model once the information model’s format became set.  The idea was that the information model may contain information elements useful during the building of SCORM-conformant XML files for the HLA ADL conversion.  The Table 3-1 below contains the mapping.  Information ModelSCORM ElementsContent IDcourse.block.identficationContent Modulecourse.blockDesired Learning Objectivecourse.block.objectiveRefTeaching PointsNot applicable Level of InstructionNot applicableLocationcourse.block.locationTable 3-1 Information Model to SCORM MappingAfter the information model had been prototyped and the scope of the training material had been established, the information model was populated with the chosen training presentations.  During this work, the final definitions of the columns were set.  This work was time-consuming and required close collaboration between development team members so that the resultant work was harmonized in terminology and format.  The population of a course module spreadsheet began with the identification of the content modules of each presentation.  A content module could be either a single Microsoft PowerPoint ( slide or multiple slides.  Once the content module had been identified, the desired learning objective needed to be defined.  Next, the teaching points, the level of instruction, and the presentation media were recorded.  Finally, the location of the information was recorded.  The location evolved to become  the annotation describing a slide for configuration management purposes.  The full population of the information model built upon the information model prototype and thoroughly described the four HLA training presentations set as the primary objective.  These presentations consisted of 101 Microsoft PowerPoint( slides.  The resultant information model contained 57 content modules, which were captured in 40 man-hours of labor.                   Design of the System The third step of the FEDEP is entitled, “Design Federation”.  This involves identifying a set of participating federates, then ensuring the set of federates provides all the functionality required by the federation conceptual model, and writing a detailed development plan for the actual construction of the federation.  The analogous activity of this project centered around the identification, evaluation and selection of a LMS.  An early concept of the HLA ADL conversion was that the development team would not create a unique LMS but instead they would research the marketplace and recommend the use of a COTS LMS.  Thus, the research into LMSs marked the practical start of the system design phase.  This research was conducted in a two phases.  The first phase was to establish the range of the products available in the marketplace.  Once the capability range of the available products was known, an evaluation process was formulated.  The evaluation process was necessary so that the initially subjective LMS selection process could be made as objective as possible.  An evaluation matrix and an evaluation method were necessary to build an objective selection process.  An evaluation matrix was created that provided the development team the ability to annotate and remark upon salient features of all known LMSs.  The first opportunity the development team had to obtain LMS information was during a September ADL conference held in Orlando, FL.  Marketing literature was collected from the vendors who were in attendance.  This literature along with additional information generated through several web searches was used to identify a number of LMS characteristics, which could be used as evaluation criteria.  A preliminary LMS evaluation matrix was created that was evaluated for usefulness during ADL Plugfest #3 which occurred in November, in Orlando, FL.  At that time, the preliminary LMS matrix was found to contain too much detail.  Additional insights from formal vendor presentations and personal contact follow-ups led to a major revision of the categories of the evaluation matrix.  Once the structure of the evaluation matrix had been set, attention was shifted to completion of an evaluation process.  The intent is to have one evaluation matrix for every known LMS product.  The evaluation process is a scoring process in which an evaluator would initially indicate in one of the categories of the LMS evaluation matrix, the presence or absence of a particular feature.  Each category contains several features.  An evaluator also has the opportunity to record free text remarks within each category.  Based upon the information recorded in a category, the evaluator would assign a  raw score between 0 (not acceptable) and 5 (excellent) to each evaluation category.  A weighting factor between 1 (lowest) and 10 (highest) has been applied to every category.  The raw score will be multiplied by the weighting factor and will be the category score.  All the category scores will be totaled and a summary score will be assigned to the vendor’s product.  The product(s) with the highest summary scores will then be recommended to DMSO for use.  The evaluation matrix, shown in Figure 5-1, and the associated process were forwarded to the IPT for comment.  The LMS research led to an important discovery; the ADL software tool world was more complex than originally perceived.  The development team had held the naïve view that only two types of tools were necessary to perform the HLA ADL conversion.  One tool was quite naturally an LMS since LMSs were prominently featured in any ADL discussion.  The other required software tool was thought to be an XML editor because the content was going to be captured in XML files.  However, the team found that it was not a simple XML editor that was required but instead it was a more special-purpose content authoring tool that was needed.  One of the initial development concerns was the uncertainty over the difficulty of creating rich multi-media files from the existing PowerPoint slides and spoken instructor narrative.  A content authoring tool could be highly beneficial because it might greatly reduce the burden of creating the content XML files. A potential content production bottleneck could be avoided if a content authoring tool possessed a readily understandable graphic user’s interface that would make it easy to use, especially for subject matter experts, and if the tool possessed the capability to automatically produce SCORM conformant XML files.  These capabilities would reduce the need for the assistance of a XML knowledgeable computer specialist.           Also, the development team discovered the existence of a third type of tool.  The ADL world instead of being broken down into content authoring tools, and LMSs, was in fact divided into content authoring tools, content management tools, and LMSs.  A content management tool has functionality that is focused upon management of a body of learning content and the subsequent delivery of learning courses.  The content management tool facilitates the architecture of responsive training courses as opposed to a LMS which incorporates more business functionalities like learner identification, authentication, tracking, evaluating and billing. The content management tools have arisen in a middle area between the authoring tools and LMSs.  Figure 5-1 Evaluation MatrixFor some vendors, the content management was a natural extension of the authoring tool.  For others, content management was an embedded capability of the LMS.  The development team is researching whether a content management tool is required in this project.    Conclusion       The HLA ADL development team is pursuing an aggressive schedule to produce learning content modules and integrate them with a LMS, while mitigating the risks of working with an evolving technology.  Our experience has not been unlike that of the HLA protofederation developers, who faced some significant challenges that were due to the new, maturing nature of the technology.  The most practical solution is to move decisively to meet the challenges of an ADL implementation head-on, establishing and applying a solid systems engineering process to reduce the risk of ADL’s evolution.Author BiographiesJACK BORAH is a Senior Systems Engineer with AEgis Technologies Group.
