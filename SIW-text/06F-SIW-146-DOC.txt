Name of Forum or Group:  System Acquisition and Product DevelopmentChairJim CoolahanVice ChairTim JahrenSecretaryCrash KonwinObjectives for this Workshop:Sharing actual experiences from both industry and government regarding M&S standards, information sharing, reuse, collaboration, business cases, policy and process, as applied to system acquisition and product development (SAPD).Identifying approaches to key M&S issues in SAPD, and lessons learned in M&S application to SAPD.Comments and Recommendations:The two invited presentations (DDG-1000 and FCS) provided a good overview on M&S issues faced by major US DOD acquisition programs, and resulted in good attendance.  Attempting to have at least one invited presentation per workshop focused on a particular issue of SAPD interest appears to be a good long-term strategy.Several presentations highlighted the need for authoritative M&S data and appropriate metadata to ensure interoperability and validity.  This appears to be a growing need across a significant breadth of system/product acquisition/development programs/projects.Related to #2 above, more detailed attention needs to be paid to metadata issues across communities of interest.  As one paper pointed out, the current U.S. DoD Metadata Registry permits easy registration of metadata artifacts by users, but there is no process to ensure consistency of definitions across multiple registrations.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)37Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)52Peak attendance (including joint sessions)52Total papers presented9“No-show” presentations0Other presentations and panel discussions2Recommended Reading List nomination: 06F-SIW-049, Integrating Cost Estimating and Design Using SOA                 2006 FALL SIW OUTBRIEF FORM
