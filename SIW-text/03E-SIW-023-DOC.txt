DESERT PIVOT (DP) exercises focus on Command and Control (C2) mission operations training.  Specific exercise objectives include the development and execution of realistic tactical and operational-level C2ISR shooter-training activities, and the expansion of Distributed Mission Training (DMT) and Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) into real-world theater mission rehearsal capabilities.  These are Joint services exercises, including coalition forces that integrate live, virtual, and constructive systems.  DMOC was the recipient of the DoD’s Best Modeling and Simulation Training Program for 2001 in integrated Joint services exercises.The DP exercise network architecture is based upon the Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) and NATO-EX Data Standards with connectivity to external sites through point-to-point T-1 lines.  The simulation network is managed with two DMOC-developed utilities; namely, the DIS Filter- Analyzer™ (DFA) and the DMOC Software Router™ (TSRDSR).  The DFA provides a filtered connection between different LANs and WANs (Local and Wide Area Networks, respectively), and acts as a highly configurable gateway controlling dataflow between networks.  The TSRDSR is used to reduce bandwidth requirements by packaging broadcast data into multicast packets; and, performs the function as a carrier for any User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets, including DIS, NATO-EX, and video-conferencing packets that are broadcast to multiple LANs.  The DFA acts as a gateway between networks, whereas the TSRDSR acts as a transport utility.This paper presents research findings at DMOC in bandwidth reduction techniques that comply with DIS and NATO-EX based distributed exercise objectives, and describes in detail how the DFA and TSRDSR are used at DMOC to remain within the bandwidth limitations of the DESERT PIVOT simulation network architecture.IntroductionThe Theater Aerospace Command and Control Simulation Facility (TACCSF), Det-4, AFC2TIG located at Kirtland AFB, NM 87117, Det 4, AFC2TIG, is now also known as the Air Force Distributed Mission Operations Center of Excellence (DMOC)., located at Kirtland AFB, NM 87117 The DMOC , conducts at least four DESERT PIVOT Distributed Exercises each year.  The exercises focus on Command and Control (C2) Mission Operations Training.  To date, exercises have been run, focusing on conventional assets to fulfill training objectives.  They are to integrate C2ISR assets in synthetic battlespace environment; exploit and expand unique capabilities and expertise of DMOC; design, develop and execute realistic C2ISR/shooter training exercises; expand DMT/DMO to real world theater rehearsal training capability; and embrace leadership role in engineering, science, and training.The DESERT PIVOT Exercise network architecture is based on IEEE 1278.1a, the Distributed Interactive Simulation standard.  These distributed exercises have encountered bandwidth limits, because the external sites are connected by a T-1 link, which has a bandwidth of 1.5 Mbits/sec.  The link must send voice and data on the T-1, fulfill all exercise objectives, and conduct Video Teleconferences within the T-1 bandwidth limit.  This paper will discuss three bandwidth reduction techniques used for meeting exercise objectives while not exceeding the T-1 bandwidth limit.  They are the Bandwidth rules, the DIS filter, and the TSRDSR.DESERT PIVOT DescriptionThe DESERT PIVOT exercise is a C2 objective- oriented exercise that trains C2 warfighters in a simulated conflict.  DESERT PIVOT’s challenging scenarios facilitate strengthening individual, team, and inter-team skills through the use of increasingly difficult training blocks.  Crews are immersed in a robust and dynamic shared simulation environment.  To date, the Korean Peninsula, Southwest Asia (SWA), and Southwest United States (SWUSA) environments have been generated.  New scenarios designed to support emerging real-world areas of interest are being developed.  The SWA scenario includes 7 training blocks leading from peace to full hostilities, and includes stressor events such as targeting SCUD sites and rescues of downed airmen.  A dynamic air and ground war surrounds these events.The US Army fully participates with its Common Ground Station (CGS), a downlink receiver from the USAF JSTARS.  The CGS at Ft Huachuca, AZ, receives Moving Target Indicator data from JSTARS simulators and visual data from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) simulators, both located within DMOC’s virtual battlefield.  Real-world Army National Guard PATRIOT missile systems are co-located at the DMOC and “plug in” to the battle.  Army personnel also participate on-site at Nellis’ Combined Air Operations Center (CAOC) as a Battlefield Coordination Detachment.Participating units at DMOC also include crews from AWACS (Tinker AFB), JSTARS (Robins AFB), Ground Radar Modular Control Equipment (MCE)  (various active duty and Air National Guard units), UAVs, F-15Cs, PATRIOT Missile System (NM National Guard), and Cobra Ball surveillance aircraft.  Distributed participants across the country have included F-16s (Mesa AZ), Pave Low/Pave Hawk Helicopters (Kirtland AFB), Rivet Joint Mission Trainer (RJMT) (Offutt AFB), Space Warfare Center (Schriever AFB), high fidelity enemy Integrated Air Defense Systems (Information Warfare Center at Kelly AFB), and the Army Intelligence School (Ft Huachuca). To ensure high fidelity, operational-level play, DESERT PIVOT integrates elements of Hurlburt Field's Air Force C2 Training and Innovation Group (AFC2TIG) and Nellis AFB’s new CAOC.  In Fiscal Year (FY) 2001, three DESERT PIVOT exercises were executed, with a fourth planned, but canceled only 2 weeks before its execution due to real-world requirements in response to the terrorist attacks on 11 Sep 01, one exercise in FY 02, and 4 planned for FY 03.  During the last 24 months, more than 200 USAF and US Army personnel experienced exceptional training in DMOC’s DESERT PIVOT scenarios.  The inaugural exercise gained strong support from the Commander of the USAF’s Air Combat Command, and is quickly gaining the confidence and support of sister services.  Since its inception, US Army assets have been added, and US Navy assets were added in the spring of 2002.The DESERT PIVOT exercise series is clearly the most innovative training application of constructive and virtual simulation capacities created in DoD, and for the year 2001, and it received the DoD Award for Exercise Excellence in 2001.  Its visionary training approach, comprehensive training utility, and ever-increasing complexity mark it as a truly exceptional simulation innovation.The protocol used to exchange entity information is IEEE 1278.1a, or Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS).  Because the complexity and fidelity of the DESERT PIVOT exercises are increasing, the bandwidth usage on the local and distributed networks is also increasing.  The options dealing with the increased bandwidth are to increase the bandwidth of the distributed Wide Area Networks (WANs), use the available bandwidth more efficiently, or switch to a different protocol, such as High Level Architecture (HLA).  The former option is desirable because the architecture is in place and HLA has not been incorporated into each site that DMOC links are connected.  The other option is to use the available bandwidth available more efficiently, and this paper will first describe the DMOC WAN, then what bandwidth reduction techniques are used and how.DMOC LANs and WANsDMOC uses different Local Area Networks (LANs) in the DMOC Battlespace.  There are three common LANs, an Air LAN, a Ground LAN, and a UAV LAN.  Each exercise may require different local LANs, depending on the requirement.  The three common LANs are described in detail in the next section.DMOC common LANsThe DMOC battle space has three different local LANs that exchange DIS and other data.  The Air LAN has most of the DMOC virtual simulators connected to it, and has two constructive environment generators that send DIS data; Scenario Toolkit And Generator Environment (STAGE), and the Master Simulator (MSIM).  The Air LAN is also connected to other sites via T-1s.  The Air LANIt has a bandwidth capability of 100 Mbits/sec, but is limited by the T-1 bandwidth of 1.5 Mbits/sec.  The Ground LAN contains some of the Virtual simulators, and also an environment generator, Joint Conflict and Tactical Simulation (JCATS).  JCATS is capable of generating several thousand tracks.  The Ground LAN is isolated from the Air LAN, and has a 100 Mbits/sec bandwidth.  The DIS filter, as described later in this paper, connects these LANs, and can filter and monitor the data packets on each one.  The UAV LAN is a separate 100 Mbits/sec LAN that has the UAV constructive simulators on it; it, and is also connected via T-1 to Nellis AFB.  Another DIS filter is connected between the UAV and the Ground LAN.  Each LAN is monitored for bandwidth usage and data analysis.As stated before, the DMOC Air LAN is connected to other sites via T-1s.  The UAV LAN is connected to the Guardnet WAN, which has an allocated capacity of 768 Kbits/sec.  The TSRDSR is the method used to send data via the Guardnet to other Army sites, and is described in detail in a later section.DMOC external WANThe DMOC external WAN consists of several networks, the T-1s, and the Army Guardnet.  There are 12 different T-1s, which are connected to the AFC2TIG (2), 19th Special Operations Squadron (SOS), 58th Special Operations Wing (SOW), Air Force Research Laboratories (AFRL) Mesa, Luke AFB, Information Warfare Center (IWC), Joint National Integration Center (JNIC), Offutt AFB, Fallon Naval Air Station (NAS), and the Guardnet, which is connected to several Army bases.  Bandwidth Reduction TechniquesThis section will describe three bandwidth reduction techniques that are used in the DMOC run DESERT PIVOT exercises.Simple bandwidth rulesThe Bandwidth Rules are put in place to limit the amount of data on the DIS WAN, limit the users allowed on the DIS WAN, and limit the types of data on the DIS WAN.  They are:Network use for only exercise data (DIS/NATO-EX/etc.) during the exercise.No FTPs during exercise or integration testing.Maximize bandwidth by adjusting Protocol Data Unit (PDU) update rates.Remote terminal activity on other LAN if possible.Point-to-Point DIS PDUs transmitted on other LAN if possible.  Tactical data transmission on STU IIIs is preferable.The network rules allow control of what data is on each network, the update rates of specific PDUs, and the ability to control the flow of data on the WANs.  Continuous monitoring of the DIS WAN during the integration testing and exercise is required to determine if data packets are lost, unauthorized data is on the WAN, and to determine if the predicted bandwidth is accurate.  These measurements are recorded and analyzed to determine if the predicted bandwidth was accurately calculated.   The DIS Entity State PDU update rates commonly used are 55 seconds for ground stationary targets, 5 seconds for air objects, increased to 1 second when the distance threshold is exceeded.  Emission PDUs are sent once every 15 seconds, or when a change occurs.However, filtering of specific DIS PDUs is also required to limit what data is sent to which DIS LAN.  Filtering is accomplished by the DIS Filter, as described in the next section.The DIS Filter- AnalyzerThe DIS Filter- Analyzer (DFA) is a software application that can read DIS PDUs and determine if the PDU passes or fails the filter criteria set by the user.  Each PDU is read, and then tThe filter criteria are applied to each PDU’s as they are read on the network interfaces.  If the a PDU passes the filter criteria, the PDU it is immediately passed on to the outgoing LAN.  If the PDU fails any of the filter criteria, then PDU it is not passed on.The DFA receives DIS traffic on from two separate DIS LANs, which will be referred to by example as the Air DIS LAN and the Ground DIS LAN as shown in Figure 1.  													Figure 1.  DIS Filter- Analyzer LAN ConfigurationBased on operator-selected parameters, PDUs received on the Air DIS LAN are forwarded to the Ground DIS LAN, and PDUs received on the Ground DIS LAN are forwarded to the Air DIS LAN.  The primary functionality of the DIS Filter is to reduce the PDU traffic between two LANs.  Secondary functionalities are to separate voice and data PDUs received on one port onto two ports, and combine voice and data PDUs received on two ports onto one port.  The DFA software architecture is shown in Figure 2. EMBED Visio.Drawing.6  It is important to note that several filters could be applied at the same time.  For a PDU to be forwarded, it must pass all filters.  Also, a PDU and its interaction will be passed on.  For example, if an Entity turns on its radar and sends an Emission PDU, the Emission PDU is also forwarded.  If the Entity fires a weapon, the Fire and Detonate PDU is also forwarded.  The only exception is the range and DIS Enumeration filters.  These filters are relevant only for the Entity State PDUs.  An Entity State PDU must pass only one of these filters in addition to the other active filters to be forwarded. The sequence of filter checking is outlined below.Exercise Identification (ID).  The DFA can allow or deny any PDU by Exercise ID.PDU Type enabled filter.  The DFA can allow or deny any PDU by type, such as Entity State, Fire, Detonation, Start, Stop, etc.  Entity State PDUs and their interactions are allowed or denied, based on the filter criteria.Allow/Deny Site filter.  The DFA can allow or deny PDUs generated from a specific site/application/entity id. DIS Enumeration.  The DFA stores the allowed DIS entities based on their enumeration.  The DIS enumerations are marked such that the filter can deny certain types of Entity State PDUs based on DIS enumeration.  PDUs sent by the denied entities are also disallowed (e.g.: enumeration for a MiG29 is disallowed - Entity State PDUs from all MiG29's are filtered, as well as any fire/detonation/emission/etc. PDU's from those entities).Range filter.  The DFA has 400 spherical and cylindrical rRange filters available.  The Range filters are spherical or cylindrical, with the entity located at the center.  The filter allows Entity State PDUs within a range of a selected Site, Application, and Entity ID, or a specific latitude/longitude/altitude location.  This range filter can allow “bubbles of high fidelity” onto the LAN,.  limiting Controlling the amount of high fidelity data allowed onto the a LAN, thus reducesing the required bandwidth.  It is presented in detail in the following section.High fidelity regionsThe DFA Range filter has several different applications that are used for bandwidth reduction techniques.  One example, during the DMOC DESERT PIVOT exercises, is to send ground targets to an external site that has air to ground simulators.  As mentioned before, DMOC has an Air LAN and Ground LAN.  The ground LAN is a 100 Mbits/sec internal LAN, where all entities generated for the exercise reside.  The ground entities usually number around 7,000 – 11,000 tracks, which exceed the bandwidth of T-1's.  However, Air to Ground mission simulators at an external site need to see many of the ground tracks within their visual/radar range.  The Range filter is set such that it is within the radar range of the air to ground mission simulator, such as a F-15E, F-16, A-10, or other air to ground mission simulators participating in the exercise.   All other ground sites are filtered out, so only the entities of interest are sent via the T-1.  The ground sites could have an increased update rate, such that fidelity is increased, and the internal LAN can handle the increased bandwidth usage, but the bubble of high fidelity could be sent via a T-1 and not exceed the bandwidth.  The concept is shown in Figure 3, below.Another use of the range filter is to limit the amount of entity processing a simulator must do in an exercise of several thousand ground-entities, thus eliminating unneeded processing by the simulator’s network interface.   For instance, if a constructive environment generator generates tens of thousands of ground tracks, a JSTARS simulator can have a range filter applied that equals its radar range.  Therefore, the simulator does not have to process the tracks outside of its radar range.A third application that has been used in DESERT PIVOT exercises is for identifying bad data that crashes simulators during a distributed exercise.  One such example is when an incorrect PDU, sent by one simulator could potentially bring down several other participants in a distributed exercise.  The DFA would be installed between the distributed LAN, and another virtual LAN where the bad PDUs could be identified and filtered.  This application has proved invaluable in problem investigation and problem solving during DESERT PIVOT Exercises, as well as integration testing and unit testing.DMOC Software Router (TSRDSR)DMOC exercises support various data formats within its synthetic battlefield, commonly referred to as the battlespace.  As described before, the most prevalent is the Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) protocol as defined by the IEEE Std 1278.  Most of the battlespace simulations use this protocol to communicate between each other to present the warfighters with an underlying synthetic environment.  Many of the live-fielded systems, however, use the NATO-EX format for communication; this data also needs to be sent between the remote sites and DMOC.  One such particular instance is the connection of the remote Army National Guard Patriot, Joint Services Work Station (JSWS) and MCE systems through DMOC.  Partial T-1 links connect these live systems through a network known as the Guardnet, and the TDSR acts as a transport utility for this network and the data carried within it.  The TSR DSR additionally supports video teleconferencing for after action debriefs.ConstraintsWhen presented with the challenge of establishing the Guardnet connectivity to the DESERT PIVOT exercises, the DMOC team was also presented with two major constraints.  One of those constraints was seamless integration into the existing Guardnet network.  This meant modifying the remote sites' networks and system configurations as little as possible.  Great care was taken to ensure that no modifications were necessary to the existing Guardnet network of live systems and simulations.  This allows for a minimal impact of the DESERT PIVOT exercises on the existing infrastructure reducing the manpower required to support the exercises, and day-to-day training.  It also reduces the amount of system reconfiguration, thus reducing the dependency on outside contractors, and therefore, reducing the cost.  Another constraint is the bandwidth.  The Guardnet limits its participants to the bandwidth of 768 Kilobits per second (Kbps).  This bandwidth needs to support the DIS protocol simulation data, the NATO-EX live System formats (MPI), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image request and transmittal, the free text messages, and the exercise radio/voice communications.  Network architectureThe DMOC-Guardnet network architecture is shown in Figure 4, below.  The TSR DSR software was created to act as a single point of entry and exit for all of the exercise data, and it resides in the red routers in Figure 4.  It acts as a gateway and a transport utility while eliminating redundant broadcast data on a simulation network.  It also ensures that the T-1 bandwidth is not exceeded.  Figure 5 depicts TSR’s DSR’s role in typical exercise network architecture from the functionality point of view.  This figure omits the many physical devices in the network path; it only concentrates on the functional components of the architecture.Host platformThe TSR DSR software is hosted on a rack mounted Personal Computer (PC) platform running Linux operating system.  The current configuration includes a 1 GHz Intel Pentium III microprocessor, 1 GB of RAM, and 3 network cards.  It uses the Red Hat Linux distribution Version 7.3 with kernel Version 2.4.  The Host computer can be configured with as many network cards as are needed and practical to ensure the connectivity to all nodes.In the DMOC Battlespace the application is compiled using the latest GNU C compiler.  It is suspected, however, that any recent version and distribution of Linux and GNU compilers should be compatible with this application due to the nature of Linux.TSR DSR functionalityThe TSRDSR bandwidth requirement reduction is achieved by two means.  First and most importantly, TSRDSR utilizes a metering algorithm, which ensures the unreliable UDP messages are not lost.  This is accomplished by monitoring the amount of data being fed into the T-1 connection, and limiting that data on a per second basis.  User can specify the number of individual messages as well as the number of bytes allowed onto the T-1 link per second.  Any messages above that quantity are buffered and transmitted in the future when the network load is lessened.  This approach, of course, can add to the network latency, but it ensures that all of the data gets transmitted without the added overhead of reliable TCP connection.  TSRDSR can additionally assign priorities to messages based on their type and originator so as to minimize the latency impacts depending on system requirements.  It is important to note, however, that when the network load is below the critical threshold, there is no message buffering, and the latency is reduced to minimum.The second way the TSRDSR reduces the bandwidth is by using the multicast transport protocol where typically UDP broadcast is used.  In order to understand this process, one needs to understand how TSRDSR processes information.  Each instance of the TSRDSR running on the simulation network has dual functionality.  First, the application software simply listens to multiple ports and local networks for predetermined UDP broadcast data.  Once data arrives, it is packaged inside another data packet, and then it is multicast to all other potential TSRDSR hosts.  This functionality is referred to as a Local Interface, meaning it services the local LAN’s data.The other functionality of a TSRDSR node is to listen for multicast packets originating from other TSRDSR’s on the network.  When these multicast packets arrive, they are unpacked from their TSRDSR wrappers, and then they are sent to their original recipients, or broadcast on the local networks.  This functionality is referred to as a Remote Interface.  Every TSRDSR instance has only one Remote Interface, but it can have any number of Local Interfaces.  Typically for each network there are several Local Interfaces, which vary by the port numbers they are assigned to listen to.Application softwareThe TSRDSR application is written using the standard ANSI C programming language.  Currently it has a command-driven interface, although there are plans to incorporate a Graphical User Interface (GUI).  The program requires a configuration file, whose name is entered as a command line argument.  It also has a set of simple run-time commands, which alter the debug reporting and enable logging data to hard disk.The application also uses POSIX threads to manage the multiple Local and Remote Interfaces.  Each Interface is assigned its own POSIX thread to run in.  A POSIX Mutex is used when incrementing and resetting internal counters.  These counters are used for reporting the TSRDSR status and packet throughput.TSRDSR configuration fileAt startup the TSRDSR reads a configuration file, which defines the routing information for the current session.  A sample configuration file is shown in Figure 6.  The file serves three primary purposes.  It defines the Local Interfaces, the single Remote routing Interfacedata, and miscellaneous configuration data such as the buffering and threshold data, and the default debug level.The LOCAL keyword identifies the Local Interfaces TSRDSR listens to for data.  REMOTE keyword identifies how to route the remote messages, which arrive from other TSRDSR applications on the Guardnet.  FIFO_SIZE specifies how much data will be buffered in the event it exceeds the allowed bandwidth.  MAX_BYTE_RATE and MAX_MSG_RATE indicate the maximum number of bytes and individual messages that are allowed through the TSRDSR per second.  Once either of those parameters is exceeded, the messages are buffered.  The buffered messages in turn are sent as soon as the message flow falls below the threshold values.DEBUG_LEVEL indicates the default debug level at startup.TSRDSR runtime commandsAll route-related configuration data is loaded into the TSRDSR from the configuration file at startup.  The only runtime control relates to the engineering level reporting facilities.  Similarly to the DIS Filter, the application uses the concept of Debug Levels where each successive level includes the debug information from all of the previous levels. There is an exception to the cumulative nature of the debug levels, however.  Debug level –1 is a periodic reporting feature, which provides a statistical view of the system.  Typical output in this mode is shown in Figure 7.  The user can learn here how much data arrived on the local and remote interfaces, and how much data was sent out to the network.  This data is represented as an individual message count as well as a byte count.  This feature proves extremely useful when verifying the “health” of the simulation network.  The number of remote messages received at a given TSRDSR host should always equal to the sum of the messages sent from all Local Interfaces from the remaining hosts.The diagnostic messages can also be logged to a file for post-processing.  This is also accomplished by a runtime command.ConclusionIt is imperative to provide today's warfighters with a realistic training environment, which will stress them to the fullest.  It is also important to prepare them for coalition operations.  One way of accomplishing this is through distributed training and simulation such as the DMOC's DESERT PIVOT exercises.There are still many DIS-based distributed exercise infrastructures remaining in the simulation and training community. In many cases these infrastructures will remain in place for years to come, so it is imperative to use the available network bandwidth more efficiently.  As the role of distributed virtual, constructive and live simulation grows, tools such as the DIS Filter and the TSRDSR allow us to move forward, and to add to the training realism.There are other technologies, which provide similar functionality.  The tools described in this paper, however, offer maximum flexibility while maintaining minimal impact to the existing network and exercises infrastructures.5.
