of the efforts of the SISO Link 16 Product Development Group.  This group is the successor to the  SISO Tactical Data Link Study Group, which  began as a “grass roots” response to informal community inquiries by TACCSF.  The Study Group presented a DIS implementation of Tactical Data Link at the Fall 2003 SIW. This protocol would not have been possible without the contributions and hard work of each of its members. IntroductionJTIDS is a communications, navigation and identification system intended to exchange surveillance and command and control (C2) information among various C2 platforms and weapons platforms to enhance varied missions of each of the services. It provides multiple access, high capacity, jam resistant, digital data and secure voice communication, navigation and Identification (CNI) information to a variety of platforms.  JTIDS is the primary NATO standard for tactical datalink. NATO STANAG 5516/MIL STD 6016 describes the TADIL-J message formats and JTIDS network instructions. 	There are immediate operational requirements for existing military simulations to exchange TADIL-J/JTIDS data using a single interoperable standard. As military distributed simulation evolves further in mission scale and complexity, tactical datalink implementations need to interoperate.  The objective of this standard is to establish a single format to exchange TADIL-J messages, and to emulate a JTIDS radio frequency network.    In developing a protocol for simulating JTIDS in DIS and HLA, it is recognized that there are widely varying requirements for achieving fidelity amongst different users.  This protocol attempts to establish procedures that may be used by the vast majority of users, by establishing discrete, scalable, interoperable levels of fidelity for different users.  This in turn, allows for low cost initial implementation with a path toward upgrading to detailed JTIDS emulation as requirements evolve.The DIS simulation protocol for JTIDS is described in terms of the established DIS Transmitter and Signal PDUs.  There has been no change to the IEEE 1278.1a-1998 standard fields for the Transmitter or Signal PDUs.  JTIDS specific enumerations have been created to populate the standard fields. The implementation of JTIDS exploits the fact that both these PDUs are variable length.  In the case of the Transmitter PDUs, this protocol sets forth how the variable length “modulation parameter” fields must be populated.   In the case of the Signal PDU, JTIDS specific information is relegated to the variable length data fields. The HLA instructions are formatted in compliance with the IEEE 1516 standard for HLA.  The instructions are presented in the form of a Base Object Model (BOM) that may be incorporated into a system FOM. RPR-FOM based simulations should be able to easily integrate the Link 16 BOM into their FOMs.  Furthermore, there is a straightforward mapping between the DIS PDU implementations and the corresponding BOM components.ScopeIt is the objective of this protocol to establish a standard for TADIL-J message exchange and JTIDS network simulation in the DIS and HLA interoperability frameworks. The intent is to prescribe the content of the standard fields of the Transmitter and Signal PDUs and establish procedures for their use.  Compliance with these procedures will facilitate interoperability amongst JTIDS simulation systems.  ReferencesIEEE 1278.1a–1998 IEEE Standard for Distributed Interactive Simulation – Application ProtocolsIEEE 1516 –2001 IEEE Standard for Modeling and Simulation (M&S) High Level Architecture (HLA)MIL-STD-6016B, Tactical Digital Information Link (TADIL) J Message Standard (DRAFT) 15 March 2002NATO STANAG 5602, edition 1, Standard Interface for Multiple Platform Link Evaluation (SIMPLE) 20 Feb 2001System Segment Specification for Joint Tactical Information Distribution System Class 2 Terminal, 15 April 1999STANAG 5516, Edition 1, Tactical Data Exchange - LINK 16, Ratified 15 January 1997.LINK 16 Enhanced Throughput Standard, August 11, 1998 Doc # VSD-618255-97-339-02Joint Interoperability of Tactical Command and Control Systems Variable Message Format (VMF) Technical Interface Design Plan (Test Edition) Reissue 2, August 1996.Time Synchronization Server,  HYPERLINK "http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~ntp/" http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~ntp/Terms, Definitions and ConventionConventionsThe following terms and conventions are used for the purpose of this standard:SHALL indicates a procedure or capability is mandatory.SHOULD indicates a recommended procedure or capabilityMAY indicates a procedure or capability is optional.WILL/IS/ARE  are generally used descriptively for information purposes.Terms and DefinitionsAutomatic Acknowledgement:  A machine verification function whereby a terminal that receives a message addressed to it retransmits a copy of that message back to the source during a later time slot, verifying the receipt of the original message.Epoch: A 12.8-minute time interval consisting of 98,304 time slot intervals, each of 7.8125 milliseconds duration.

Each timeslot is 7.8125 milliseconds long with 128 time slots per second. Timeslots are organized into three interleaved sets (A, B, and C).  An epoch is 12.8 minutes long comprised of 32K timeslots.  There are 112.5 epochs in a 24-hour day.  Therefore, the current epoch, set and timeslot number can be calculated from the current time.  Operationally, groups of timeslots are assigned to a common function known as a network participation group (NPG).  Timeslot assignments are published in a Network Data Load (by a central net design agency), with participation groups identified by the timeslot set, the “offset” of the timeslot, and the timeslot repetition rate.  The repetition rate is expressed as n exponential power of 2, representing how often the timeslot assigned to the NPG occurs within the set.    TDMA architecture requires that each JTIDS participant, known as a JTIDS Unit (JU) know when its transmit timeslots occur. JUs must be synchronized with a common network time to receive and transmit on the network.  In JTIDS, one JU in a Network is designated as the Network Time Reference (NTR).   General RequirementsThis section describes general requirement for simulation of Link 16 independent of the simulation protocol used. The specific implementation under DIS is described in section 5.2.  The specific requirements for implementation under HLA are described in section 5.3.  The level of fidelity of simulation is indicated by the TSA mode.  Table 5.1.2 describes each of the TSA modes.Simulators in compliance with this standard shall at a minimum have the capability to identify the NPG and net number of transmitted data to allow them to operate at TSA mode level 0 and 1. All TADIL-J messages shall be bit encoded in accordance with the MIL STD 6016 TADIL-J specification. In the specification, each timeslot contains one 35-bit header, padded to 48 bits and a varying number of 75 bit messages unless the message type indicator specifies otherwise. Regardless of level of fidelity, all transmission modulation parameter fields shall be filled with meaningful data. When the header indicates Reed-Solomon encoding, the data area shall still comprised of non Reed-Solomon encoded TADIL-J messages.Any simulator that is not emulating JTIDS network data load throughput shall have the ability to configure the maximum number of JTIDS words transmitted per second, but shall not exceed the JTIDS maximum of 1536 words per second. (Packed 4 Single Pulse timeslot *128 timeslots per second). This upper limit shall not apply to JTIDS LET (Enhanced Throughput) packets. If the packing mode from the JTIDS header and the number of messages contained in the Signal message do not agree, (i.e. the header states that the packing mode is P2DP and there are 12 JTIDS words contained with the message) extra messages shall be dropped by the receiving simulator—as would happen in a live JTIDS datalink. Simulators should be able to determine if the number of messages in the header matches the actual number of TADIL-J messages. If there are fewer messages in the data area than prescribed by the packing mode, the receiver shall treat the missing messages as J31.7 “No statement” messages and parse the message stream accordinglySystems shall wait until the timeslot occurs to transmit data in order to receive the latest update to data (i.e. timeslots shall not be “pre-sent)”.  Receiving systems shall buffer messages after the timeslot has occurred to account for networkdelays. The amount of time to buffer messages for a timeslot shall be a runtime configuration item. The amount of time entered shall be the same for all participants in the same network and will cause the simulations to all “retire” a particular timeslot at the same time. This effect is not important for lower levels of fidelity (TSA modes 0,1) but is critical for all fidelity levels that tie a message to a particular timeslot along with an NDL. If the effects of messages arriving later than the timeslot are not important (multiple JUs transmitting in the same timeslot, contention access, data arriving while the receiving JU is transmitting), or the physical network infrastructure has low delays (less than 3 msec), the buffer time can be set to a low number or to zero.All systems set at fidelity level two or higher shall have their system times synchronized to a common time reference. Any error in the clock synchronization times (e.g. average NTP error) must be added to the network delays (the buffer time) before retiring a timeslot. NTP (or equivalent) or HLA time management is recommended.All systems should have some representation of a terminal clock time. If medium fidelity synchronization is to be accomplished, the system shall model a terminal clock (and its associated drift). At TSA level 2 or greater, if multiple messages are received with identical TSEC, Net Number and Time slot number, receivers shall discard all messages except from the closest transmitting entity (in the simulation space).There are three operator selectable communication modes for a real JTIDS/MIDS network, modes 1,2, and 4. The selected communication mode determines whether or not the network can operate on multiple nets (by employing frequency hopping) and the transmitted data are encrypted. All JUs in a JTIDS/MIDS network must operate in the same communication mode.The normal JTIDS communication mode is mode 1.  Frequency hopping and MSEC/TSEC is simulated appropriate to the specified level of fidelity.When operating with JTIDS communication mode 2, there will be no frequency hopping, but MSEC/TSEC shall still be used, depending on the level of fidelity. The explicit frequency of 969 MHZ shall be set in the transmission message frequency field and the bandwidth will be 3MHZ. The net number in the signal message shall be zero for all transmissions (no multi-netting).  Mode 4 eliminates communications security in addition to the features of communications mode.  The MSEC and TSEC fields shall be set to 0 when in communications mode 4 in addition to specifying the explicit transmit frequency as in communications mode 2.Table 5.1.1: JTIDS Communication Modes 	Timeslots shall be numbered sequentially, such that timeslot 0 represents timeslot A-1, timeslot 98303 represents C-32767. When the epoch is 112, the last valid timeslot is 45151 (end of the day).Generated machine receipts shall use timeslots as assigned in the network description. There is no special consideration given to machine receipts, they are treated as any other TADIL-J fixed format message.Relay is accomplished by transmitting relay information in assigned timeslots. There is no special mechanism necessary to simulate relay transmissions.Levels of FidelityThis protocol allows simulations to achieve different levels of fidelity by assigning one of five Timeslot Allocation (TSA) levels. If the simulator allows for a settable level of fidelity, the level of fidelity shall be set at runtime.  The TSA level shall be set in Modulation Parameter #1 of the transmission packet with an enumeration of 0-4 as described below.  Table 5.1.2: JTIDS Levels of Fidelity TSA LevelFidelitySynchronization FidelityIssuesRecommended Usage0LowLowDoes not emulate JTIDS network characteristics. Data rates are not constrained. Intended for legacy use.Experiments and/or training concerned with message format and/or message content only.1LowLowDoes not emulate JTIDS network characteristics. Allows for bandwidth throttling to emulate JTIDS network throughputs without assigning messages to specific timeslots. Net Data Loads can be loaded into terminal simulation equipment to simulate data rates in NPGs on the Link 16 network.2MediumLowNetwork delay must be sufficiently small if time slot sensitive conversations are required to duplicate live Link 16 networks (e.g. relay emulation, RELNAV, messages requiring responses). Experiments and /or training concerned with throughput limits of the Link 16 network.

The NPG and net fields are filled in the signal message, but all other data in the JTIDS transmission header is set to the default value. Multiple messages are permitted in a single signal message.  All messages within the signal message are assumed to be for the same NPG & Net with the same assumed packing.  There is no TSA or metering with up to the maximum number of messages (as specified in the DIS standard) packed into data area of a single signal message. Low fidelity synchronization is achieved in accordance with paragraph 5.1.4.1 of this protocol.  TSA Level 1, Low FidelityTSA Level 1 is similar to TSA Level 0 except that there is minimal metered data. When  theTSA level is set to one, one timeslot worth of information shall be in one signal message. As in TSA level 0, the NPG and Net fields are filled in, and the rest of the transmission information is set to default.  Low fidelity synchronization is achieved in accordance with paragraph 5.1.4.1.TSA Level 2, Medium FidelityTSA Level 2 allows for metered data with no encryption.  When the TSA level is set to 2, messages shall be assigned to individual timeslots.   The NPG, Net, and Timeslot identification fields are filled in. The TSEC and MSEC are set to default.  Low fidelity synchronization is achieved in accordance with paragraph 5.1.4.1.TSA Level 3, Medium FidelityThis level enables full TSA to include Encryption.  When TSA mode is set to 3 ,stacked nets, multinets, and crypto nets can be emulated.  All transmission information fields are filled in.  Low fidelity synchronization is achieved in accordance with paragraph 5.1.4.1.TSA Level 4, High FidelityIf the TSA mode is set to 4, everything from TSA 3 is emulated, with the addition of the medium fidelity synchronization procedures in paragraph 5.1.4.2.   All JTIDS header fields in the signal message shall be filled with non-default meaningful values. Communication between JUs with different fidelity levelsIn the event that participants in a simulated JTIDS network cannot set their respective simulations to operate at a common level of fidelity (i.e. TSA Level) the following procedures apply: If a low fidelity network participant is in a simulated JTIDS network with a higher fidelity NTR, the network participant shall follow the low fidelity synchronization procedures in paragraph 5.1.4.1 skipping the RTT synchronization process, changing directly to the fine synchronization state once it receives a J0.0 initial net entry message from the NTR or any IEJU.  If a higher fidelity network participant is in a simulated JTIDS network with a lower fidelity NTR, the higher fidelity participant shall either follow the low fidelity synchronization procedures in paragraph 5.1.4.1 or achieve fine sync with other high fidelity simulators. This can be accomplished by exchanging RTT-Bs or by passively synchronizing with other available high fidelity simulators.  If no other high fidelity simulators are available to synchronize with, the high fidelity participant shall skip the RTT exchange, and directly enter fine synchronization once the J0.0 is received.If the NTR is a lower fidelity simulation and unable to simulate full NTR duties, the NTR shall still have the ability to transmit net entry messages. The signal message shall be filled in with a J0.0 with zeroed timeslot information. RTT emulation will not be required of low fidelity NTRsA lower fidelity JU entering the net shall use the network synchronization ID received from the NTR/IEJU in its transmission information PDUs.  It will then issue PPLIs at the assigned rate. This is nominally of once every 12 seconds (equivalent to the A-0-6 time slot block), though this can occur at times of up to 24 seconds. All simulators, regardless of fidelity shall accept another terminal’s statement of synchronization capability if the network synchronization ID matches its own network synchronization ID. In a lower fidelity synchronization simulation, non-reception of a PPLI message pair for 60 seconds shall indicate that the unit has fallen out of the datalink. Synchronization procedures shall be re-accomplished--reception of a PPLI message stating fine synchronization must occur before data from the JU will be accepted.Time SynchronizationOne station shall be designated as the NTR.  Network Synchronization IDs shall be uniquely generated by NTRs.  NTRs shall use a random function to generate a 32 bit unsigned integer, using the  timestamp of the time they begin to simulate a NTR as the random key seed.If a system in the real world is capable of acting as NTR, any corresponding simulator shall also be capable, at a minimum, of acting as a low fidelity NTR. If no simulators in a simulated JTIDS net are capable of acting as a NTR, participants shall be able to set the network synchronization ID to zero and transmit the synchronization state of fine synchronization. A zero in the network synchronization ID field shall be accepted as a wildcard matching any network synchronization ID.If a network synchronization ID accompanying received data does not match a JU’s own network synchronization ID, the data shall be considered as having not been received. Simulated terminals shall accept net entry messages (J0.0) from any simulated transmitting terminal within reception range. When medium fidelity synchronization is applicable (TSA Mode level 4), and the net entry message has a network synchronization ID different than the local network synchronization ID, the JU shall revert back to coarse synchronization, use the new network synchronization ID, cease sending TADIL-J data and will attempt re-synchronization with the new network in accordance with the JTIDS terminal specification. If the network synchronization ID (i.e. during changeover of NTR or multiple IEJUs) is the same as the locally held key, the JU will not revert to coarse synchronization status and will not stop transmitting TADIL-J data.If an initial net entry message is received from a unit that does not have a Transmitting Terminal Primary Mode of IEJU or NTR, it shall still be accepted. Depending upon implementation, the simulation operator may be notified so that the sending simulator can correct this error condition.All simulators shall have at least a low fidelity simulation of a terminal clock, potentially independent of the simulator’s (or live equipment’s) clock. Since whatever time an NTR has set is considered correct, an NTR may transmit a time that significantly varies from the actual simulated wall clock. In high fidelity simulators the terminal clock may model the clock drift of an actual JTIDS terminal. It is not expected that terminal clocks will be modeled at a high level of fidelity and the actual level of emulation is left to the implementer. Low Fidelity Synchronization Low fidelity synchronization is applicable to simulation systems interested primarily in providing tactical datalink information as part of an operational scenario.  The low fidelity synchronization procedure allows such systems to exchange Link 16 messages without being encumbered by actual JTIDS transmission and message security requirements.  The NTR shall begin by issuing Net Entry message pairs at a rate in accordance with the JTIDS terminal specification (Typically in timeslot A-0-6 at a rate of every 12 seconds). A unique randomly generated key shall be filled into the network synchronization ID field. The primary JTIDS duty field shall contain a NTR enumeration.The receiving JTIDS Unit Terminal (JU) then updates its own terminal time by taking the terminal perceived time, and adding the amount of time for the message to traverse the distance between the two entities. It also shall fill it’s own network synchronization ID in the with the network synchronization ID received from the NTR. This ID shall be used in all transmission information issued by the JU in the JU’s own network synchronization ID field as long as the JU remains in synchronization with the same NTR.Modulation Parameter 4 (Synchronization State) in the transmission information shall be set to “fine synchronization” after reception of the J0.0 Initial Net Entry message from the IEJU or NTR, corresponding to “fine synchronization.”The first data message that will be sent by a JU entering the network shall be the JUs PPLI.insert state diagramLink 16Medium Fidelity SynchronizationMedium Fidelity Synchronization corresponds to only the high fidelity TSA level 4.  It is applicable to those systems for which simulation of the fine synchronization methodology is paramount, potentially for high fidelity training, network testing and network experimentation. Because the latency of WANs (latencies up to hundreds of milliseconds) are orders of magnitude higher than in a real Link 16 network (latencies up to 3ms), this methodology will not meet the needs of sub-millisecond accuracy. Communities with the need for sub-millisecond accuracy will need to use a centralized server on a real-time operating system to simulate the microsecond intricacies of the JTIDS network. The term “High Fidelity Synchronization” will be reserved for synchronization mechanisms that are able to model the sub-millisecond accuracy of the Link 16 network. The accuracy of the synchronization mechanism shall have an error less than the simulated time of propagation.  The accuracy of the synchronization mechanism must be taken into account when modeling fine synchronization.The Medium Fidelity Synchronization procedure shall follow steps 1 and 2 of the low fidelity synchronization procedure above.  At this point, the JU is considered to have achieved “coarse synchronization.”  The JU shall then transmit the appropriate RTT message (A or B). The synchronization state shall be set to “coarse synchronization.” The JU shall use it’s own terminal perceived time in the perceived transmit time field4.  The appropriate NTR/JU will answer (in accordance with the JTIDS terminal specification), using the JU perceived time and the entity distance to calculate the perceived receive time. The RTT is then transmitted. The transmitting JU shall fill its own terminal perceived time with the received transmit time field. The formula for filling in the receive time in the RTT reply is= EMBED Equation.3  The tdelay is computed by:  EMBED Equation.3  WhereRTtime is the actual time held by the receiving/replying participant (Derived from NTP, GPS, etc)RT terminal is the value of the simulated Link 16 terminal clock at the receiving/replying participantTTtime is the actual time held of transmitting participant (Derived from NTP, GPS, etc)tdelay is the difference between the receiver’s real-time clock at the time of receipt and the sender’s real-time clock at the time of transmission (i.e. it approximates the emulation network latency), andtpropagate is the propagation time of the radio frequency message in the simulated environment.This formula computes the perceived time of receipt by the receiving simulator with respect to the simulated terminal clock of the sender.The originating JU shall then update its own terminal time in accordance with the simulator model and the Link 16 fine synchronization procedures.  After the appropriate number or RTT exchanges have occurred (depending whether the RTT-A or RTT-B method of synchronization was used and the internal terminal simulation model), the JU shall consider itself to be in fine synchronization and shall continually issue RTT message pairs to maintain synchronization at rates specified within the JTIDS terminal specification. Once the terminal emulator model has met the requirements for fine synchronization, normal message transmissions in accordance with MIL STD 6016/STANAG 5516.JTIDS implementation under DISThis section contains the requirements for simulation of JTIDS using the DIS Signal and Transmitter PDU. Forthe DIS Protocol Profiles, transmission and receipt of PDUs, and general service requirements, refer to the IEEE Std. 1278.1a --1998.  In implementing the signal PDU, perceived data should be able to be sent on a configurable port separate from all other DIS data. This allows datalinks to be selectively routed without additional hardware. This also allows for gateways to forward data between legacy DIS datalink formats and the new standardized format.Transmitter PDU DescriptionTable 5.1.1 shows the format for the Transmitter PDU for JTIDS simulation.Transmitter PDUs used in Link 16 simulation shall include all of the standard information, as well as the information described in the modulation fields.  The Transmitter PDU shall contain the following fields.Frequency.  This field shall specify the JTIDS center frequency of 1131000000 for communications mode 1.  For communications mode 2 or 4, then a frequency of 969000000 shall be used.Transmit Frequency Bandwidth.  This field shall contain the bandwidth of the JTIDS signal, simulating the use of the entire frequency band as an average over time.  The field shall be represented by a 32-bit float value of 240000000, unless operating in communications mode 2 or 4, and then a value of 1 shall be used.Modulation Type.  The Modulation Type fields contain enumerations for the major and detail modulation fields:The Spread Spectrum field is a 16-bit Boolean array, and shall be set to 1 for frequency hopping.The Major modulation field is a 16-bit enumeration, and shall be set to 7 for Carrier Phase Shift Modulation.The detail modulation field is a 16-bit enumeration, and shall contain a 0.The System field is a 16-bit enumeration, and shall be set to 7 for JTIDS/MIDS Crypto System. For Link 16 simulation under this standard this field shall be set to zero.  Crypto Key ID.  For Link 16 simulation under this standard this field shall be set to zero.  Length of Modulation Parameters.  These fields shall specify the length in octets of the modulation parameters that follow this field.  This length shall be set to 16, representing 16 octets for the DIS J Transmitter PDU.Modulation Parameters.  These fields shall specify the modulation type specific characteristics of the Transmitter PDU.  Modulation Parameter 1 shall contain the TSA mode with an enumeration of 0-4 for fidelity level 0-4 as described in section 5.1.2.  Modulation Parameter 2 shall contain the transmitting terminal’s primary mode.  Setting the enumeration to 1 shall indicate that the entity is the NTR.  Setting it to 2 shall indicate that the entity is a JU participant.Modulation Parameter 3 shall contain the transmitting terminal’s secondary mode, with the following enumerations: 0=None, 1=Net Position Reference, 2=Primary Navigation Controller, 3=Secondary Navigation Controller.Modulation Parameter 4 shall contain the synchronization state.  For TSA mode level 0-3 this shall be set to 2 for “fine synchronization.”  For Fidelity level 4, it is initially set to 1 for “coarse” synchronization and the procedures in section 5.4.1.2 for high-fidelity synchronization are followed.Modulation Parameter 5 shall contain the Network Synchronization ID.  For TSA modes 0-2, it shall be set to default.  For TSA modes 3-4, it shall be a 32-bit random integer generated by using the DIS timestamp as the seed. Only an NTR can generate a Network Synchronization ID; all other participants shall use the ID obtained from the NTR to which they are synchronized.Table 5.2.1: Transmitter PDU for TADIL – JField Size (bits)Transmitter PDU FieldsDescription96PDU HeaderProtocol Version8 bit enumeration Exercise ID8 bit unsigned integer PDU Type8 bit enumeration Protocol Family8 bit enumeration Timestamp32 bit unsigned integer Length16 bit unsigned integer Padding16 bits unused 48Entity IDSite16 bit unsigned integer Application16 bit unsigned integer Entity16 bit unsigned integer 16Radio ID 16 bit unsigned integerShall contain the ID of the radio transmitting the signal.64Radio Entity TypeEntity Kind8 bit enumeration Domain8 bit enumeration Country 16 bit enumeration Category8 bit enumeration Nomenclature Version8 bit enumeration Nomenclature16 bit enumeration 8Transmit State 8 bit enumeration 8Input Source 8 bit enumeration 16Padding 16 bits unused 192Antenna LocationX component64 bit floating point Y component64 bit floating point Z component64 bit floating point 96Relative Antenna Locationx component32 bit floating point y component32 bit floating point z component32 bit floating point 16Antenna Pattern Type 16 bit enumeration 16Antenna Pattern Length 16 bit unsigned integer 64Frequency 64 bit unsigned integer64 Bit Int: 1131000000 (center frequency) Or unless operating in Communications mode 2 or 4, then 96900000032Transmit Frequency Bandwidth 32 bit floating point32 Bit Float: 240000000 unless in Communications mode 2 or 4, then 300000032Power 32 bit floating point 64Modulation TypeSpread Spectrum16 bit Boolean array1: Frequency HoppingMajor 16 bit enumerationNew Modulation—7: Carrier Phase Shift Modulation (CPSM)Detail16 bit enumerationSystem16 bit enumerationInteger Enumeration: 7 = JTIDS/MIDS16Crypto System 16 bit enumeration16Crypto Key ID 16 bit unsigned integer8Length of Modulation Parameters 8 bit unsigned integer 24Padding 24 bits unused 8Modulation Parameter #1Time Slot Allocation Mode8 bit enumerationInteger enumeration 0-48Modulation Parameter #2Transmitting Terminal Primary Mode 8 bit enumerationInteger Enumeration: 1-NTR 2-JTIDS Unit Participant8Modulation Parameter #3Transmitting Terminal Secondary Mode 8 bit enumerationInteger Enumeration: 0=None 1-Net Position Reference 2-Primary Navigation Controller 3-Secondary Navigation Controller8Modulation Parameter #4Synchronization State8 bit enumerationInteger Enumeration: 2=Coarse Synchronization3=Fine Synchronization32Modulation Parameter #5Network Synchronization ID 32 bit unsigned integer32 bit random number, use the DIS timestamp as the seedSignal PDU DescriptionTable 5.2.2 below shows the format for the Signal PDU.

It is therefore almost certain that the HLA implementation of the Link 16 protocol will form part of a larger Federation Object Model (FOM). The HLA implementation of Link 16 is therefore defined as a Base Object Model (BOM), as described in BOM Study Group Final Report: (SISOREF0052001). A BOM is defined as "a single aspect of simulation interplay that can be used as a building block" within a FOM.The Link 16 BOM is described in the Object Model Template (OMT) in the XML based IEEE 1516 OMT format At the time of writing this standard many federations still use the older HLA 1.3 standards, so the Link 16 BOM is also described in OMT 1.3 format.  The complete OMT tables may be found at the SISO web site.The Link 16 BOMThe Link 16 BOM is intended to describe how to implement a simulation of the Link 16 Tactical Data Link (TDL) and its associated message set, TADIL-J, within a High Level Architecture (HLA) simulation. The Link 16 BOM is intended to be integrated within the Federation Object Model (FOM) of the HLA federation.The Link 16 BOM assumes that the parent FOM has the following properties: contains all current DIS Transmitter PDU parameters as part of object class hierarchy contains all current DIS Signal PDU parameters as part of interaction class hierarchyConventions within the Link 16 BOM in OMT 1.3 format follow those adopted by the RPR FOM. Many of these conventions are intended to address some of the shortcomings of the OMT 1.3 format (these have been address in the IEEE 1516.2 specification). These include: All names have the initial letter of each word capitalized (except when the word follows an abbreviation which is itself capitalized) All enumeration names end in the text "Enum" followed by a number. The number indicates the number of bits in the enumerated valueAll complex data type names end in the text "Struct"Protocol Implementation Details The HLA protocol implementation details are directly equivalent to the corresponding details for DIS.  References to the modulation parameters of the Transmitter PDU are modified to refer to the fields of the attribute of the JTIDSTransmitterStruct complex data type (see section 2.8). References to other fields of the Transmitter PDU are modified to refer to fields of the assumed parent object class that is equivalent to the Transmitter PDU (see assumption 1). References to the data fields of the Signal PDU are modified to refer to parameter of the TDLBinaryRadioSignal interaction (or its subclasses). References to other fields of the Signal.PDU are modified to refer to the parameters of the assumed parent Radio Signal interaction (see assumption 2 above).Levels of Fidelity This section defines the levels of fidelity for Link 16 BOM compliant federates. The HLA levels of fidelity are directly equivalent to the corresponding DIS levels of fidelity as defined in section 5.1.2.References to the modulation parameters of the Transmitter PDU are modified to refer to the fields of the attribute of the JTIDSTransmitterStruct complex data type (see section  REF _Ref20503604 \r \h 0). References to the Signal PDU are modified to refer to the parameters of the TDLBinaryRadioSignal interaction (or its subclasses).Time Synchronization (HLA)This section defines how Link 16 BOM compliant federates achieve the required (simulated) Link 16 time synchronization. The HLA time synchronization mechanism is directly equivalent to the corresponding mechanism for DIS as defined in section 5.1.References to the Transmitter PDU are modified to refer to the fields of the attribute of the JTIDSTransmitterStruct complex data type (see section  REF _Ref20503604 \r \h 0). References to the Signal PDU are modified to refer to the parameters of the TDLBinaryRadioSignal interaction (or its subclasses).Protocol Implementation Details (HLA)This section defines how Link 16 BOM compliant federates are to implement the Link 16 protocol. The HLA protocol implementation details are directly equivalent to the corresponding details for DIS as defined in section TBD.References to the modulation parameters of the Transmitter PDU are modified to refer to the fields of the attribute of the JTIDSTransmitterStruct complex data type (see section 5.2). References to other fields of the Transmitter PDU are modified to refer to fields of the assumed parent object class that is equivalent to the Transmitter PDU (see assumption a). References to the data fields of the Signal PDU are modified to refer to parameter of the TDLBinaryRadioSignal interaction (or its subclasses). References to other fields of the Signal PDU are modified to refer to the parameters of the assumed parent Radio Signal interaction (see assumption b).Object Class DataThe Link 16 BOM defines no new object classes. Instead the BOM defines a single complex data type (JTIDSTransmitterStruct) that corresponds to the modulation parameters in the DIS Transmitter PDU defined in section 5.2.2. An attribute of this complex data type should be added to the object class in the parent FOM corresponding to the DIS Transmitter PDU - see assumption a).Interaction Class DataThe Link 16 BOM adds a family of interactions. In order to support future TDL implementation of other data links the parent interaction is generic - the TDLBinaryRadioSignal interaction. This interaction contains no parameters (and is neither publishable nor subscribable). The intention is that the TDLBinaryRadioSignal interaction becomes a subclass of the parent FOM's equivalent of the DIS signal PDU - see assumptions b).The Link16RadioSignal interaction, a subclass of the TDLBinaryRadioSignal interaction, contains the JTIDS network header as described in section 5.2.3. Subclasses of this interaction define the different types of Link 16 messages.BOM ImplementationThe BOM implementation, in OTM 1.3 format, is described in annex A.Adding the Link 16 BOM to the RPR FOMA field of type TDLBinaryRadioSignal is added to the SpreadSpectrumStruct complex data type. Is cardinality is 0-1.The TDLBinaryRadioSignal interaction is added as a subclass of a new interaction, the TDLRadioSignal interaction, which itself is a subclass of the RPR FOM's RadioSignal interaction. The additional TDLRadioSignal interaction is necessary due to a limitation of the RPR FOM implementation of the DIS Signal PDU. Section TBD defines that the DIS Signal PDU used for all Link 16 messages is a Raw Binary Signal PDU. The RPR FOM equivalent of this PDU type (the RawBinaryRadioSignal interaction) contains a parameter, called SignalData, containing one or more octets containing the signal data. Using this interaction directly would mean that the structure of the actual Link 16 message would be lost. An alternative implementation where the Link 16 interaction becomes a subclass of the RawBinaryRadioSignal interaction means that the Signal Data is not used - this could cause difficulties for DIS to HLA gateways, although the interaction contains the required message structure.The proposed solution also means that DIS to HLA gateways need to be modified, but the modifications are well defined (DIS Raw Binary Signal PDUs need to be teed into either a RawBinaryRadioSignal interaction or a TDLBinaryRadioSignal interaction dependant on the TDL type. Conversely the gateway must merge both interaction types into a single DIS Signal PDU).ANNEX A: Link 16 Base Object Model (BOM) OMT TablesObject Model Identification TableCategoryInformationNameLink 16 BOMVersionv1.0 Draft 2Date9/9/2002PurposeLink 16 Base Object Model (BOM)Application DomainC4ISR & C2 platform simulationsSponsorSISOPOC (Title, First, Last)MrGraham CShanksPOC OrganizationAMSPOC Telephone+44 1383 828062POC Emailgraham.shanks@amsjv.comObject Interaction TableInteraction1Interaction2Interaction3Interaction4Parent (N)       TDLBinaryRadioSignal (N)       Link16RadioSignal (R)       JTIDSRadioSignal (IR)RTTABRadioSignal (IR)RTTReplyRadioSignal (IR)JTIDSVoiceCVSDRadioSignal (IR)JTIDSVoiceLPC10RadioSignal (IR)JTIDSVoiceLPC12RadioSignal (IR)JTIDSLETradioSignal (IR)VMFRadioSignal (IR)Parameter TableInteractionParameterDatatypeCardinalityUnits ResolutionAccuracyAccuracy ConditionRouting SpaceJTIDSLETradioSignalLETheaderLETheaderStruct1N/AN/AN/AN/AN/A TADILJmessageTADILJwordStruct1+N/AN/AN/AN/A JTIDSRadioSignalJTIDSheaderJTIDSheaderStruct1N/AN/AN/AN/AN/A TADILJmessageTADILJwordStruct1+N/AN/AN/AN/A JTIDSVoiceCVSDRadioSignalJTIDSheaderJTIDSheaderStruct1N/AN/AN/AN/AN/A Dataoctet29+N/AN/Aperfectalways JTIDSVoiceLPC10RadioSignalJTIDSheaderJTIDSheaderStruct1N/AN/AN/AN/AN/A Dataoctet29+N/AN/Aperfectalways JTIDSVoiceLPC12RadioSignalJTIDSheaderJTIDSheaderStruct1N/AN/AN/AN/AN/A Dataoctet29+N/AN/Aperfectalways Link16RadioSignalNPGnumberunsigned short1N/AN/AperfectalwaysN/A NetNumberoctet1N/AN/Aperfectalways  TSEC_CVLLoctet1N/AN/Aperfectalways  MSEC_CVLLoctet1N/AN/Aperfectalways  TimeslotIDunsigned long1N/AN/Aperfectalways  PerceivedTransmitTime [2]long long1N/AN/Aperfectalways RTTABRadioSignalRTTABRTTABStruct1N/AN/AN/AN/AN/AVMFRadioSignalJTIDSheaderJTIDSheaderStruct1N/AN/AN/AN/AN/A TADILJmessageTADILJwordStruct1+N/AN/AN/AN/A Enumerated Datatypes TableIdentifierEnumeratorRepresentationJTIDSprimaryModeEnum8 [1]NTR1 JTIDSUnitParticipant2JTIDSsecondaryModeEnum8 [1]None0 NetPositionReference1 PrimaryNavigationController2 SecondaryNavigationController3JTIDSsynchronizationStateEnum8 [1]CourseSynchronization1 FineSynchronization2TSAlevelEnum8 [1]LowFidelityLevel00 LowFidelityLevel11 MediumFidelityLevel22 MediumFidelityLevel33 HighFidelityLevel44Complex Datatypes tableComplex DatatypeField NmaeDatatypeCardinalityUnitsResolutionAccuracyAccuracy ConditionJTIDSheaderStructDataoctet6N/AN/AperfectalwaysJTIDStransmitterStructTimeSlotAlocationModeTSAlevelEnum81N/AN/AN/AN/A TransmittingTerminalPrimaryModeJTIDSprimaryModeEnum81N/AN/AN/AN/A TransmittingTerminalSecondaryModeJTIDSsecondaryModeEnum81N/AN/AN/AN/A SynchronizationStateJTIDSsynchronizationStateEnum81N/AN/AN/AN/A NetworkSynchronizationIDunsigned long1N/AN/AperfectalwaysLETheaderStructDataoctet6N/AN/AperfectalwaysRTTABStructDataoctet6N/AN/AperfectalwaysRTTreplyStructDataoctet6N/AN/AperfectalwaysTADILJwordStructDataoctet10N/AN/AperfectalwaysNotes TableIDText1This is an 8-bit enumeration2NTP timestamp format-- NTP timestamps are represented as a 64-bit unsigned fixed-point number, in seconds relative to 0h on 1 January 1900.

In Feb 96 the (then) Ad Hoc Working Group (AHWG) on NATO Common Interoperability Standards (NCIS) Testing decided that there was a requirement to define a single interface standard to support the second of the above levels of testing. This resulted in the development of a standard called the Standard Implementation for Multiple Platform Link Evaluation (SIMPLE), STANAG 5602 (Reference A).  This STANAG defines a protocol to provide the means for geographically (national and international) separated TDL assets (C4ISR, C2 and non-C2 platform test rigs) to exchange environment data and TDL messages in order to conduct detailed TDL IO testing. The STANAG supports the exchange of all current TDLs but predominantly the development and testing was orientated around Link 16.  Consequently the emphasis of this paper is on Link 16 aspects of the STANAG, although the principles are the same for any other TDL message set that is exchanged across a SIMPLE network.SIMPLE Methodologies In order to conduct IO testing using live platform test rigs hosting operational host software two basic requirements have to be met:Firstly, the platform rigs need to be connected via a suitable and secure medium.Secondly, a methodology was required to exchange network, simulated entities (environment data) and TDL messages.It was found that the IEEE 1278 .1 & 1a (Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS)) standards (References B & C) did not provide the means to fulfil the second requirement in its entirety, as it did not specify Protocol Data Units (PDUs) that would support the exchange of TDL messages.  However, there were several PDUs which provided the means to fulfil the requirement to exchange simulated entities (environment data).Therefore, so as to reduce the risk and development time, it was recommended that an existing standard, the SPAWAR Gateway protocol, which supported the exchange of TDL messages, should form the baseline for a new standard. TDL PacketsIn SIMPLE the methodology for exchanging TDL messages is to take the host generated message traffic from the MIDS/JTIDS terminal interface and repackage it for transmission across the SIMPLE network.  The receiving SIMPLE node extracts the TDL message traffic from the received packet and presents it to the host interface as if it had been received from a MIDS/JTIDS terminal.  DIS PDU PacketsA new packet definition (DIS PDU Packet) was added to the baseline protocol to support the exchange of PDUs for simulated entities (environment data).The content of SIMPLE DIS PDU packet remains faithful to the definitions in the IEEE standards, indeed part of the CM process for STANAG 5602 requires that the these standards be monitored to ensure that all amendments are reviewed and recommended for adoption as required.Although the SIMPLE community does not directly join or interact with the Simulation community it was felt that this alignment process was essential in the event, as is now the case, that PDUs to support the exchange of TDL messages were developed.  This would greatly reduce the effort and risk should it be decided to align the SIMPLE testing environment with the simulation environment by employing a single standard.How the TDL TESTing community employs dis In the SIMPLE testing environment simulated entities are normally generated centrally and distributed to all participants. These entities represent environment categories of Air, Surface (Maritime) Subsurface (Maritime), Land (Ground) and Space.  It should be noted that in many instances it is not necessary to generate entities to conduct IO testing and are generally only required to undertake testing associated with position such as TDL correlation.The IEEE DIS standard provides a large number PDUs many of which are not appropriate for SIMPLE testing, therefore the catalogue was categorised into three major groups, those that were mandatory, those that were desirable and those that were optional.The PDUs that were considered mandatory for transmission and reception are: Entity StateStart/ResumeStop/FreezeAcknowledgeThere are two DIS PDUs that are classified as desirable for transmission and reception, the Electromagnetic Emissions and IFF/ATC/NAVAIDS (only layer 1 of this PDU is implemented) and to date only the latter PDU has been utilised. The remaining PDUs were categorised as optional for implementation. SIMPLE Interpretation of PDUsThe IEEE standard and the SISO Enumerations document define the fields and field values with the requirements of the simulation community in mind.  However, it has been found in practice their use in the SIMPLE testing environment are more specific and therefore, the STANAG provides guidance by annotating as mandatory where a valid, non-default value of a field shall be transmitted and optionally where a non-default value of a field may be transmitted. This philosophy was also extended to the specific field values so that implementers were not required to implement values that would never be used in the SIMPLE testing environment.  Three of the four mandatory PDUs have been clarified in this manner and are described below:Entity State PDUThis PDU is used to promulgate entities created by the scenario generator to other participants in a SIMPLE environment.  If a new entity is created in the scenario an ENTITY STATE PDU will be generated.  Whilst an entity exists in the scenario the normal rules for PDU generation and maintenance are extant.  When the scenario generator removes an entity then the PDU will cease being generated.  This simplistic approach obviates the need to implement the CREATE and REMOVE PDUs for the SIMPLE environment.The ENTITY-KIND field for this PDU has a range of 0-7 but in the SIMPLE environment only the following values are utilised with the indicated categorisation. ValueKindImp1PlatformM2MunitionOThe DOMAIN field identifies the Domain of the Entity Type and in the SIMPLE environment only the following values are utilised with the indicated categorisation.PlatformValueDomainImp1LandM2AirM3SurfaceM4SubsurfaceO5SpaceOMunitionValueDomainImp0 -11AllOStop/Freeze PDUThe use of this PDU in the SIMPLE environment is designed to provide the capability to terminate or to freeze a simulation.  When a scenario is terminated it can only be started again from the beginning.  To support this requirement the following field definitions shall be used in the SIMPLE environmentThe REASON field has a range of 0-8 but only the following values are utilised with the indicated categorisation (any other value is invalid).  To terminate a scenario the field is set to = 2.  To freeze all entities at all sites i.e. a scenario freeze the field is set to = 1.  When the field = 1 it shall be used in conjunction with the FROZEN BEHAVIOUR field described below.BitReason to StopImp1RecessM2TerminationMWhen invoked the FROZEN BEHAVIOUR field is Mandatory and shall only be used to freeze all entities at all sites and is achieved by setting the field value = 0.  This will stop the simulation clock, cease transmitting any data on simulated entities and cease updating positions of existing entities. Start/Resume PDUFor the SIMPLE environment this PDU shall only be used to instruct all entities at all sites to leave a frozen state to begin participating in the simulation.  This will be achieved by setting the RECEIVING ENTITY ID field to the maximum value i.e. all bits set. What methodologies/interpretations will be necessary?Transmitter PDUThe premise upon which TDL IO testing is carried out in the SIMPLE environment is to interconnect live platform rigs to determine the level of IO for that combination of platforms and test criteria.  This premise would not change should the SIMPLE community adopt the DIS-J proposal.  MIDS/JTIDS terminals are not normally part of the configuration for undertaking TDL IO Testing.  Terminals are replaced with an emulator that provides only sufficient fidelity to ensure host/terminal and terminal/host-interfacing requirements are met, which can be different for each platform.  The emulator also undertakes PPLI generation and terminal Receipt/Compliance (R/C) processing.  A SIMPLE converter would then interface the emulator for the transmission and reception of the SIMPLE packets to and from other participants.For this reason it is likely that the Transmitter PDU would not be utilised except as a precursor to a Signal PDU, as it is not a requirement for undertaking TDL IO testing to emulate the JTIDS/MIDS terminal to such a high degree of fidelityAt reference D it states that a Transmitter PDU shall be issued in four instances all of which are required to establish or terminate a simulated JTIDS network. A simulated JTIDS network is not required in order to undertake TDL IO testing in a SIMPLE environment.  Therefore, if the Transmitter PDU were to be implemented in the interests of commonality with the simulation environment, one view would be that the PDU would only be issued when a participant commences or ceases generating Link 16 messages.  In this case TSA mode would be set to the lowest level of fidelity and all the remaining data item fields set to defaults.  However, that said, the decision on whether to implement the Transmitter PDU would rest with the TDL IO Testing Syndicate.Signal PDUThe Signal PDU could potentially replace the various TDL Packets relating to Link 16 currently employed to exchange TDL message traffic in the SIMPLE environment.  An initial assessment shows that the Signal PDU would fulfil the requirements for TDL IO testing. However, that said, the decision on whether to implement the Signal PDU would rest with the TDL IO Testing Syndicate.Data items mapping between the two protocolstransmitter pduThe SIMPLE methodology does not employ an equivalent packet to the Transmitter PDU but it is expected that this PDU shall be sent at the beginning and end of a transmission with multiple Signal PDUs in between.Although there is no data item mapping that can be undertaken for this PDU the data item implementations do need to reflect the unique environment in which it will be employed.  The table below represents one suggestion for the implementation of the data items for use in the SIMPLE environment.   The finalisation of the data item implementation will require a consensus from both the Simulation and SIMPLE communities.Transmitter PDU FieldsSimple ImplementationPDU HeaderProtocol VersionThis field shall be set to value 6 (IEEE 1278.1a-1998).Exercise IDSee Reference IEEE 1278.1a-1998PDU TypeThis value shall be set in accordance with the PDU Type being reported.Protocol FamilyThis value shall be set in accordance with the PDU Type being reported.TimestampAbsolute time stamping shall be used.

However, in many instances where there is no direct relationship between data items they are either redundant, used for error checking (SIMPLE currently uses a byte Bi-Synchronous transfer protocol) or not considered applicable for TDL IO testing.This initial attempt at mapping the data items is only the first iteration and should form the basis for further technical discussion.Message Type = 0 (JTIDS Header/ Link 16 Message) vs SIMPLE Packet Type = 1 Link 16 messagesSignal PDUSIMPLE Packet Type = 1 Link 16 messages (Note 1)FieldBitsRemarksFieldBitsRemarksNPG Number16NPG Number16Net Number8Net No.8TSEC CVLL8No Equivalent Field and N/A  for SIMPLEMSEC CVLL8No Equivalent Field and N/A  for SIMPLEMessage Type Identifier8Type 0 - JTIDS header and messageType 1 - RTT A/BType 2 - RTT ReplyType 3 – 5  JTIDS VoiceType 6 – LETType 7 - VMFNo Direct equivalent.

This group is the successor to the  SISO Tactical Data Link Study Group, which  began as a “grass roots” response to informal community inquiries by TACCSF.  The Study Group presented a DIS implementation of Tactical Data Link at the Fall 2003 SIW. This protocol would not have been possible without the contributions and hard work of each of its members. IntroductionJTIDS is a communications, navigation and identification system intended to exchange surveillance and command and control (C2) information among various C2 platforms and weapons platforms to enhance varied missions of each of the services. It provides multiple access, high capacity, jam resistant, digital data and secure voice communication, navigation and Identification (CNI) information to a variety of platforms.  JTIDS is the primary NATO standard for tactical datalink. NATO STANAG 5516/MIL STD 6016B describes the TADIL-J message formats and JTIDS network instructions. 	There are immediate operational requirements for existing military simulations to exchange TADIL-J/JTIDS data using a single interoperable standard. As military distributed simulation evolves further in mission scale and complexity, tactical datalink implementations need to interoperate.  The objective of this standard is to establish a single format to exchange TADIL-J messages, and to emulate a JTIDS radio frequency network.    In developing a protocol for simulating JTIDS in DIS and HLA, it is recognized that there are widely varying requirements for achieving fidelity amongst different users.  This protocol attempts to establish procedures that may be used by the vast majority of users, by establishing discrete, scalable, interoperable levels of fidelity for different users.  This in turn, allows for low cost initial implementation with a path toward upgrading to detailed JTIDS emulation as requirements evolveThe DIS simulation protocol for JTIDS is described in terms of the established DIS Transmitter and Signal PDUs.  There has been no change to the IEEE 1278.1 – 1995 standard fields for the Transmitter or Signal PDUs.  JTIDS specific enumerations have been created to populate the standard fields. The implementation of JTIDS exploits the fact that both these PDUs are variable length.  In the case of the Transmitter PDUs, this protocol sets forth how the variable length “modulation parameter” fields must be populated.   In the case of the Signal PDU, JTIDS specific information is relegated to the variable length data fields. The HLA instructions are formatted in compliance with the IEEE 1516 standard for HLA.  The instructions are presented in the form of a Base Object Model (BOM) that may be incorporated into a system FOM. RPR-FOM based simulations should be able to easily integrate the Link-16 BOM into their FOMs.  Furthermore, there is a straightforward mapping between the DIS PDU implementations and the corresponding BOM components.ScopeIt is the objective of this protocol to establish a standard for TADIL-J message exchange and JTIDS network simulation in the DIS and HLA interoperability frameworks. The intent is to prescribe the content of the standard fields of the Transmitter and Signal PDUs and establish procedures for their use.  Compliance with these procedures will facilitate interoperability amongst JTIDS simulation systems.  ReferencesIEEE 1278.1 – 1995 IEEE Standard for Distributed Interactive Simulation – Application ProtocolsIEEE 1516 –2001 IEEE Standard for Modeling and Simulation (M&S) High Level Architecture (HLA)MIL-STD-6016B, Tactical Digital Information Link (TADIL) J Message Standard (DRAFT) 15 March 2002NATO STANAG 5602, edition 1, Standard Interface for Multiple Platform Link Evaluation (SIMPLE) 20 Feb 2001System Segment Specification for Joint Tactical Information Distribution System Class 2 Terminal, 15 April 1999STANAG 5516, Edition 1, Tactical Data Exchange - LINK 16, Ratified 15 January 1997.LINK-16 Enhanced Throughput Standard, August 11, 1998 Doc # VSD-618255-97-339-02Joint Interoperability of Tactical Command and Control Systems Variable Message Format (VMF) Technical Interface Design Plan (Test Edition) Reissue 2, August 1996.Time Synchronization Server,  HYPERLINK "http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~ntp/" http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~ntp/Terms, Definitions and ConventionConventionsThe following terms and conventions are used for the purpose of this standard:SHALL indicate a procedure or capability is mandatory.SHOULD indicates a recommended procedure or capabilityMAY indicates a procedure or capability is optional.WILL/IS/ARE generally used descriptively for information purposes.Terms and DefinitionsAutomatic Acknowledgement:  A machine verification function whereby a terminal that receives a message addressed to it retransmits a copy of that message back to the source during a later time slot, verifying the receipt of the original message.Epoch: A 12.8-minute time interval consisting of 98,304 time slot intervals, each of 7.8125 milliseconds duration. The time slots in each epoch are organized into three sets (A, B, or C) of 32, 768 time slots each. There are 112.5 epochs in a 24-hour period. Free Text Message:  Bit-oriented messages whose information bits may be used to represent digitized voice, teletype and other forms of free text information.

Geodetic Position Quality is reported as an integer from 0-15 where the higher numbers correspond to the higher qualities, i.e., lower errors in position. JTIDS Header (Message):  The leading bits of each message are coded as a (16, 7) Reed-Solomon code word that provides 35 bits of information. Initial Entry:  The procedure by which a subscriber terminal becomes a system participant initially and may achieve coarse synchronization with system time. Initial Entry JTIDS Unit (IEJU):  Any JTIDS/MIDS unit that transmits the Initial Entry message in the appropriate time slot.JTIDS Joint Tactical Information Distribution System: The JTIDS/ MIDS is a joint-service system which provides an Integrated Communications, Navigation, and Identification (ICNI) capability. The JTIDS/MIDS provides a reliable, secure, jam resistant, high- capacity, ICNI capability through the use of direct-sequence, spread- spectrum, frequency-hopping, and error detection and correction techniques. JTIDS/MIDS Net:  One of 128 time-division structures comprising a JTIDS/MIDS network.

All nets are synchronized so that each time slot of each net is time-coincident with the corresponding time slot (same set and number) of every other net.The signal characteristics of all data distributed within a specified multi-netted structure are determined by a cryptographic variable in conjunction with a set of net numbers that define the structure.JTIDS/MIDS Unit (JU): A unit communicating directly on Link 16. JU is used within the context of this standard to indicate a simulated TADIL-J terminal.Link 16 Message:  See TADIL-J Machine Receipt: See Automatic AcknowledgementMode 1 Communications: Mode 1 JTIDS/MIDS transmissions consist of a sequence of wide-band transmission symbol packets (single pulse, 13-microsecond packets and double-pulse, 26-microsecond packets), the pulses of which are formed by continuous phase shift modulation (CPSM) of the carrier frequency. The signal processing required to transform base-band data to the JTIDS signal waveforms for transmission includes base-band data encryption, forward error correction encoding, error detection encoding, cyclic code shift keying (CCSK) encoding, data symbol interleaving, and the selection of a variable start time.Mode 2 Communications: Mode 2 JTIDS/MIDS transmissions are identical to Mode 1, except that Mode 2 operates in the narrow-band mode.Mode 4 Communications: Mode 4 JTIDS/MIDS transmissions have signal waveform characteristics identical to Mode 2, except that Mode 4 does not employ base-band data encryption signal processing.Navigation Controller: The Navigation Controller establishes the origin and North orientation of the U, V relative grid for the Relative Navigation function. Needline/Network Participation Group (NPG):  The Needline Participation Group is a unique list of netted subscribers compiled without regard to the specific messages they exchange with each other. This list is a means of transmitting any message to a common set of users.  The Network Participation Group is a unique list of applicable messages used to support an agreed- upon technical function without regard to subscriber identities. This list is a means of transmitting a common set of messages to all interested users. For the purposes of simulation in this standard, the NPG number creates virtual networks of participants to segregate information within a JTIDS/MIDS network. Net: Net See "JTIDS/MIDS Net."Net Number:  A 7-bit code that identifies each net as a decimal number (0 through127). Network: See "JTIDS/MIDS Network."Network Time Reference (NTR):  A subscriber terminal that is assigned as the reference for system time for each synchronized netted system. The NTR terminal's clock time is never updated by system information and is the reference to which all other terminals synchronize their own clocks. There is only one NTR.Position Reference:  One or more JUs designated as a network reference. Such a JU has maintained a geodetic position accuracy of 50 feet, one sigma (standard deviation) over a long period of time.Pulse  (JTIDS): A 6.4-microsecond burst of carrier frequency continuous phase shift modulated at a 5-megabit-per-second rate by the transmission symbol. Precise Participant Location & Identification (PPLI): The PPLI function provides network participation status, identification, and position of JUs on the Link 16 interface. Radio Silence Mode:  A mode of terminal operation where the terminal receives but does not transmit fixed word format or variable message format messages.Recurrence Rate: The total number of time slots per epoch assigned (or deleted) in a single time block assignment, specified as an integer, R = 0 to 15 where 2 = the number of time slots. Recurrence Rate Number (RRN): An integer R, O < R < 15, where 2 R is the recurrence rate of the block assignment. Reed-Solomon (R-S) Code:  As applied to JTIDS/MIDS, a forward error correction encoding scheme.

To make use of Relnav, the simulation system must achieve high fidelity synchronization (paragraph 5.4.2)Relative Position Quality: A measure of the quality of a terminal's relative position with respect to the U, V relative grid. Relative Position Quality is reported in the terminal's Position and Status Reports as an integer from 0-15, where the higher qualities, i.e., less error in position. Reporting Responsibility: The requirement for the IU with the best positional data on a track to transmit track data on the interface.Round-Trip-Timing (RTT):  The process used by a JTIDS/MIDS terminal to directly determine the offset between its clock and that of another JTIDS/MIDS terminal. This is used to achieve and maintain fine synchronization and to improve the terminal's time quality. This process involves the exchange of RTT Interrogation and Reply Messages. RTT Addressed  (RTT A):  The RTT A message provides the means for a JTIDS Terminal to synchronize with system time using the active synchronization procedure.   A specific terminal with a time quality greater than the interrogating terminal is interrogated and responds with the RTT Reply. Typically the interrogating terminal addresses the NTR.RTT Broadcast (RTT B):  The RTT B message provides the means for a JTIDS Terminal to synchronize with the system time using the active synchronization procedure.  The RTT B message is not addressed to a specific terminal. The interrogating terminal transmits the RTT B message on the net number of the highest time quality PPLI that it has received. Any terminal with a time quality equal or higher than that net number shall reply.RTT Reply:  The RTT reply message provides the means for th JTIDS terminal to support the active synchronization procedure by providing time-of-arrival data in response to either an RTT-A or RTT-B interrogation.Stacked Net: The coordinated use of specific blocks of time slots on different nets in a JTIDS/MIDS network by different communities of users.Subscriber:  A participant in the use of the system, either actively (transmission of information) or passively (receiver of information only), or both. Synchronization: Active Synchronization: A procedure used by a JTIDS/MIDS terminal to effect and maintain fine synchronization with system time based on the Round-Trip-Timing (RTT) processPassive Synchronization:  A procedure used by a terminal to effect and maintain fine synchronization with system time by passive observations of Position and Status messages transmitted by other terminals.

Time Quality is reported as an integer from 0-15 where the higher numbers correspond to the higher levels of quality, i.e., lower errors in timing. (System Segment Specification for JTIDS/ MIDS Class 2 Terminal)Time Slot:  A 7.8125-millisecond time interval during which messages may be transmitted. Time Slot Assignment (TSA): The designation to the terminal of the specific time slot block in which it will transmit or receive messages.Time Slot Block:  A collection of time slots spaced uniformly in time over each epoch and belonging to a single time slot set. A block is defined by indexing time slot number (0 to 32,767), set (A, B, or C), and a recurrence rate number (0 to 15).Time Slot Number:  A 17-bit code that identifies each full time slot. The code consisting of a 2-bit set field (set A, B, or C) and a 15-bit slot field representing the decimal numbers zero to 32,767. (System Segment Specification for JTIDS/MIDS Class 2 Terminal)Track Quality: A measure of the reliability of the positional information of a reported track.TSA mode:  In this protocol a TSA mode corresponds one of five selectable levels of fidelity.  UsersPrimary User:  A subscriber terminal that utilizes the active synchronization (RTT) procedure and serves as a high- quality source for synchronization by the general Relative Navigation community. Secondary User: The general category for the majority of system subscriber terminals.

Each timeslot is 7.8125 milliseconds long with 128 time slots per second. Timeslots are organized into three interleaved sets (A, B, and C).  An epoch is 12.8 minutes long comprised of 32K timeslots.  There are 112.5 epochs in a 24-hour day.  Therefore, the current epoch, set and timeslot number can be calculated from the current time.  Operationally, groups of timeslots are assigned to a common function known as a network participation group (NPG).  Timeslot assignments are published in a Network Data Load (by a central net design agency), with participation groups identified y the timeslot set, the “offset” of the timeslot, and the timeslot repetition rate.  The repetition rate is expressed as n exponential power of 2, representing how often the timeslot assigned to the NPG occurs within the set.    TDMA architecture requires that each JTIDS participant, known as a JTIDS Unit (JU) know when its transmit timeslots occur. JUs must be synchronized with a common network time to receive and transmit on the network.  In JTIDS, one JU in a Network is designated as the Network Time Reference (NTR).   General RequirementsThis section describes general requirement for simulation of Link-16 independent of the simulation protocol used. The specific implementation under DIS is described in section 5.2.  The specific requirements for implementation under HLA are described in section 5.3. Simulators in compliance with this standard shall at a minimum have the capability to identify the NPG and net number of transmitted data to allow them to operate at TSA mode level 0 and 1. All TADIL-J messages shall be bit encoded in accordance with the MIL STD 6016B TADIL-J specification. In the specification, each timeslot contains one 35-bit header, padded to 48 bits and a varying number of 75 bit messages unless the message type indicator specifies otherwise. Regardless of level of fidelity, all transmission modulation parameter fields shall be filled with meaningful data. When the header indicates Reed-Solomon encoding, the data area is still comprised of non Reed-Solomon encoded TADIL-J messages.Any simulator that is not emulating JTIDS network data load throughput shall have the ability to configure the maximum number of JTIDS words transmitted per second, but shall not exceed the JTIDS maximum of 1536 words per second. (Packed 4 Single Pulse timeslot *128 timeslots per second). This upper limit shall not apply to JTIDS LET (Enhanced Throughput) packets. If the packing mode from the JTIDS header and the number of messages contained in the Signal message do not agree, (i.e. the header states that the packing mode is P2DP and there are 12 JTIDS words contained with the message) extra messages may be dropped by the receiving simulator—as would happen in a live JTIDS datalink. If there are fewer messages in the data area than prescribed by the packing mode, the receiver shall treat the missing messages as J31.7 “No statement” messages and parse the message stream accordingly.Perceived data shall be able to be sent on a configurable port separate from all other DIS data. This allows datalinks to be selectively routed without additional hardware. This also allows for gateways to forward data between legacy DIS datalink formats and the new standardized format Timeslots shall not be “pre-sent”. Systems shall wait until the timeslot occurs to transmit data in order to receive the latest update to data.  Receiving systems shall buffer messages after the timeslot has occurred to account for network latency. The amount of time to buffer messages for a timeslot shall be a runtime configuration item. The amount of time entered shall be the same for all participants in the same network and will cause the simulations to all “retire” a particular timeslot at the same time. This effect is not important for lower levels of fidelity (TSA modes 0,1) but is critical for all fidelity levels that tie a message to a particular timeslot along with an NDL. If the effects of messages arriving later than the timeslot are not important (multiple JUs transmitting in the same timeslot, contention access, data arriving while the receiving JU is transmitting), or the physical network infrastructure has low latency, the buffer time can be set to a low number or to zero.All systems set at fidelity level two or higher shall have their system times synchronized to a common time reference. Any error in the clock synchronization times must be added to the network latency  before retiring a timeslot.All systems should have some representation of a terminal clock time. If high fidelity synchronization is to be accomplished, the system shall model a terminal clock (and its associated drift).If multiple messages are received with identical MSEC, TSEC, Net Number and Time slot number, receivers shall discard all messages except from the closest transmitting entity (in the simulation space).There are three operator selectable communication modes for a real JTIDS/MIDS network, modes 1,2, and 4. The selected communication mode determines whether or not the network can operate on multiple nets (by employing frequency hopping) and the transmitted data are encrypted. All JUs in a JTIDS/MIDS network must operate in the same communication mode.In JTIDS DIS simulation, the normal operation mode is mode 1.  Frequency hopping and MSEC/TSEC is simulated appropriate to the specified level of fidelity.When operating with JTIDS communications mode 2, there will be no frequency hopping, but MSEC/TSEC shall still be used, depending on the level of fidelity. The explicit frequency of 969 MHZ shall be set in the transmission message frequency field and the bandwidth will be 3MHZ. The net number in the signal message shall be zero for all transmissions (no multi-netting).  Mode 4 eliminates communications security in addition to the features of communications mode.  The MSEC and TSEC fields shall be set to 0 when in communications mode 4 in addition to specifying the explicit transmit frequency as in communications mode 2.Table  Table 5.1.1: JTIDS Communication ModesTable Timeslots shall be numbered sequentially, such that timeslot 0 represents timeslot A-1, timeslot 98303 represents C-32767. When the epoch is 112, the last valid timeslot is 45151 (end of the day)Generated machine receipts shall use timeslots as assigned in the network description. There is no special consideration given to machine receipts, they are treated as any other TADL-J fixed format message.Relay can be accomplished by transmitting relay information in assigned timeslots. There is no special mechanism necessary to simulate relay transmissions.Levels of FidelityThis protocol allows simulations to achieve different levels of fidelity by assigning one of five Timeslot Allocation (TSA) levels. The level of fidelity can be set as a run time option for a simulator.  The TSA level is set in Modulation Parameter #1 of the transmission packet with an enumeration of 0-4 as described below.  Table Table Table 5.1.2: JTIDS Levels of FidelityTSA LevelFidelitySynchronization FidelityIssuesRecommended Usage0LowLowDoes not emulate JTIDS network characteristics.

The NPG and net fields are filled in the signal message, but all other data in the JTIDS transmission header is set to the default value. Multiple messages are permitted in a single signal message.  All messages within the signal message are assumed to be for the same NPG & Net with the same assumed packing.  There is no TSA or metering with up to the maximum number of messages (as specified in the DIS standard) packed into data area of a single signal message. Low fidelity synchronization is achieved in accordance with paragraph 5.1.4.1 of this protocol.  TSA Level 1, Low FidelityTSA Level is similar to TSA Level 0 except that there is minimal metered data: one timeslot worth of information in one signal message. As in TSA level 0, the NPG and Net fields are filled in, and the rest of the transmission information is set to default.  Low fidelity synchronization is achieved in accordance with paragraph 5.1.4.1.TSA Level 2, Medium fidelityTSA Level 2 allows for metered data with no encryption.  When TSA level is set to 2, messages shall be assigned to individual timeslots.   The NPG, Net, and Timeslot identification  fieldsidentification fields are filled in. The TSEC and MSEC are set to default.  Low fidelity synchronization is achieved in accordance with paragraph 5.1.4.1.TSA Level 3, Medium FidelityThis level enables full TSA to include Encryption.  When TSA mode is set to 3, stacked nets, multinets, and crypto nets can be emulated.  All transmission information fields are filled in.  Low fidelity synchronization is achieved in accordance with paragraph 5.1.4.1.TSA Level 4, High FidelityIf the TSA mode is set to 4, everything from TSA 3 is emulated, with the addition of the high fidelity synchronization procedures in paragraph 5.1.4.2.   All JTIDS header fields in the signal message shall be filled with non-default meaningful values. Communication between JUs with different fidelity levelsIn the event that that participants in a simulated JTIDS network cannot set their respective simulations to operate at a common level of fidelity (i.e. TSA Level) the following procedures apply: If a low fidelity network participant is in a simulated JTIDS network with a higher fidelity NTR, it shall follow the low fidelity synchronization procedures in paragraph 5.1.4.1 skipping the RTT synchronization process, changing directly to the fine synchronization state once it receives a J0.0 initial net entry message from the NTR or any IEJU.  If a higher fidelity network participant is in a simulated JTIDS network with a lower fidelity NTR, it shall either follow the low fidelity synchronization procedures in paragraph 5.1.4.1 or it shall achieve fine sync with other high fidelity simulators. This can be accomplished by exchanging RTT-Bs or by passively synchronizing with other available high fidelity simulators.  If no other high fidelity simulators are available to synchronize with, the high fidelity participant shall skip the RTT exchange, and directly entering fine synchronization once the J0.0 is received.If the NTR is a lower fidelity simulation and unable to simulate full NTR duties, the NTR must still have the ability to transmit net entry messages. The signal message shall be filled in with a J0.0 with zeroed timeslot information. RTT emulation will not be required of low fidelity NTRsA lower fidelity JU entering the net shall use the network synchronization ID received from the NTR/IEJU in its transmission information PDUs.  It will then issue PPLIs at the assigned rate. This is nominally of once every 12 seconds (equivalent to the A-0-6 time slot block), though this can occur at times of up to 24 seconds. All simulators, regardless of fidelity shall accept another terminal’s statement of synchronization capability if the network synchronization ID matches its own network synchronization ID. In a lower fidelity synchronization simulation, non-reception of a PPLI message pair for 60 seconds shall indicate that the unit has fallen out of the datalink. Synchronization procedures must be re-accomplished--reception of a PPLI message stating fine synchronization must occur before data from the JU will be accepted.Time SynchronizationOne station shall be designated as the Network Time Reference (NTR).  Network Synchronization IDs shall be uniquely generated by NTRs.  NTRs shall use a random function to generate a 32 bit unsigned integer, using the DIS timestamp of the time they begin to simulate a NTR as the random key seed.If a system in the real world is capable of acting as NTR, any corresponding simulator shall also be capable, at a minimum, of acting as a low fidelity NTR. If no simulators in a simulated JTIDS net are capable of acting as a NTR, participants shall be able to set the network synchronization ID to zero and transmit the synchronization state of fine synchronization. A zero in the network synchronization ID field shall be accepted as a wildcard matching any network synchronizationIf a network synchronization ID accompanying received data does not match a JUs own network synchronization ID, the data will be considered as having not been received. Simulated terminals shall accept net entry messages (J0.0) from any simulated transmitting terminal within reception range. When high fidelity synchronization is applicable (TSA Mode level 4), and the net entry message has a network synchronization ID different than the local network synchronization ID, the JU shall revert back to coarse synchronization, use the new network synchronization ID, cease sending TADIL-J data and will attempt re-synchronization with the new network in accordance with the JTIDS terminal specification. If the network synchronization ID (i.e. during changeover of NTR or multiple IEJUs) is the same as the locally held key, the JU will not revert to coarse synchronization status and will not stop transmitting TADIL-J data.If an initial net entry message is received from a unit that does not have a Transmitting Terminal Primary Mode of IEJU or NTR, it shall still be accepted. Depending upon implementation, the simulation operator may be notified so that the sending simulator can correct this error condition.Using time and position quality from high fidelity synchronization procedures, geodetic position quality and Relnav modes will be able to be emulated in applicable terminal emulators.All simulators shall have at least a low fidelity simulation of a terminal clock, potentially independent of the simulator’s (or live equipment’s) clock. Since whatever time an NTR has set is considered correct, an NTR may transmit a time that significantly varies from the actual simulated wall clock. In high fidelity simulators the terminal clock may model the clock drift of an actual JTIDS terminal. It is not expected that terminal clocks will be modeled at a high level of fidelity and the actual level of emulation is left to the implementer. Low Fidelity Synchronization Low fidelity synchronization is applicable to simulation systems interested primarily in providing tactical datalink information as part of an operational scenario.  The low fidelity synchronization procedure allows such systems to exchange Link-16 messages without being encumbered by actual JTIDS transmission and message security requirements.  The NTR shall begin by issuing Net Entry message pairs at a rate in accordance with the JTIDS terminal specification (Typically in timeslot A-0-6 at a rate of every 12 seconds). A unique randomly generated key shall be filled into the network synchronization ID field. The primary JTIDS duty field shall contain a NTR enumeration.The receiving JTIDS Unit Terminal (JU) then updates its own terminal time by taking the terminal perceived time, and adding the amount of time for the message to traverse the distance between the two entities. It also shall fill it’s own network synchronization ID in the with the network synchronization ID received from the NTR. This ID shall be used in all transmission information issued by the JU in the JU’s own network synchronization ID field as long as the JU remains in synchronization with the same NTR.Modulation Parameter 4 (Synchronization State) in the transmission information will be set to “2” after reception of the J0.0 Initial Net Entry message from the IEJU or NTR, corresponding to “fine synchronization”.The first data message that will be sent by a JU entering the network shall be the JUs PPLI along with the accompanying Transmitter PDU. High Fidelity Synchronization High Fidelity Synchronization corresponds to only the high fidelity TSA level 4.  It is applicable to those systems for which accurate emulation of the RF JTIDS network is paramount, potentially in high fidelity training, network testing and network experimentation. The high fidelity synchronization procedure follows steps 1 and 2 of the low fidelity synchronization procedure above.  At this point, the JU is considered to have achieved “coarse synchronization”.  The JU then transmits the appropriate RTT message (A or B). The synchronization state is set to 1 for “coarse synchronization”. The JU will use it’s own terminal perceived time in the perceived transmit time field. The appropriate NTR/JU will answer (in accordance with the JTIDS terminal specification), using the JU perceived time and the entity distance to calculate the perceived receive time. The RTT is then transmitted. The transmitting JU shall fill its own terminal perceived time perceived transmit time field. The JU shall then update its own terminal time with the received round trip time, which is calculated from the received perceived transmit time. After the appropriate number or RTT exchanges have occurred (depending whether the RTT-A or RTT-B method of synchronization was used and the internal terminal simulation model), the JU shall consider itself to be in fine synchronization and shall continually issue RTT message pairs to maintain synchronization at rates specified within the JTIDS terminal specification.   Once the terminal emulator model has met the requirements for fine synchronization, normal message transmissions in accordance with the net data load can occur. All transmissions shall then set the Synchronization State to “2” for “fine synchronization”.All machines that are to accomplish high fidelity synchronization shall have their system times synchronized in order to allow for a consistent time “base” for all the machines to reference. The accuracy of the synchronization mechanism shall have an error less than the simulated time of propagation.  It should be noted that synchronization errors on the order of the simulated propagation time completely mask the Link-16 timing effects that are being emulated.  Moreover, accounting for these errors is impossible since the actual value of the error cannot be determined.The first data message that will be sent by a JU entering the network shall be the JUs PPLI (J2.x) message.   in theup toup toaround as follows  EMBED Equation.3  The tdelay is computed by:  EMBED Equation.3  WhereRTtimestamp is the actual time held by the receiving/replying participant (Derived from NTP, GPS, etc)RT terminal is the value of the simulated Link 16 terminal clock at the receiving/replying participantTTtimestamp is the actual time held of transmitting participant (Derived from NTP, GPS, etc)tdelay is the difference between the receiver’s real-time clock at the time of receipt and the sender’s real-time clock at the time of transmission (i.e. it approximates the emulation network latency), andtpropagate is the propagation time of the radio frequency message in the simulated environment.This formula computes the perceived time of receipt by the receiving simulator with respect to the simulated terminal clock of the sender.The originating JU shall then update its own terminal time in accordance with the simulator model and the Link 16 fine synchronization procedures.  After the appropriate number or RTT exchanges have occurred (depending whether the RTT-A or RTT-B method of synchronization was used and the internal terminal simulation model), the JU shall consider itself to be in fine synchronization and shall continually issue RTT message pairs to maintain synchronization at rates specified within the JTIDS terminal specification.

For the DIS Protocol Profiles, transmission and receipt of PDUs, and general service requirements, refer to the IEEE Std. 1278.1a --1998.  General RequirementsIf the packing mode from the JTIDS header and the number of messages contained in the Signal PDU do not agree, (i.e. the header states that the packing mode is P2DP and there are 12 JTIDS words contained with the message) extra messages may be dropped by the receiving simulator—as would happen in a live JTIDS datalink. If there are fewer messages in the data area than prescribed by the packing mode, the receiver shall treat the missing messages as J31.7 “No statement” messages and parse the message stream accordingly.Simulators in compliance with this standard shall at a minimum have the capability to identify the NPG and Net number of transmitted data to allow them to operate at TSA mode level 0 and 1.A Transmitter PDU shall be issued:When entering the simulated JTIDS network, after reception of the J0.0, in accordance with the rules specified in section 5.4.2.2.7.4With any Signal PDU containing any J0.x (network maintenance) message.With any Signal PDU containing any unit’s own PPLI message (this does not apply to indirect PPLIs)A Transmitter PDU shall be issued upon transition to Radio Silence or upon exiting the JTIDS network.Each Signal PDU shall contain data for one Net participant, for one NPG, for one Net Number.  Thus, each Signal PDU shall only contain data of one message type identifier.Transmitter PDU DescriptionTable 5.1.1 shows the format for the Transmitter PDU for JTIDS simulation.Transmitter PDUs used in Link-16 simulation shall include all of the standard information, as well as the information described in the modulation fields.  The Transmitter PDU shall contain the following fields.Frequency.  This field shall specify the JTIDS center frequency of 1131000000 for communications mode 1.  For communications mode 2 or 4, then a frequency of 969000000 shall be used.Transmit Frequency Bandwidth.  This field shall contain the bandwidth of the JTIDS signal, simulating the use of the entire frequency band as an average over time.  The field shall be represented by a 32-bit float value of 240000000, unless operating in communications mode 2 or 4, and then a value of 1 shall be used.Modulation Type.

Setting the enumeration to 1 shall indicate that the entity is the NTR.  Setting it to 2 shall indicate that the entity is a JU participant.Modulation Parameter 3 shall contain the transmitting terminal’s secondary mode, with the following enumerations: 0=None, 1=Net Position Reference, 2=Primary Navigation Controller, 3=Secondary Navigation Controller.Modulation Parameter 4 shall contain the synchronization state.  For TSA mode level 0-3 this shall be set to 2 for “fine synchronization”.  For Fidelity level 4, it is initially set to 1 for “coarse” synchronization and the procedures in section 5.4.1.2 for high-fidelity synchronization are followed.Modulation Parameter 5 shall contain the Network Synchronization ID.  For TSA modes 0-2, it shall be set to default.  For TSA modes 3-4, it shall be a 32-bit random integer generated by using the DIS timestamp as the seed. Only an NTR can generate a Network Synchronization ID; all other participants shall use the ID obtained from the NTR to which they are synchronized.Table 5.1.1: Transmitter PDU for TADIL - JTable Table -–Field Size (bits)Transmitter PDU FieldsDescription96PDU HeaderProtocol Version8 bit enumeration Exercise ID8 bit unsigned integer PDU Type8 bit enumeration Protocol Family8 bit enumeration Timestamp32 bit unsigned integer Length16 bit unsigned integer Padding16 bits unused 48Entity IDSite16 bit unsigned integer Application16 bit unsigned integer Entity16 bit unsigned integer 16Radio ID 16 bit unsigned integerShall contain the ID of the radio transmitting the signal.64Radio Entity TypeEntity Kind8 bit enumeration Domain8 bit enumeration Country 16 bit enumeration Category8 bit enumeration Nomenclature Version8 bit enumeration Nomenclature16 bit enumeration 8Transmit State 8 bit enumeration 8Input Source 8 bit enumeration 16Padding 16 bits unused 192Antenna LocationX component64 bit floating point Y component64 bit floating point Z component64 bit floating point 96Relative Antenna Locationx component32 bit floating point y component32 bit floating point z component32 bit floating point 16Antenna Pattern Type 16 bit enumeration 16Antenna Pattern Length 16 bit unsigned integer 64Frequency 64 bit unsigned integer64 Bit Int: 1131000000 (center frequency) Or unless operating in Communications mode 2 or 4, then 96900000032Transmit Frequency Bandwidth 32 bit floating point32 Bit Float: 240000000 unless in Communications mode 2 or 4, then 300000032Power 32 bit floating point 64Modulation TypeSpread Spectrum16 bit Boolean array1: Frequency HoppingMajor 16 bit enumerationNew Modulation—7: Carrier Phase Shift Modulation (CPSM)Detail16 bit enumerationSystem16 bit enumerationInteger Enumeration: 7 = JTIDS/MIDS16Crypto System 16 bit enumeration16Crypto Key ID 16 bit unsigned integer8Length of Modulation Parameters 8 bit unsigned integer 24Padding 24 bits unused 8Modulation Parameter #1Time Slot Allocation Mode8 bit enumerationInteger enumeration 0-48Modulation Parameter #2Transmitting Terminal Primary Mode 8 bit enumerationInteger Enumeration: 1-NTR 2-JTIDS Unit Participant8Modulation Parameter #3Transmitting Terminal Secondary Mode 8 bit enumerationInteger Enumeration: 0=None 1-Net Position Reference 2-Primary Navigation Controller 3-Secondary Navigation Controller8Modulation Parameter #4Synchronization State8 bit enumerationInteger Enumeration: 1=Coarse Synchronization2=Fine Synchronization32Modulation Parameter #5Network Synchronization ID 32 bit unsigned integer32 bit random number, use the DIS timestamp as the seedSignal PDU DescriptionTable 5.2.2 below shows the format for the Signal PDU.

For TSA level 0-1, this field is set to zero. This field is a 32-bit unsigned integer, and shall contain timeslot information for timeslot and epoch number in accordance with MIL Std. 6016B.

It is therefore almost certain that the HLA implementation of the Link-16 protocol will form part of a larger Federation Object Model (FOM). The HLA implementation of Link 16 is therefore defined as a Base Object Model (BOM), as described in BOM Study Group Final Report: (SISOREF0052001). A BOM is defined as "a single aspect of simulation interplay that can be used as a building block" within a FOM.The Link-16 BOM is described in the Object Model Template (OMT) in the XML based IEEE 1516 OMT format At the time of writing this standard many federations still use the older HLA 1.3 standards, so the Link-16 BOM is also described in OMT 1.3 format.  The complete OMT tables may be found at the SISO web site.The Link-16 BOMThe Link-16 BOM is intended to describe how to implement a simulation of the Link-16 Tactical Data Link (TDL) and its associated message set, TADIL-J, within a High Level Architecture (HLA) simulation. The Link-16 BOM is intended to be integrated within the Federation Object Model (FOM) of the HLA federation.The Link-16 BOM assumes that the parent FOM has the following properties: contains all current DIS Transmitter PDU parameters as part of object class hierarchy contains all current DIS Signal PDU parameters as part of interaction class hierarchyConventions within the Link-16 BOM in OMT 1.3 format follow those adopted by the RPR FOM. Many of these conventions are intended to address some of the shortcomings of the OMT 1.3 format (these have been address in the IEEE 1516.2 specification). These include: All names have the initial letter of each word capitalized (except when the word follows an abbreviation which is itself capitalized) All enumeration names end in the text "Enum" followed by a number. The number indicates the number of bits in the enumerated valueAll complex data type names end in the text "Struct"Protocol Implementation Details The HLA protocol implementation details are directly equivalent to the corresponding details for DIS.  References to the modulation parameters of the Transmitter PDU are modified to refer to the fields of the attribute of the JTIDSTransmitterStruct complex data type (see section 2.8). References to other fields of the Transmitter PDU are modified to refer to fields of the assumed parent object class that is equivalent to the Transmitter PDU (see assumption 1). References to the data fields of the Signal PDU are modified to refer to parameter of the TDLBinaryRadioSignal interaction (or its subclasses). References to other fields of the Signal.PDU are modified to refer to the parameters of the assumed parent Radio Signal interaction (see assumption 2 above).Levels of Fidelity This section defines the levels of fidelity for Link16 BOM compliant federates. The HLA levels of fidelity are directly equivalent to the corresponding DIS levels of fidelity as defined in section 5.1.2.References to the modulation parameters of the Transmitter PDU are modified to refer to the fields of the attribute of the JTIDSTransmitterStruct complex data type (see section  REF _Ref20503604 \r \h 5.5.1 ). References to the Signal PDU are modified to refer to the parameters of the TDLBinaryRadioSignal interaction (or its subclasses).Time Synchronization (HLA)This section defines how Link16 BOM compliant federates achieve the required (simulated) Link16 time synchronization. The HLA time synchronization mechanism is directly equivalent to the corresponding mechanism for DIS as defined in section TBD.References to the Transmitter PDU are modified to refer to the fields of the attribute of the JTIDSTransmitterStruct complex data type (see section  REF _Ref20503604 \r \h 5.5.1 ). References to the Signal PDU are modified to refer to the parameters of the TDLBinaryRadioSignal interaction (or its subclasses).Protocol Implementation Details (HLA)This section defines how Link16 BOM compliant federates are to implement the Link16 protocol. The HLA protocol implementation details are directly equivalent to the corresponding details for DIS as defined in section TBD.References to the modulation parameters of the Transmitter PDU are modified to refer to the fields of the attribute of the JTIDSTransmitterStruct complex data type (see section 5.2). References to other fields of the Transmitter PDU are modified to refer to fields of the assumed parent object class that is equivalent to the Transmitter PDU (see assumption a). References to the data fields of the Signal PDU are modified to refer to parameter of the TDLBinaryRadioSignal interaction (or its subclasses). References to other fields of the Signal PDU are modified to refer to the parameters of the assumed parent Radio Signal interaction (see assumption b).Object Class DataThe Link16 BOM defines no new object classes. Instead the BOM defines a single complex data type (JTIDSTransmitterStruct) that corresponds to the modulation parameters in the DIS Transmitter PDU defined in section 5.2.2. An attribute of this complex data type should be added to the object class in the parent FOM corresponding to the DIS Transmitter PDU - see assumption a).Interaction Class DataThe Link-16 BOM adds a family of interactions. In order to support future TDL implementation of other data links the parent interaction is generic - the TDLBinaryRadioSignal interaction. This interaction contains no parameters (and is neither publishable nor subscribable). The intention is that the TDLBinaryRadioSignal interaction becomes a subclass of the parent FOM's equivalent of the DIS signal PDU - see assumptions b).The Link16RadioSignal interaction, a subclass of the TDLBinaryRadioSignal interaction, contains the JTIDS network header as described in section 5.2.3. Subclasses of this interaction define the different types of Link-16 messages.BOM ImplementationThe BOM implementation, in OTM 1.3 format, is described in annex B.Adding the Link-16 BOM to the RPR FOMA field of type TDLBinaryRadioSignal is added to the SpreadSpectrumStruct complex data type. Is cardinality is 0-1.The TDLBinaryRadioSignal interaction is added as a subclass of a new interaction, the TDLRadioSignal interaction, which itself is a subclass of the RPR FOM's RadioSignal interaction. The additional TDLRadioSignal interaction is necessary due to a limitation of the RPR FOM implementation of the DIS Signal PDU. Section TBD defines that the DIS Signal PDU used for all Link-16 messages is a Raw Binary Signal PDU. The RPR FOM equivalent of this PDU type (the RawBinaryRadioSignal interaction) contains a parameter, called SignalData, containing one or more octets containing the signal data. Using this interaction directly would mean that the structure of the actual Link16 message would be lost. An alternative implementation where the Link16 interaction becomes a subclass of the RawBinaryRadioSignal interaction means that the Signal Data is not used - this could cause difficulties for DIS to HLA gateways, although the interaction contains the required message structure.The proposed solution also means that DIS to HLA gateways need to be modified, but the modifications are well defined (DIS Raw Binary Signal PDUs need to be teed into either a RawBinaryRadioSignal interaction or a TDLBinaryRadioSignal interaction dependant on the TDL type. Conversely the gateway must merge both interaction types into a single DIS Signal PDU). This paper will not address this requirement further as it is a separate issue. The exchange of network data will not be addressed in this paper, as it is not core to the discussion.PAGE  The views, opinions, or findings contained in this document are those of the author(s) and should not be construed as an official Government position, policy, or decision, unless so designated by other official documentation. PAGE 1Copyright (c) 2003 SISO Inc.
