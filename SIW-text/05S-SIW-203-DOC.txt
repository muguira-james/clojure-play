Name of Forum or Group: IO-ISRChairLou FordVice ChairDavid AcevedoSecretaryDon StonerObjectives for this Workshop:1.	Consider/review IO-ISR objectives and strategies in the GIG2.	Discuss the future path for the IO-ISR Forum3.	Comments and Recommendations:1.	We averaged 25.3 people in a room with a capacity of 20.  At only one of our six presentations was the room at less than capacity, and that one was at 19.  We need a larger room for the Fall SIW.2.	We had a good open forum discussion concerning the future of the IO-ISR following the conclusion of the last presentation.  Thoughts about standards for IO in constructive simulations were considered, and some traffic through the SISO reflectors along these lines has already begun.3.	Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)25.3Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)28Peak attendance (including joint sessions)28Total papers presented6“No-show” presentations0Other presentations and panel discussions1Recommended Reading List nominations (including previous nominations):1.	2.	3.	2005 SPRING SIW OUTBRIEF FORM
