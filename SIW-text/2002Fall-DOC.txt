This transformational approach to military operations leverages extreme information connectivity, advanced sensors, and powerful computational capability to give entire forces, down to the lowest levels, near-perfect ability to see through the fog of war, act swiftly and confidently, and win decisively. Network centric warfare presents unique challenges, as well as great opportunities, to the modeling and simulation community.  The numerous sensors and unmanned vehicles need to be modeled in a correct and consistent manner.  Advanced, highly automated, command and control systems need to be modeled in the early development stages, and then directly integrated into simulation federations for operational testing and for exercises once the new systems are fielded.  The new C4ISR systems will also need to embed training simulations into their on board computers, and be able to use simulations as decision aids and rehearsal environments.  Finally, many of the technical challenges addressed by distributed simulation over the past decade are resurfacing as network connectivity, capacity and management problems for the proposed network centric forces.  Come join us as SISO explores this exiting new area, and see what SISO has to offer in meeting these challenges.M&S PROGRAM BRIEFINGSTo facilitate communication among SISO members and sponsors, we also invite briefings regarding M&S-related programs under development or in procurement, such as the USAF Distributed Mission Training (DMT), Distributed Mission Operations (DMO), and Joint Synthetic Battlespace (JSB) programs, the US Army`s Joint Virtual Battlespace (JVB) program, and the US Navy`s Naval Aviation Simulation Master Plan (NASMP). INDIVIDUAL FORUM AND GROUP CALLS FOR PAPERSGenerally, papers and presentations are considered in three main categories:  *  User Community Forums, which examine and promote topics of interest related to the use and adequacy of available simulation capabilities and new capabilities needed byM&S users.  *  Specialty Area Forums, which examine and promote current and emerging simulation processes and technology.  *  Virtual Forums, Study Groups, Product Development Groups, and  Special Sessions, which deal with topics that merit timely solicitation of feedback from the SISO community.Short synopses of the individual Forum and group Calls for Papers are provided below.  Additional details are provided in the web version of the CFP located at http://www.sisostds.org/siw/02Spring/index.htm.USER COMMUNITY FORUMSAnalysis (ANL)ANL focuses on interoperability issues and uses of distributed models and simulations by the analysis community, including issues of experiment design and data analysis, analysis issues in ADS and SBA, requirements definition.

Authors are encouraged to address either of two SENS product focus areas: ``Accreditation discriminators for sensor simulation applications`` and ``Sensor domain specific sources of noise, error, and bias.``Simulated Natural Environment (SNE)SNE addresses multi-domain use and reuse of digital representations and models of the natural environment, including land, oceanic, atmospheric, and space data.  SNE also focuses on standards for, and application of, SNE data, effects and data models for M&S; interoperability issues and lessons learned in large-scale federation events that include multiple real-time and non-real-time SNE representations; and issues and use cases relating to SEDRIS, environmental data classification systems, and coordinate transformation systems.  Two special focus areas for this SIW are multi-resolution environments and environmental tailoring.Verification, Validation & Accreditation (VV&A)VV&A focuses on methodologies, procedures, and associated techniques used to establish credibility of federations.  VV&A objectives emphasize quality (e.g., building in authoritative representations and behaviors) and risk management, and support development and evolution of VV&A guidance that supplements federation development/application lifecycle process model documentation. Special focus: conceptual model validation and substantive interoperability.Vehicle/Weapon System Modeling (VWS)VWS focuses on lessons learned in development of vehicle or weapon system simulations (including Computer Generated Forces (CGF) and Semi-Automated Forces (SAF) simulations) and Simulation Based Acquisition (SBA) of actual vehicle and weapon systems (DD 21, Joint Strike Fighter,  Future Combat System, etc.)VIRTUAL FORUMSAdvanced Distributed Learning and Distributed Mission Training (ADL/DMT)The ADL/DMT Virtual Forum is aimed at issues of ADL and DMT as it applies to the M&S Community, including the Shareable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) and the education, training, and performance support needs and requirements of users and implementers of ADL and DMT technologies.   Development and implementation of standards allowing interfaces and interoperability between educational/training systems and modeling and simulation environment using HLA, DIS, or other simulation interoperability tools.Federation Performance (FedPerf)FedPerf addresses the efficiency and effectiveness of Federation performance, including metrics for characterizing the performance of individual federates, composite federations, and RTIs in various applications, as well as tools and techniques for predicting and optimizing performance.Grand Challenges (GC)This Virtual Forum is aimed at identifying overarching topics of broad interest to the M&S community.  Grand Challenges are defined as achievable M&S improvements that fulfill a critical need and that require significant and sustained development efforts from diverse groups in order to succeed.  GC seeks position papers from international defense agencies, commercial industry, the medical community, the transportation industry, and law enforcement organizations, among others, to identify complex and multi-faceted activities that require collaborative efforts spanning multiple domains to achieve a needed, critical solution or solutions in one or more application domains. As in all SIW work, the focus is on interoperability standards.

By design, the TRM will facilitate analysis of requirements, architecture, design, implementation, and testing of heterogeneous systems.  In addition, the TRM will support improved dialogue among users, developers, and technicians in the C4ISR community.Discrete-Event Systems Specification Study Group (DEVS SG)The DEVS (Discrete Event System Specification) SG is exploring possible standards for supporting discrete event simulation.  DEVS is an increasingly accepted  framework for understanding and supporting the activities of modeling and simulation, based on generic dynamic systems concepts.  It is a mathematical formalism with well defined concepts of coupling of components, hierarchical, modular construction, support for discrete event approximation of continuous systems, and an object-oriented substrate supporting repository reuse.Tactical Data Link Modeling Study Group (TDL SG)The TDL SG is creating a reference product for simulation of tactical data links within the current DIS framework, with an eye towards implementation in HLA. The SG arose from the multiple incompatible methods for exchange of TADIL-J/Link-16 data and the lack of ability to simulate the JTIDS/Link-16 RF network. The study group will recommend methods for the exchange of TADIL-J/Link-16 data as well as methods to simulate the JTIDS/Link-16 RF network. The last task for the study group will be to recommend additional tactical datalinks for review.PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT GROUPSProduct Development Groups (PDGs) are approved to generate a specific SISO Product (Standards, Guides, and Reference Products) after approval of a formal Product Nomination.
