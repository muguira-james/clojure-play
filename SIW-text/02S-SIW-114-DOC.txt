Recent aerospace operations demonstrate that a structured ISR process is a considerable force multiplier.  Synchronize and integrated national, theater, and tactical assets into one collection strategy are paramount to optimize ISR operations.   PBA provides decision quality information, and gives a commander a predictive view of the AOR.  Knowledge of the operational environment achieved through PBA enables the COMAFFOR/JFACC to exploit emerging opportunities while mitigating the impact of unexpected adversary actions.  Additional information concerning this emerging concept can be found on the PBA Web page maintained by ACC/IN:  https://in.acc.af.mil/pba/pba.htm EMBED PowerPoint.Slide.8  Predictive Battlespace Awareness (PBA) FrameworkDynamic ISR Concept of Operations, Employment, and Proposed Force Structure.  PBA applies across the spectrum of operations and will dramatically improve the AOC’s ability to identify, collect, and analyze relevant information to support the operational kill chain (Find, Fix, Track, Target, Clear, Engage, and Assess [F2T2CEA] methodology).  The ability to achieve and sustain PBA is a considerable force multiplier heavily dependent on the ISR Division within the AOC.  a. PBA consists of four key elements:   Target System Analysis:  Critical to achieving PBA is the integration of a wide breadth factors regarding the physical and virtual systems that support adversary behavior and course of action (COA).  PBA begins by examining the adversary as a total system across military, political, and economic domains as well as collaboration among intelligence analysts and target analysts in preparation for target development, validation, nomination, and prioritization.  Intelligence Preparation of the Battlespace:  IPB is a rigorous analytical methodology that defines the battlespace environment, describes the battlespace’s effects, evaluates the adversary, and determines adversary Courses of Action (COA).  TSA and IPB are the foundation for optimal ISR strategy and planning.  ISR Strategy and Planning:  ISR Strategy and Planning yields an ISR strategy and integrated plan that weighs availability of joint ISR assets, platform and sensor capabilities and limitations, adversary threats to ISR assets, and dissemination. These elements determine the best way to employ ISR forces. ISR Employment:  Dynamic execution of the current day’s ISR operations; depends on a robust operational architecture capable of rapidly adjusting ISR assets in real time to counter new threat and emerging targets.  Analysis/Assessment.  PBA process improvements will assist the AF with conducting decisive, precise, and successful operations on a global scale.  As such, AF intelligence must provide commanders at all levels predictive, actionable intelligence based on timely, pertinent, and accurate information to support decision making and the operational-level kill chain (FIND, FIX, TRACK, TARGET, CLEAR, ENGAGE, and ASSESS).  Critical Capabilities TableCapabilityValueMeasureTrigger Event / Requirements to DemonstrateConduct analysis to refine threat location and movement projections (FIND)Capability to find and fix mobile and re-locatable targets w/in 30 minutes. Compare predictive analysis w/“actual” adversary employment and dispositionsTCT event(s)Provide continuous IPB development and adversary COA refinement using real time sensor data. Seamless transition from IPB to current intelligence.

Interoperability, commonality, and connectivity improve and unify ISR capabilities and enhance planning and mission execution.  Interoperability capitalizes on the investment made by other Services and joint activities in ISR capabilities fostering integration.Training. The primary, long-term objective of an intelligence staff training plan tailored for PBA is to train, qualify, and certify component-level intelligence and associated staff personnel on critical wartime and peacetime tasks.  The plan will address individual personnel responsibility, items trained during the training cycle, training methods, documentation procedures, performance evaluation and testing, and trend analysis procedures. PBA Concept Summary.Recent aerospace operations demonstrate that a structured ISR process that synchronizes national, theater, and tactical assets into one ISR strategy and optimizes ISR capabilities is a considerable force multiplier.  PBA results from combining TSA, IPB, ISR Strategy and Planning, and ISR Employment into a coherent framework that maximizes the capabilities of ISR assets across the spectrum of operations and in all environments. The integration of these traditionally separate components provides commanders the capability to quickly shift ISR assets to target those events predictive analysis allows us to anticipate.  This detailed level of understanding of the battlespace will minimize the time from target detection to attack, particularly against Time Sensitive Targets (TST).  PBA ultimately allows the commander to select the optimum means to achieve desired effects, seize and maintain the initiative and, most importantly, continuously evaluate generated effects, conditions, and courses of action, allowing for the selection of the optimum friendly Course of Action (COA).  PBA is also the basis for future architectures to integrate advanced air and space-based platforms capable of machine-level interaction and performing surveillance, reconnaissance, and command and control functions to precisely locate critical targets and significantly improve AF global engagement capabilities.  PAGE  6
