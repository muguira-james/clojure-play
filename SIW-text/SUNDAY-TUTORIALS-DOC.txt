TUTORIALS					 SUNDAY AFTERNOONIEEE 1516 – THE FUTURE OF 		  SANIBEL ROOMHLA/INSIGHTS INTO FEDERATION		       1300-1700DEVELOPMENT ISSUES						Part A - IEEE 1516 - THE FUTURE OF HLAInstructors: 	Bob Lutz - Johns Hopkins Univ. Applied Physics LabReed Little - Carnegie Mellon Univ. Software Engineering InstThis tutorial provides insights into the IEEE 1516 version of the HLA and makes the case as to why organizations should move to this version vs. the HLA Version 1.3. The tutorial starts with an overview of the HLA background and definition and then provides a summary of the HLA IEEE 1516 development process and highlights the improvements provided by the 1516 version. Next a business case as to why a program should use IEEE 1516 instead of HLA 1.3 is presented. The tutorial then ends with a discussion of what needs to be done to transition to IEEE 1516. This tutorial is aimed at people who need to make an informed decision with respect to which version of the HLA they should use. Some prior familiarity with HLA version 1.3 is assumed.1500-1530	BREAKPart B - INSIGHTS INTO FEDERATION DEVELOPMENT ISSUESInstructor: 	 Jake Borah - AEgis Technologies GroupThis tutorial addresses distributed HLA federation development issues. Distributed simulation environments grow increasingly complex in modeling fidelity, scale, and diversity relative to the types of simulations, computing platforms, and networked locations. Distributed simulation environments consist of several components that must be configured and tested prior to a successful federation execution. This tutorial will discuss how a network and its components, the Run-Time Infrastructure software, and simulation applications influence HLA federations. The Federation Development and Execution Process model will be presented as a sound system engineering approach for creating a distributed HLA simulation environment. Finally, the tutorial will highlight tools that can be used to document, troubleshoot, and enhance the performance of an HLA federation.TUTORIALS					 SUNDAY AFTERNOONM&S IN THE GIG ENVIRONMENT	  AMELIA ROOMAPPLYING THE COMMAND AND                       1300-1700CONTROL INFORMATION EXCHANGEDATA MODEL (C2IEDM) FOR M&S 					Part A - ENABLING NETWORK CENTRIC OPERATIONS WITH SIMULATIONS Instructor:    Per Gustavsson - Ericsson Microwave Systems AB 		The US Department of Defense (DoD), NATO and Partnership for Peace (PfP) countries are currently launching itself into Global Information Grid (GIG) environments. Regardless of how the GIG finally emerges, we know that it will be based on a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). In this tutorial some of the commonalities and differences between the various efforts made in the GIG area is presented. The GIG comprises domains that are used to group and categorize the services. Within the different initiatives work on standards, service stacks, and service definitions are conducted within the different initiatives that will provide the core upon which we build M&S services in the future. We will describe how using these services will change the way we look at M&S standards; how existing and emerging data models provide a critical part of the solution; that simulation is entailing the network cenric operations across nations; and where we are going with the HLA. In particular, we will exploit web services, as they are currently the choice for implementing SOA. Topics included are from the viewpoint of the US and Swedish GIG such as, the web service stack; standards being adopted by the GIG and their implication for service providers; ontologies, taxonomies and data models play in web services; what standard data models are being used; how M&S needs to look at standards in the light of GIG services; and how this affects the review of the IEEE 1516 HLA standard. 1500-1530     BREAKPart B - THE COMMAND AND CONTROL INFORMATION EXCHANGE DATA  MODEL (C2IEDM) IN NET-CENTRIC ENVIRONMENTS Instructors:  	Dr. Andreas Tolk - Old Dominion University/VMASC Chuck Turnista – Old Dominion University/VMASC Data modeling experts from 24 nations developed the "Command and Control Information Exchange Data Model (C2IEDM)" capturing the mutual consensus of these nations on what operationally relevant data should be exchanged on the battlefield.  Alternatives names are "Generic Hub" or "Battlefield Generic Hub."  This data model also became the data model of the Multilateral Interoperability Program (MIP).  The concept is approaching a new quality, as various projects and concepts are starting to adapt the ideas. The project is moving towards the Joint Consultation, Command and Control Information Exchange Data Model (JC3IEDM), which will  support XML among other improvements. The tutorial introduces the main ideas of Model Based Data Engineering using C2IEDM as the reference data model, shows how data was aligned using C2IEDM in various projects conducted with the support of the team members. It will in particular focus on C2IEDM based web services, C2IEDM for Namespace management, and generally C2IEDM in the domain of net-centric and net-enabled applications.TUTORIALS					 SUNDAY AFTERNOONACHIEVING COMPOSABILITY              BISCAYNE ROOMWITH BASE OBJECT MODELS				1300-1700	(BOMs)	                 									      Instructors:  Larry Root - SimVentions  Paul Gustavson - SimVentions, BOMPDG Drafting Group Lead EditorModeling and Simulation (M&S) has proven to be an effective tool for training the writher and for planning and preparing against emerging threats within the global community. A key enabler that has contributed to this effectiveness has been the availability of models, tools, and other resources such as terrain, network assets, and scenario missions. And, as long as you remain within the environment and domain of your applied M&S framework (i.e., HLA, DIS, OOS), relative flexibility is achievable. The difficulty, however, is in being able to leverage models across the environments, domains, and M&S frameworks to define and support scenarios and the executable environments representative of Joint training exercises.Models are almost exclusively defined for a particular simulation application. Fortunately, a standard-based approach, termed Base Object Models (BOMs), for describing and sharing models across environments, domains, and M&S frameworks has emerged from a simulation-community-wide grass-roots effort. Essentially, BOMs can be used to represent the approaches and scenario elements that are necessary to fulfill specific military tasks such as resupplying friendly forces or identifying and disarming combatants. Thus, it is well suited for supporting Joint training efforts.This example-focused tutorial will largely center on building and using BOMs for supporting composability. Participants will be encouraged to bring their laptops, as this tutorial will walk through the BOM development effort, and show how the Real-Time Platform Reference (RPR) BOMs and other supporting BOMs can be integrated and used to fulfill a specific training exercise. Additionally, we will look at the language neutral interface provided by the BOM and various implementation aspects that can be supported to enable federates.TUTORIALS					 SUNDAY AFTERNOONRANGE SYSTEM		                                  LARGO ROOMINTEROPERABILITY 						1300-1700USING TENA AND THETENA MIDDLEWARE 				      Instructor:  Ed Powell - SAICThe TENA Software Development Activity (SDA) is chartered to enable interoperability among ranges, facilities, and simulations in a timely and cost-efficient manner and to foster reuse of range assets and future software systems. To achieve this vision, the TENA SDA has developed and is validating a common architecture called the Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA), which provides for real-time software system interoperability using the TENA Middleware, as well as interfaces to existing range assets, C4ISR systems, and simulations. The current version of the TENA Middleware, Release 5.1, has been released to the range community for testing, evaluation, and feedback; has been used in the JNTC JRF-05 exercise; and is planned for use in the Army DTE-05 event and other exercises. This tutorial is intended to provide the attendee with a short overview of the TENA architecture as well as more detailed look at the TENA Middleware, its features and uses, and the direction TENA is going in the future.
