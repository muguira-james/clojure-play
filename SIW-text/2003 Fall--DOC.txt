Effective interoperability of Space and  Space-system simulations is of considerable interest in many M&S application domains (military, aerospace, communications, astronomy and cosmology, etc.).  Consequently, this is a serious concern to the world's defense establishments, civil aerospace authorities, and associated industrial sectors.  Plenary speakers, papers, and workshops will address approaches to standardsand interoperability for this diverse and burgeoning simulation application constituency.M&S PROGRAM BRIEFINGSTo facilitate communication among SISO members and sponsors, we also invite briefings regarding M&S-related programs under development or in procurement, such as the USAF Distributed Mission Training (DMT), Distributed Mission Operations (DMO), and Joint Synthetic Battlespace (JSB) programs, the US Army's Joint Virtual Battlespace (JVB) program, and the US Navy's Naval Aviation Simulation Master Plan (NASMP). SISO NEW INITIATIVE AREA:   MEDICAL SIMULATIONMedical simulation systems require interoperability standards that build upon already extensive interface standards for application in areas such as   * operational systems for robot assisted surgery  * command & control systems for medical situational awareness  * medical models of varying resolutions for research and development  * training systems for instruction and rehearsal  * imaging systems for treatment planning and assessment  * logistic planning systems for security and disaster responseSISO plans to continue the track established at the Spring SIW for this important area.INDIVIDUAL FORUM AND GROUP CALLS FOR PAPERSGenerally, papers and presentations are considered in three maincategories:  *  User Community Forums, which examine and promote topics of     interest related to the use and adequacy of available     simulation capabilities and new capabilities needed by     M&S users.  *  Specialty Area Forums, which examine and promote current and     emerging simulation processes and technology.  *  Study Groups, Product Development Groups, and Special Sessions,     which deal with topics that merit timely solicitation of     feedback from the SISO community.Preliminary versions of the individual Forum and Group Calls for Papers are provided below.  Please also refer to the web version of the CFP posted at http://www.sisostds.org/siw/03Fall/index.htm.  This version will include additional information based on the results of discussions conducted at the Spring SIW (April 2003) and, later, the Euro-SIW (June 2003).USER COMMUNITY FORUMS Analysis (ANL)ANL focuses on interoperability issues and uses of distributed models and simulations by the analysis community, including issues of experiment design and data analysis, analysis issues in ADS and SBA,requirements definition.  Special focus:  use cases that include both success and failure.Research, Development, and Engineering (RDE)RDE addresses issues and applications of distributed M&S within the RDE domain, including requirements for backward compatibility between simulations and distributed simulation infrastructures.  RDE focuses on community requirements and experiences with new applications using distributed computing technologies.  RDE specifically solicits papers that advance the "state of the art" and/or take a position, however controversial.  Authors targeting papers to the RDE Forum must include, as the final slide in their presentations, a summary of the paper's key findings or concepts and identifying issues for the RDE Community. System Acquisition and Product Development (SAPD)SAPD focuses on M&S as part of a transformed, integrated enterprise responsible for the entire system/product life cycle, as well as the interoperability of systems of systems. Subjects include policy and process approaches, establishment of business cases for M&S and solutions to intellectual property issues, and the value of standards, information sharing, reuse, collaboration, and work forceperspectives. SAPD is particularly interested in papers on actual experiences from both industry and government in applying M&S to the above, approaches to key issues, and lessons learned.Test and Evaluation (TE)TE addresses uses of distributed simulation in test and evaluation (T&E), including the integration of live entities with virtual and constructive simulations; the integration of hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL), [*** what does ISTF stand for ???? ***] (ISTFs), and other T&E facilities with distributed simulations; the use of simulation to test and evaluate C4ISR, Systems of Systems (SoS), Federations of Systems (FoS), and interoperability; and performance issues in using distributed simulation in T&E applications.Training (TRAIN)The TRAIN forum focuses on issues associated with using simulations to support the acquisition of knowledge, skills, behaviors, and attitudes through education, training, and performance support.  Wesolicit papers addressing simulation-based learning in industry,academia, and government (including the DOD), particularly thoseidentifying interoperability or standards shortfalls or requirements.Special interest topics: (1) simulation support of all aspects ofAdvanced Distributed Learning (ADL) and Distributed Mission Training(DMT) Programs: education, training, and performance support (e.g.embedded training, automated performance assessment, missionrehearsal, Course of Action analysis, etc.); (2) simulation supportto training events associated with Small Scale Contingencies (SSCs),Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT), Support and StabilityOperations (SASO), and other related combat and non-combat activitiesand (3) Multi-Resolution Modeling as it applies to M&S.SPECIALTY AREA FORUMS   Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I)C4I addresses standards to ensure interoperability when couplingsimulation systems and C4I systems, standards to ensure composabilitywhen integrating simulation components and C4I components into acommon framework, and standards to represent C4I systems and theunderlying infrastructure within simulation applications.  C4I islooking for papers dealing with architecture and data/object modelalignment, common frameworks, applicability of C4I standards and openstandards, and lessons learned from applying these standards.  Inparticular, C4I is interested in the development of enhancedoperational functionality based on M&S, and especially on increasingthe efficiency and abilities of the Warfighter by introducingsimulation capabilities within operational systems.   Communication, Frameworks, and Infrastructure (CFI)CFI focuses on technologies that support interoperation and run-timeexecution of distributed simulations.  Historical examples includethe HLA Run-Time Infrastructure (RTI), DIS, ALSP, and SPEEDES.  TheForum will also consider new and alternate infrastructure concepts,such as web-based technologies.  Topics include performance data,implementation and design details, usage strategies, networkingtechniques, fault tolerance, security considerations, and middleware orother frameworks for constructing, utilizing, or extending simulationinfrastructure.  NOTE:  The CFI forum replaces and incorporates theformer RTI&C forum.   Distributed Simulation Development Process (PROC)PROC focuses on developing a generalized system engineeringprocess for constructing and executing distributed simulations(e.g., FEDEP for HLA federations). This includes "lessonslearned" solutions from creating real-world, useful M&Sapplications, including problems of integration, scalability,reuse, robustness, and the effectiveness of HLA.   Exercise Management and Feedback (EMF)EMF focuses on tools and standards for automating various aspects ofdistributed simulation exercise planning and execution, includingscenario development, initialization, monitoring, runtime controls, datacollection and repositories, visualization, and after-action review.   Information Operations - Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance   (IO-ISR)IO-ISR seeks papers that deal with all aspects of InformationOperations (IO), including computer network attack and defense,modeling of IO in exercise and training, and threats to the Internetand other communications infrastructures.  IO-ISR seeks papersaddressing Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) issuesincluding representation of the different intelligence disciplines(e.g., SIGINT, IMINT, HUMINT, etc.) and the associated Tasking,Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (TPED) systems andprocesses associated with the delivery of intelligence products tothe warfighter.  In addition, we are interested in activities relatedto modeling IO-ISR, including Effects-Based Operations, NetworkCentric Warfare, Predictive Battlespace Awareness and crisis response.   Logistics and Enterprise Models (LOG)LOG focuses on simulations and simulation challenges associated withmodeling supply chains, logistics management processes, logisticspolicies and business practices, as well as the portrayal oflogistics in military simulations at all levels.  Topics of interestinclude innovative approaches to supporting network centric operations,rapid deployment forces, Operations Other Than War (OOTW), globalcommercial operations, and enterprise process simulations.  The latterinclude but are not limited to executable models of work flow,manufacturing, distribution, transportation and customer, patient,crowd, or traffic flow.   Sensor Modeling and Simulation (SENS)SENS is an interdisciplinary forum that bridges the environmental andmission/system-related areas, including simulation of sensor effects,issues pertaining to the stimulation and simulation of sensor systems,incorporation of sensor system simulations into other simulations, andenvironmental effects on sensor systems.  Authors are encouraged toaddress SENS focus areas: accreditation discriminators for sensor simulationapplications; sensor domain specific sources of noise, error, and bias;and sensor data fusion.   Simulated Natural Environment (SNE)SNE addresses multi-domain use and reuse of digital representations andmodels of the natural environment, including land, oceanic, atmospheric, andspace data.  SNE also focuses on standards for, and application of, SNEdata, effects and data models for M&S; interoperability issues and lessonslearned in large-scale integrated simulations that include multiplereal-time and non-real-time SNE representations; and issues and use casesrelating to SEDRIS, environmental data classification systems, andcoordinate transformation systems.   Verification, Validation & Accreditation (VV&A)VV&A focuses on methodologies, procedures, and associated techniques used toestablish credibility of models, simulations, and federations.  VV&A goalsemphasize quality (e.g., building in authoritative representations andbehaviors) and risk management, and support development and evolution ofVV&A guidance to enhance the federation lifecycle process.  Currentobjectives include establishing clear and unambiguous scales to categorizeV&V evidence  (e.g., levels of V&V) and formalizing the conceptual model viathe Conceptual Model Study Group.  Special focus areas include levels ofV&V, conceptual model validation, and substantive interoperability.   Vehicle/Weapon System Modeling (VWS)VWS focuses on lessons learned in development of vehicle or weaponsystem simulations (including Computer Generated Forces (CGF) andSemi-Automated Forces (SAF) simulations) and Simulation BasedAcquisition (SBA) of actual vehicle and weapon systems (DD 21, JointStrike Fighter, Future Combat System, etc.).   STUDY GROUPSStudy Groups (SGs) are chartered when SISO wants to obtain recommendationson well-defined issues from groups of volunteer experts selected fromappropriate Forums.  Study Group sessions at this Workshop include   C4ISR/Simulation Interoperability Technical Reference Model SG   (C4I TRM SG)The C4I TRM SG is creating a technical model that can be used as astandard frame of reference for interoperability between C4ISR Systemsand M&S Systems.  By design, the TRM will facilitate analysis ofrequirements, architecture, design, implementation, and testing ofheterogeneous systems.  In addition, the TRM will support improveddialogue among users, developers, and technicians in the C4ISR community.    Navy Aviation Simulation Master Plan SG  (NASMP SG)The Naval Air Systems Command, in support of OPNAV N789, developed theNavy Aviation Simulation Master Plan (NASMP) to launch future NavyDistributed Mission Training (DMT) programs and to improve current NavyDMT programs.  NASMP is developing an Interoperability Standard to beused by commercial vendors and organizations involved in the developmentof simulators, simulator infrastructure, and related enabling technologies.    Simulation Conceptual Modeling SGThis SG is conducting an investigation regarding simulation conceptualmodeling, with the intent to establish proposals for recommendedpractices.    Simulation Reference Markup Language (SRML) SGThis SG is investigating the potential for standardizing a SimulationReference Markup Language (SRML) and a universal simulator within theSISO community.  SRML is an XML schema that adds simulation behaviorto any XML document, and has been identified by the Base Object Model(BOM) group as enabling "encapsulated BOMs".   PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT GROUPSProduct Development Groups (PDGs) are approved to generate a specific SISOProduct (Standards, Guides, and Reference Products) after approval of aformal Product Nomination.  Current Product Development Groups include   Real-time Platform Reference FOM (RPR FOM PDG)Version 1.0 of this Reference Federation Object Model was the first SISOstandard, capturing the functionality of IEEE 1278.1-1995.  RPR FOM 2.0,currently under development, will add the functionality of IEEE 1278.1a-1998.   Environment Data Coding Specification (EDCS PDG)EDCS is a component of the Synthetic Environment Data RepresentationInterchange Specification (SEDRIS) that provides a data dictionaryand coding standard for environmental data used in simulations ofterrain, atmosphere, ocean, and space.   Spatial Reference Model (SRM PDG)SRM is another key component of SEDRIS, with a well-organized anddocumented framework that encompasses the primary spatial referenceframes in use in the DoD today, a set of extremely accurate andefficient algorithms for coordinate conversions and transformations,and a standard portable implementation of  those algorithms.   Link-16 Simulation Standards (Link-16 PDG)Link 16 is one of the critical components of interoperability in theAllied forces.  There are immediate and overdue operationalrequirements for existing and future military simulations to exchangeLink-16 data using a single interoperable standard. This group isdeveloping a SISO standard to define the methods to simulate a Link-16Network within Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) and HighLevel Architecture (HLA) frameworks.   Dynamic Link Compatible HLA API PDG (HLA API PDG)The Dynamic Link Compatible HLA API Product Development Group (PDG) willbe developing a standard to define the requirements for Dynamic LinkCompatible HLA APIs and methods for testing compliance.  This standardwill be very useful to the distributed simulation community that usesthe HLA and  particularly useful to simulation developers that have toparticipate in multiple Federations using different RTIs.   Use of theDynamic Link Compatible HLA APIs will also support Federation managersin assembling Federates.   The PDG plans to define standard C++ and JavaAPIs for HLA 1.3 which will be based on the current APIs.  Additionally,alternative C++ and Java APIs will be created for the IEEE 1516.1 HLA.The 1516.1 APIs will be a SISO-extension to the IEEE standard.   Base Object Model PDG (BOM PDG)The BOM PDG is developing a specification for Base Object Models.The open standardization of BOMs is essential for establishingcomponent technology to facilitate interoperability, reusabilityand composability.  As part of this standardization effort, thePDG will define an XML schema to identify the base elements andontology of a BOM and provide guidance describing how BOMs canbe used to generate FOMs and SOMs from BOM compositions.    PROPOSED PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT GROUPSSeveral new Product Development Groups (PDGs) are planning meetings forthe upcoming Workshop to discuss Product Nominations.  These include  * Discrete-Event Systems Specification Product Development Group  * Base Object Models  * Dynamic Link Compatible RTI APISubscribe to the SAC-COM and SAC-DISCUSS reflectors to keep up withthe status of these groups.
