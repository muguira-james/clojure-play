Currently, this DMO process does not discuss LSC (Levels of Standards Compliance). Thus making it difficult to determine how well MTCs can interoperate together without unnecessary upgrades. In this effort, we define notional LSC level 1 and how it might apply to interoperability between the AWACS, F-15C and KC-135 mission training center (MTC) simulators. Using a notional IFF state condition for an F-15C distributed training simulator, we discuss a minimum LSC level necessary for determining if intra-team MTC federates can join the inter-team DMO federation and thereby participate in training exercises. We conclude that there is a one-to-one relationship between increases in LSC level and granularity and resolution as they relate to simulation fidelity of cultural (human-made roads, buildings, etc.) and weather effects, and the ability to transmit, detect and identify RF emissions and determine situation awareness. Finally, we generated a notional decision-making process for negotiating whether a new air vehicle simulator can join an existing federation, and, if it is permitted to join, for how long its contract can last with the federation.1. INTRODUCTIONDuring the summer of 2003, Distributed Mission Training (DMT) was renamed Distributed Mission Operations (DMO). What is DMO and what is its purpose? DMO can be described as an ongoing program designed to collectively train geographically dispersed pilots, whom are using different air vehicle simulators at different locations. Collectively training pilots and aircrew members creates situations conducive for contextual instruction, knowledge transfer, traditional and cognitive apprenticing and simulation training practiced against somewhat realistic environments. As a result of experiencing these environments, air combatants are able to gain experience through learning more about how to interoperate their air vehicles within representative, multi-service, multi-ally, multi-mission, high pulse density, high threat, high friendly and high ownship radio frequency emissions environments under simulated combat conditions. Further, DMO allows them to accomplish such training at cost lower than those for live simulations of such settings. More succinctly, Daum & Aldinger state “The purpose of the Distributed Mission Training (DMT) Program is to allow United States Air Force (USAF) warfighters to train in the full spectrum of team combat skills”  ADDIN ENRfu [1]. Using DMO simulation training as a means for preparation to fight within the full spectrum of the development of team combat skills infers varying levels of standards compliance concerning clarity of threat, identification friend or foe, ability to see, hear, sense, and experience whatever is expected to be experienced in addition to having the ability to react toward whatever the combatants are expected to react upon. Further, as stated above, combat readiness will result from having clarity of understanding as a result of practice and rehearsal, contextual instruction, knowledge transfer and traditional and cognitive apprenticeship. How practice and rehearsal are accomplished is obvious. What is less obvious and less specifically discussed is the importance of contextual instruction, knowledge transfer and traditional and cognitive apprenticeship through the use of realistically simulated scenarios. Contextual instruction through DMO simulation can be described as situations where trainees learn to apply their knowledge toward becoming effective air combatants, leaders, strategists and thinkers. Put another way, DMO contextual learning translates acquired knowledge to the performance of tasks. DMO is able to provide a contextual learning environment through the following: training focusing on air combat issues; integration of academics with real-life experiences; personalization of instruction; visualization of abstract ideas; demonstration of utility; provision of factual knowledge on a "need-to-know basis"; removal of the knowledge-intimidation factor (presenting the information in knowledge bits or modules often removes the knowledge-intimidation factor)  ADDIN ENRfu [2].1.1 DISTRIBUTED MISSION OPERATIONS: KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER For DMO, we define knowledge transfer as the dissemination of what has been learned over a period of time by seasoned air combat veterans and shared with less seasoned combatants in a way that the learning becomes inculcated into the lesser experienced combatant’s semantic memory. Such a transfer might be implemented through DMO during scenarios requiring all exercise participants to perform as a team. In scenario situations where they fail to perform as a team, someone or many can be virtually killed. Virtual death can be considered representative of what would happen if they were experiencing real combat. However, it is equally likely, from a virtual perspective, for lesser-experienced air combatant participants to make mistakes even when knowledge has been shared. The idea behind DMO is for knowledge acquisition, transfer and utilization to occur based on the contextual instruction concepts incorporated into training simulation scenario and syllabi.DMO air combatants experience traditional apprenticeship in three ways: modeling, scaffolding and fading  ADDIN ENRfu [2]. They experience cognitive apprenticeship, in the same way that they experience traditional apprenticeship, by training to perform specific tasks  ADDIN ENRfu [2]. Through DMO they learn abstract ideas and concepts, because the ideas and concepts are made visible to trainees as they begin to understand the utility of the concept and ways to apply it toward air combat  ADDIN ENRfu [2].DMO simultaneously provides learning activities, for pilots and aircrew members, leading to their cognitive development process of acquiring skill or knowledge concerning combat readiness. It also simultaneously provides training activities leading to their attaining the skilled behavior necessary for air combatants. DMO uses tele-immersion design philosophy to make said activities possible. DMO creates the illusion that air combatants at dispersed geographical are together in the same place at the same time. Its technology is such that the same images are seen at the same time by all of those combatants whom have the appropriate emulated sensor technology in their virtual cockpit. Thus allowing them to communicate about the threat, target, et cetera, and what they propose to do regarding such.1.2 DISTRIBUTED MISSION OPERATIONS: COMBAT READINESSDMO’s distributed, integrative, simulation capability helps trainees to obtain combat readiness that can be experienced as a result of knowledge transfer, apprenticeship, and simulated contextual instruction using synthetic environments, but it also happens as a result of tele-immersion stimulation of some combination of the five senses of touch, sight, hearing, smelling, and tasting during training exercises. Moreover, the air combatants experience simulated scenarios that make them experience “flight or fight”, teamwork, socialization, language variations and accents, emotions, love, camaraderie, fear, selflessness, selfishness and so forth. In this paper, we discuss the four systems that, we think, makeup DMO. Those four are the air vehicle simulator(s), the DMO network (and its DOC and NOC and artificial intelligence and neural networks), the stimulators (that invoke or induce activity between machines and combatants), and the human combatants (and their languages, cognitive, social, affective, psychomotor, learning, knowledge transfer, and five senses domains). We examined how the four systems are integrated as one and what decision-making process DMO’s DOC and NOC might need to make for a “new” or “peripheral” air vehicle (MTC) simulator to “permanently” or “briefly” join the federation and thereby participate in some aspect of the training exercise. Each “new” and “peripheral” must negotiate time for being a member of the federation whether that membership is “permanent” or “brief”. According to Tracy’s (1995) Behavioral Science article, “Negotiation: An Emergent Process of Living Systems” such a negotiation must occur according to  “(1) a template…or a charter—that provides basic programming for the system’s structures and processes, (2) a set of values—purposes or goals—that serves as a basis for making purposeful choices, (3) a decider subsystem that utilizes these values to make choices and provide additional instructions, thereby allowing the system to adapt to its environment, and (4) a reproducer subsystem that creates the template for a new system and mobilizes the matter and energy required to build it”. Once negotiation occurs, between two MTC air vehicle simulators, the DMO, DOC and NOC, at some point a decision is rendered based upon what was negotiated. Either the requesting MTC air vehicle can join the federation or not. It can remain a member of the federation throughout the exercise or not.Also included in this paper is our effort to understand, from a general perspective, how a decision-making process applies to air vehicle MTC simulator providing simulated and synthetic environment information according to perceptual fidelity, resolution and granularity. In the next section, we describe DMO’s history and functionality. Figure 1.0: DMO Evolution  ADDIN ENRfu [1].1.3 LEVELS OF STANDARDS COMPLIANCE (LSC)Levels of Standards Compliance (LSC) is defined as the DMO O&I IPT’s effort to develop a basic level standard and guideline for determining how a federate simulator can join a federation of simulators. Put another way, “LSC takes a performance-based standard and makes a scale of capabilities within that standard”  ADDIN ENRfu [4]. The LSC concept is necessary for cases ranging from the low- to high-level training. Low-level training will be necessary between the F-15C or F-16 aircraft and the KC-135. (See refueling Figures 1.1 and 1.3.) High-level training is necessary for trainees at the individual, four-ship, intra- and inter-team (F-15C and F-16) levels. However, at the inter-team level, especially, each virtual cockpit (Figure 1.2) must have the capability to interoperate with other simulators: locally, nationally and internationally. Although beyond the scope of this paper, we argue that there is also a relationship between LSC, Bloom’s taxonomy, contextual instruction, knowledge transfer, traditional and cognitive apprenticing and simulation training, resolution and granularity for the trainees as well as simulators.Bloom's taxonomy of learning illustrates three characteristics of learning that can be attributed to pilot and aircrew member trainees. Those are cognitive (knowledge), affective (attitude), and psychomotor (skills) characteristics. MTC simulators are designed to help pilot and aircrew trainees master all three skill sets. Along with helping trainees master skill sets according to Bloom’s taxonomy, the simulators help them to learn abstract concepts through their ability to provide contextual instruction.DMO’s brief/debrief capability in addition to training exercises provide contextual instruction to trainees according to “methods and strategies that match their own [added by authors] natural ordering and perceiving abilities” [2]. USAF researchers understand that “Learning new facts and concepts does not necessarily guarantee actualization of that new knowledge. Students must learn to apply their knowledge to be effective thinkers. Contextual learning translates acquired knowledge to the performance of tasks” [2].Knowledge transfer can be a factor for DMO equipment and trainees alike. One can speculate that prospective neural-like networks and AI-like capabilities might become a part of the DMO program effort. That DMO and its integrated MTCs might have the capability and adaptability to learn from new scenarios and new and old trainees and the techniques implemented and learned by those students just like the trainees can learn from the MTC simulations. Stated another way, the trainees will learn from the DMO’s MTC simulation scenarios in addition to the collaborative environment with other new and seasoned trainees and the simulators might have some capability to learn from its pupils too. Using DMO, the trainees can therefore receive knowledge transfer, traditional and cognitive apprenticing and simulation training all at the same time. However, some aspects for inculcating new learning will be based on the quality of fidelity, resolution and granularity and their relationship with simulation interoperability.		Figure 1.1: F-15s being refueled by KC-135.

Continuous simulation interoperability is a must for DMO training to be possible from a, twenty-four hour, seven day per week perspective. The federation and its operational timeframe must allow pre-existing and prospective simulators (or mission training centers (MTCs)) to function together whether they are performing in the intra- and inter-operate mode. As we advance in the areas of DMO, MTC, LSC, simulation interoperability concepts, it is inevitable that knowledge base, rules, axioms and the like must be included in prospective training system upgrade developments. 1.5 KNOWLEDGE BASEKnowledge base is the content of a particular domain or field of information. For both combatants and MTC simulator trainees, the content standards, necessitate new teaching methods. The new content standards involve combatant learners employing and displaying specific knowledge of skills. The teaching for the machine is two-fold: (1) The MTC simulator must learn how to be adaptive and anticipate new ways to provide information content when vignettes are changed. (2) It should have some form of artificial intelligence that allows it to think and react and defend in the same manner as would a biological entity; instead of engineers revising code, architecture and so forth it must be able to reconfigure and redistribute routes or pathways according to new types of message content protocols and/or bit error rate or encryption or communication or microscopic electronic countermeasures. Other areas for consideration are granularity of time and space and image; resolution; fidelity; noises; security; semantic and episodic memory; recognition of patterns and symbols; transfer of knowledge; communication; neural network; language; cognitive, affective, social and psychomotor domains. Moreover, higher-level thinking and problem-solving skills will be required. Presently integrated circuits (ICs) and computer technologies used for simulators have limited ability to reason. People have the ability to reason, adjust and modify what they do. Most software programs, architectures and protocols have no understanding of the world and no ability to change according to new difficulties. For example, consider an open-ended situation such as combat; which is unpredictable. 2.0 SCENARIO: MISSION TRAINING CENTER (MTC)For years, TSPG has been involved in the development of training devices for MTCs that perform using intra- and inter-operational methods. MTCs are multiple pilot training systems designed to perform the same functions that representative air vehicles perform during missions. Most MTCs have multiple virtual cockpit simulators designed to imitate air vehicle characteristics regarding communications, combat scenarios, fire control solutions and weapon firing and detonation processes, in addition to providing tactical formation and operations information. Further, these training cockpits provide synthetic natural environments of different types of terrain, weather and cultural effects. Furthermore, they are designed to link geographically separated air vehicle simulators that are networked together at the same MTC site so that pilots can perform intra-team training together.As part of the DMO effort, over recent years, MTCs are now also designed to link geographically separated air vehicle simulators that are networked together at worldwide MTC sites so that pilots can perform inter-team training together. Moreover, prior to DMO development, MTCs were mostly designed for the same type or brand of air vehicle simulator, with limited level of difficulty concerning the communication or exchanging of information. DMO development, itself, represents the networking, transmission and reception and communication and exchanging of data or information being emanated from or received by dissimilar air vehicle simulators using unrelated technology, architectures and protocols; its requirement includes an attempt to do little or no modification to existing simulators.Consequently, the challenge for the DMO O&I IPT is that they must consider cost and contractual challenges along with simulation interoperability technological issues and impacts unrelated MTC virtual cockpits: to develop a standardized way for dissimilar simulators to communicate and exchange information such that pilots and aircrews can obtain good training. Likewise, they must consider the low- and high-level pilot training and simulation interoperability, fidelity and LSC schema or criteria necessary for low-level support air vehicle MTC simulation trainers to join the federation.To contain cost and apply larger percentages of funding toward MTCs representing training for shooters, we ascribe that there is a one-to-one correspondence between low-level simulation fidelity, granularity, resolution, avionics communications and limited necessary training time. For example, a limited amount of communication and training time is necessary for F-15C or F-16 MTC pilots to train with KC-135, refueling, MTC pilots. Whereas, if we consider Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS), E-3, another shooter supporting air vehicle, high-level fidelity, granularity, resolution, avionics communications and unlimited training are necessary. The E-3 Sentry is an airborne warning and control system (AWACS) aircraft that provides all-weather surveillance, command, control and communications needed by commanders of U.S. and NATO air defense forces. 2.1 RF EmissionsUsing simulation, RF emissions relates to having the ability to transmit, detect and identify RF emissions. Emissions information might include point of origin, power, frequency, direction, scan pattern, and other parameters of electronic or acoustic emissions. Such parametric data are used to stimulate simulated sensors capable of detecting and responding to said data. With electronic warfare (EW) simulations, parameters are dynamic and change often. Some EW simulations require that emission packets be transmitted at the same rate as entity packets.Bit packets representing voice communications, images and so forth are transmitted from simulator-to-simulator. Bit packets are used in simulations that include voice and radio systems. Using notional simulation of RF emissions data related to an IFF interrogation-transponder replicated system we looked at an example of what constitute minimal LSC criterion for MTC IFF simulation interoperability and inter-communication among KC-135, F-16 and F-15 air vehicle simulators. We examine interoperability and inter-communication among simulators by discussing a notional DMO MTC communication activity between the IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) PDU emissions from F-16 to KC-135. The analysis is compatible with the training and simulation scenarios discussed in the previous sections with AWACS, F-16, F-15C and KC-135 MTC nodes.  With this type of initial sample scenario, interoperability solutions are developed by implementing IFF procedures between, for example, the F-16 and KC-135 for determining if the KC-135 will have an active node and be a “friendly participant” within the node-to-node DMO simulation infrastructure. Traditionally, the four major modes of IFF operation currently in use by military aircraft (plus one submode) are as follows: Mode 1 is a nonsecure low cost method used by ships to track aircraft and other ships. Mode 2 is used by aircraft to make carrier controlled approaches to ships during inclement weather. Mode 3 is the standard system also used by commercial aircraft to relay their position to ground controllers throughout the world for air traffic control (ATC). Mode 4 is secure encrypted IFF (the only true method of determining friend or foe) Mode "C" is the altitude encoder.  For this application, approaches for simulating Mode 4 will be considered in more detail since this mode is encrypted.   Figures 2.0 and 2.1 are graphical depictions of Mode 4 for a notional operational environment.  Interactive data structures for simulation concerning the Mode 4 type IFF scenario can be developed by considering Protocol Data Unit (PDU’s) in DIS environment.   A PDU is a data message with a defined format and semantic, which enables the data message to be exchanged on a network between different simulation applications. A PDU provides information concerning simulated entity states and the simulation environment. The entity information exchanged between simulation applications includes the type of entity, its location, its orientation, and how the entity might appear to others. The simulation entity could be an aircraft, a vehicle, a building, a munition (such as a missile), a soldier, or a cloud of smoke. The visual appearance of an entity can be expressed in a number of ways. For example, entities may be on fire or smoking, or an entity may emit engine smoke or have a wake trailing behind in the water, all of which affect the visual appearance of the entity. Mode 4 Interrogation Is Transmitted And ReceivedInterrogated Aircraft Responds With Proper Crypto-Encoded Pulse Train   Figure 2.0:  Mode 4  –  Case1.Mode 4 Interrogation Is TransmittedInterrogated Aircraft Does Not Respond Or Responds With Improper Crypto-Encoded Pulse TrainFigure 2.1:  Mode 4  –  Case2.There are different families of PDU’s depending on the application.  Examples protocol families include Entity Information/Interaction, Warfare, Logistics, Simulation Management, Distribution Emission Regeneration, and Radio Communications. Within each family are a number of different types of PDUs. For example, in the Warfare protocol family, there is the Fire PDU that communicates the firing of a weapon. There is also a Detonation PDU, which communicates the detonation or impact of munitions (this describes in detail when and where a detonation took place, and the blast effect, etc.). In the Logistics protocol family there is a Service Request PDU, and a Resupply Complete PDU, among many other types of PDU’s. In the future, additional PDUs and protocol families will be added to these standards to enhance simulation functionality and interaction.  Figure 2.2 depicts the PDU data structure in a graphical matrix format:Figure 2.2:  PDU Data Structure  ADDIN ENRfu [7].For example, possible 8-bit enumerations for the Protocol-Version field could be as follows:           1     2     3     4     5     6DIS_PDU_version_1.0 IEEE_1278-1993 DIS_PDU_version_2.00_-_third_draft DIS_PDU_version_2.00_-_fourth_draft IEEE_1278.1-1995 IEEE_1278.1A-1998 For this IFF interoperability application, the 8-bit enumeration for the PDU-Type field can be designatated by “28” for IFF/ATC/NAVAIDS and the 8-bit enumeration for the Protocol Family can be designated by “4” for Radio Communication. One approach to developing a computer simulation model for an encrypted PDU word of a given “Length”, as specified in the PDU table of Figure 2.1, is as follows:Develop a Digital Encryption Scheme for Digital PDU Word Develop Model of Bit-Error-Rate (BER) for Digital PDU Word based on Environmental ConditionsApply BER Model to “Corrupt” Original Encrypted Digital PDU Word.  This “Corrupted Word” is intended to serve as a simulation model for a real transmitted word that is transmitted across an RF channel in an operational scenario Figure 2.3 illustrates a digital data encryption scheme known as “Diffie-Hellman” that can be used as a notional model for modeling more elaborate IFF encryption schemes.Figure 2.3:  Graphical Depiction of Original Diffie-Hellman Model for Digital Data Encryption  ADDIN ENRfu [7].With this approach (as described in the bullets above) the MTC simulator representing each air vehicle generates a digitally encrypted IFF code word and then applies an “Environmental BER Model” to simulate the effects of the transmission channel.    The “Environmental BER Model” is derived through performance of a link-budget analysis of an IFF communication channel of interest.  For example, Figure 2.4 shows a sample plot of BER versus Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).   In order to develop the BER model of interest, SNR values can be tabulated for various weather conditions as well as other adverse conditions that may have measurable effects on IFF communication.  The resulting SNR values can be mapped to Bit-Error-Rates, where the resulting Bit-Error-Rates can in-turn be applied within the MTC exchange to generate “corrupted IFF words” that are representative of a given transmission channel.Figure 2.4:  Sample Bit-Error-Rate Versus Signal-to-Noise Ratio Curve  ADDIN ENRfu [7].The IFF example is an illustration of how one might classify LSC based on a hierarchy of processes and functions necessary for one simulator to communicate with another from the most rudimentary to complex level. At LSC 1, the lowest level, for IFF, five language development activities must occur just like that with humans. Those five basic processes are the building of vocabulary (protocol), decoding communication (unwrapping of PDU), understanding syntax, identifying semantics, identifying context (matching of enumerations database). With complex IFF system exchanges those processes along with other information would also be involved in the information exchange. Hence for higher LSC more advanced IFF, communications and other emulations and the like are necessary in addition to higher levels of intra- and interoperability, fidelity, resolution and granularity. Nonetheless, what are these attributes?Intra-operability is the ability for an MTC to perform four-ship training, simulation and exchange and use of information from within by a small homogeneous network as expected when applied at each site. Interoperability is the ability of a model or simulation to provide services to and accept services from other models and simulations, and to use the services so exchanged to enable them to operate effectively together. Put another way, interoperability is the ability of MTCs to exchange and use information (usually in a large heterogeneous network made up of several local area networks).DMSO defines fidelity to be the accuracy of the representation when compared to the real world. High fidelity for an MTC training simulator means the visual image seems similar to what pilots and aircrew members would see in the actual cockpit. Further, because of greater image generation capability, trainees can see images resembling cultural features, weather effects, terrain and synthetic natural environments resembling real environments constructed by humans, clouds or snow or rain, deserts or savannas or jungles, and terrain surfaces and computer generated forces and so forth with variable resolution. Resolution is the degree of detail and precision used in the representation of real world aspects in a model or simulation. It is understood that having a great degree of detail and precision relates to the training simulator’s design including a wide field of view and an area of high resolution at its focus of interest. The image processing loads can be reduced by reducing resolution in the periphery aspect of MTC visualization displays. However, higher resolution MTC visualization displays oftentimes place data in the center of human vision. By doing this, data objects can still be recognized by trainees during exercises. It is well understood that cost is a factor when it comes to improving or increasing resolution. Higher resolutions are better for trainees. However, obtaining it means that more pixels are necessary. With more pixels would come increased weight, heat from active components embedded within the semiconductor material and so forth because more integrated circuit (IC) drivers are required. IC drivers are required because they control pixels and how they are integrated together and connected to visualization display systems; the more pixels, the greater the cost and more complex the manufacturing process. The manufacturing process becomes more complex because of increases in density of circuit integration and of connections between ICs and the visualization display function. Further, the active components are thin-film transistors used as switches for pixels to display high resolution. Such capability is not necessary for low resolution.   For training visualization systems with low resolution, information located within trainee periphery are valuable because trainees can remain aware of the motion of their own air vehicle, in addition to movement of others from intra- and inter-team perspectives and locations of features other entities and CGFs not directly pertinent to trainee’s temporal and spatial domain. Keeping track of low priority items infers a relationship between low resolution (unimportant threats, CGFs, other features and cultural effects and entities along with friends) and granularity (their location according to human periphery and spatial and temporal domain and lack of need for accuracy).3.0 MINIMUM LSC LEVELBelow the authors attempt to establish a minimum LSC level necessary for determining if intra-team DMO MTC federate trainees inside their virtual cockpit simulators can join the inter-team DMO federation, with other participants, and thereby take part in the same training exercises at the same time. 3.1 Intra-Team LSC LevelIntra-team LSC level is not problematic, because where applicable the MTC air vehicle trainers will be 4-ship representations of the same type. By type the authors mean: the same air vehicle type, same level of classification, with same level of capability regarding matters of fidelity, resolution and granularity.  3.2 Inter-Team LSC LevelInter-team LSC level is problematic, because where applicable the MTC air vehicle trainers will be supporting one another in simulated missions and communicating across the network. Depending on air vehicle representation, some forms of communication among pilots and aircrew members are more necessary than are others. Further, to contain DMO cost and for security purposes as well it was assumed that only minimum communication is necessary between F-15C, F-16, AWACS and KC-135.3.3 LSC Level, Fidelity, Resolution And Granularity Also, we conclude that there is a one-to-one relationship between increases in LSC level and granularity and resolution as they relate to simulation fidelity of cultural (human-made roads, buildings, etc.) The DMO Virtual Warfighting System (ViWS) or DMO MTC trainers allow pilots to train in situations without the danger of actually experiencing those predicaments. Moreover, “You can set up situations in the simulator that you can't have in the aircraft without killing yourself”. TABLE 1.0: Notional Criterion for Establishing LSC for SNE, Weather Effects, CGF, and Cultural FeaturesCriterionSynthetic Natural EnvironmentWeather EffectsCGFCultural FeaturesKC-135LLLLF-16L-HL-HL-HL-HF-15L-HL-HL-HL-HTable 1.0 describes environmental factors necessary for MTC air vehicle simulations.

One tele-operation researcher determined that high and low resolution can be accomplished at the same time according to eye movement orientation tracking  ADDIN ENRfu [8]. This researcher referred to as “high resolution insert at the area of interest (AOI)”  ADDIN ENRfu [8]. Display representation of imagery includes low-cost wide and narrow field of view (fov) without large increases in pixels and bandwidth  ADDIN ENRfu [8]. Reingold, et al, reached the same conclusion stating the following concerning bandwidth and machine computation:   Technology users often need or want large, high-resolution displays that exceed possible or practical limits on bandwidth and/or computation resources. In reality, however, much of the information that is generated and transmitted in such displays is wasted because it cannot be resolved by the human visual system, which resolves high-resolution information in only a small region.One way to reduce computation and bandwidth requirements is to reduce the amount of unresolvable information in the display by presenting lower resolution in the visual periphery. Over the last two decades, a great amount of work has been put into developing and implementing gaze-contingent multiresolutional displays (GCMRDs). A GCMRD is a display showing an image with high resolution in one area and lower resolution elsewhere, and the high-resolution area is centered on the viewer's fovea by means of a gaze tracker or other mechanism. Work on such displays is found in a variety of research areas, often using different terms for the same essential concepts. Thus the gaze-contingent aspect of such displays has also been referred to as "foveated" or "eye-slaved" and the multiresolutional aspect is often referred to as "variable resolution," "space variant," "area of interest," or "level of detail." When considered together, gaze-contingent multiresolutional displays have been referred to with various combinations of these terms or simply as "moving windows." Moreover, it shows examples of a short sequence of a viewer's gaze locations in an image and two types of multiresolutional images that might appear during a particular eye fixation  ADDIN ENRfu [9].Cui’s dissertation abstract on the subjects of images, visual communication systems and tele-operations states the following: In tele-operation, visual communication plays an important role as a source of information for control of a remote machine. The main objective of this thesis is to investigate the image merging in a dynamic visual communication system (DVCS) that can provide better visual presentation of the remote machine's working environment to the operator. The conventional VCS such as television cannot provide wide field of view (WFOV) and high resolution at the same time without significantly increasing the number of pixels and the bandwidth which is difficult and expensive. One of the proposed alternatives is to have a high resolution insert at the area of interest (AOI), determined by the observer's current eye orientation, projected into a cutout in the low resolution wide field of view (WFOV) background. This system is called a dynamic VCS (DVCS) in this thesis because of its active feedback control over the viewing scene. A DVCS requires a multi-channel imaging system, dual-resolution presentation, an eye tracker controlling the location of the AOI insert within pixel level accuracy, and an image merging system that can register and fuse AOI and WFOV images, all in real time  ADDIN ENRfu [8].Roll, an USAF technical expert on the subject of training simulation devices states the following, in Table 1.3, when discussing types of training devices and performance and human sensory fidelity:Table 1.3: Comparison of types of resolution [10].Aircrew Training System ExamplesMission Rehearsal Devices (MRD)	[High Fidelity, High Complexity]Weapon System Trainer (WST)Operational Flight Trainer (OFT)Instrument Flight Simulator (IFS)Part Task Trainer (PTT)Cockpit Procedures Trainer (CPT)	[Low Fidelity, Low Complexity]What is performance fidelity? The ability of the training device to ‘replicate’ the exact performance of the aircraft (A/C), i.e., aircraft systems, engines, radar, aerodynamics, malfunctions and cascading effects, handling qualities, A/C performance etc.What is human sensory fidelity? The ability of the training device to reproduce the same kinesthetic, visual, aural, and tactile cues that will elicit the same response from the pilot as in the A/C under the same conditions; i.e. G force onset, visual resolution/acuity (target ID), engine out, “pops”, stick control loading force.As inferred above, granularity a derivation of the words “grain” and “granule” inform us that less resolution or accuracy are necessary. For many years, grain has been associated with photography. Nowadays it is also associated with visualization displays for cockpit simulators whenever the degree of detail and precision, discussed in units dots per inch (dpi) or picture elements (pixels), included in a visualized representation of terrain, features, threats and the like. Whenever the representation has a large amount of granularity or imprecision, it is obvious that its display will be such that one can see individual dots. The converse is true when there is a small of amount of granularity.Table 1.4:  LSC Language Development  ADDIN ENRfu [12].Building VocabularyDecodingCommunicationUnderstandingSyntaxIdentifyingSemanticsIdentifyingContextSpecific SkillsDefiningPattern RecognitionPDU recognitionRecognizing PDU meaningIdentifying cultural background PDUs emanating from various air vehicle MTCsPDUs emanating from other DoD servicesPDUs emanating from ally MTCsPractice and usageRecognizingSymbolsProper use of protocol structureRecognizing connotationsIdentifying historical backgroundAssigning meaningProper use of grammarUsing rhetoricSimulation interoperability based on LSC criterion will require that MTC simulators joining the federation have respectable sized data criterion programmed into their comparative databases for understanding variable received data according to bit pattern recognition and they must be able to distinguish what symbols to display to trainees and how to ascribe meaning to what gets acknowledged and presented and transmitted as information to trainees at other simulators. This means each simulator, in the network, whether receiving or not receiving translations from the portal might require capability to recognize and associate meaning regarding data transmitted using or High Level Architecture (HLA) RTIs. It also means that receiving simulators must understand what constitute proper protocol structure, grammar, connotations, rhetoric, heartbeat, and cultural background protection capability to detect pretext for electronic countermeasures deception intrusion. We use the word countermeasure to mean an action taken to offset another action. Electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM) operate like blood cells defending the body against diseases. Our ECCM for DMO is LSC. In this paper, we state an LSC criterion that serves multiple purposes: to protect the DMO network from transmitted entities that can be classified as intruders and deceivers; to ensure that entities emanating from friendly federate sources be evaluated according to variant criteria for determining if they can or cannot join the federation and what fidelity, resolution and granularity are commensurate with LSC protocol level criteria. That is, as stated above, DMO can be thought operate like a biological entity. Biological entities are susceptible to germs, diseases, viruses and aging (issues concerning reliability and maintainability). Technically, we argue that the DMO network can be likened to a biological neural network. And, like its affinity with the neural network, it is also can be related to biological, anatomical, physiological, psychological, intellectual functions like vision, hearing, language, cognition, intelligence, recognition of patterns, meaning, symbols, structure and so forth. DMO language and communication inculcate PDU, or RTI, grammar, syntax, semantics too. DMO uses a type of artificial intelligence (AI) to provide training information to pilot trainees as though they are component cells making up part of a biological entity.    4.0 DEVELOPMENT OF LSC DECISION-MAKING PROCESSDetermining how to select LSC Criterion is not trivial. It is understood that not all of USAF’s requirements have equal value. Initially engineers will have to collaborate to decide the depth and breadth of contextual instruction for air combatants and learning and training simulation technology vis-à-vis meeting USAF’s needs. Here we provide inquiries for structuring such a decision-making process:1. Centralization of combat readiness issues [2].2. Integration of training with real-life experiences [2].3.Personalization of training [2].4. Visualization of abstract ideas new combat strategies: Presenting abstractions by methods that appeal to one or all of the functions of the five physical senses: seeing, hearing, smelling, touching and tasting [2].5. Demonstration of utility [2]6.Provision of factual combat readiness knowledge on a need-to-know basis. As the trainee increases his or her skill in a particular competency and actually needs to know more, the knowledge base can be increased [2].7. Imparting factual and declarative knowledge to the student on a need-to-know basis. Presenting the information in knowledge bits or modules often removes the knowledge-intimidation factor concerning issues of combat readiness [2].8. How well does the trainee employ complex intellectual operations across various content domains provided by the simulator [2]?9. Tracy*: Negotiation is a motivated process of information exchange between or among simulator systems with the goal of reaching agreement about certain joint or reciprocal acts. These acts may involve management of conflict, exchange of resources, or collaboration on processes directed at the mutual environment.10. Tracy*: If negotiation is successful, it modifies the existing system of interaction between the parties or temporarily establishes a new system, such as a trading partnership or joint venture, which is directed by the terms of the agreement. The authors of the agreement, or some of their components, may then become components of the new system for the duration of its existence.11. Tracy*: In administering an agreement, the authors delegate components of their own decider subsystems to make decisions on behalf of the agreed system in accordance with its template, or else the agreement establishes a separate decider subsystem for the agreed system.12. Tracy*: Possession of a template and a decider subsystem are necessary but not sufficient conditions for establishment of a living DMO system. Other critical subsystems may be dispersed to the author systems or elsewhere. Long-term agreements such as a merger accord or international treaty, however, tend to generate a more nearly totipotential system. Thus, in many cases an agreed system appears to possess all the characteristics of a living system. 13.Tracy*:Some negotiations--for example, plea bargaining or purchasing a right--produce agreements of such short duration that the existence of an agreed system is hardly noticeable. The agreed system may last only long enough to exchange information or to perform required legal acts. Indeed, the agreed system may exist only to dissolve another system. Yet, the fact that the agreed system has a very short lifespan does not negate its existence. Certain cells and micro-organisms likewise have a very brief existence. The key is that, during that brief existence, behavior is governed by the negotiated template and joint decider subsystem.14. Tracy*: Both tacit and verbal negotiation are found at all levels of human activity, as well as between levels. The process of negotiation is employed to reach agreement between and among individuals, groups, organizations, communities, nations or societies, and supranationals. The process has therefore been studied by psychologists, sociologists, economists, industrial relations experts, political scientists, and historians. Game theory, communication theory, economic theory, exchange theory, power theory, and political theory have been employed to analyze and model the negotiation process. Only rarely have these approaches been blended to produce a more complete picture of the process (Coddington, 1968; Kremenyuk, 1991; Strauss, 1988). Furthermore, most approaches focus on individual decision makers and their outcomes rather than the shared process and mutual benefit. 15. Tracy*: Bargaining is employed to set the terms of an exchange of resources. Such negotiations usually create a very temporary agreed system, one that lasts only long enough for the exchange to occur. Nevertheless, the agreement does create an agreed system with a template and a decider subsystem. The decider of the agreed system typically consists of shared components of the deciders of the author systems; the template is the oral or written contract. 16. Tracy*: Some forms of exchange do require a continuing agreed system. * L.

Consequently, levels of standards compliance (LSC) decision-making processes are being developed to understand what levels of communications among simulators, work issues for trainees, integration of training with real-life experiences, personalization of training, visualization of abstract combat scenarios, demonstration of utility, factual knowledge, removal of the intimidation factor, fidelity, resolution and granularity are necessary for the DMO system to deliver the highest quality training at minimum cost. To understand these technological challenges, we viewed DMO to be the integration of four systems. Those are the MTC simulators, the human systems, networks and threat generators. Much work has been done concerning the simulators, networks, and threat generators. However, only a few are addressing simulation interoperability (equipment fidelity, resolution and granularity) vis-à-vis human perceptual fidelity, resolution and granularity as well as the minimum level of communication between simulators to ensure quality training. To better understand such tradeoffs we examined not only the technological aspects of DMO but also adult learning theory and artificial intelligence. That being, how people and machines learn, adjust and adapt. According to Bloom's taxonomy of learning, there are three characteristics of learning: affective, cognitive and psychomotor. DMO will provide insight to USAF decision-makers and technologists about how air combatants might feel about what they are learning during simulated training exercises; if they understand or have attained combat readiness knowledge and intellectual skills; and how well the trainees are able to implement, their psychomotor, physical skills and movement according to simulation training they experience. Moreover, affective, cognitive and psychomotor are instrumental for obtaining combat readiness for human and machine. As stated above, we speculate that artificial intelligence might become a factor in the DMO program.If considered, AI might be applicable to DMO because it can assist in teaching MTC nodes and their control systems how to recognize adapting patterns, symbols, and pretexts for electronic attacks. It is also applicable to LSC and the decision-making process regarding pattern recognition, symbols, security, and levels of resolution, fidelity and granularity.DMO can use its enumerations database to perform a pattern recognition function by using comparative identification. Comparison will involve parsing and matching PDU (sentence and paragraph) data format structure (along with those of its RTI counterparts) to that programmed into the database.DMO exploits developed communication and network technology and the protocol (message) schema for previous communication devices used for person-to-person, person-to-group, and group-to-group exchange of ideas, transfer of experience and so forth through the use of transmission PDUs and RTIs for data distribution management and message ordering. This is notional, of course, but one can easily see a connection between DMO’s networking, its simulators, regulatory system (time, heartbeat, and so forth) and biological functions (heart, intellect, respiration, etc.), nervous system networks, veins, arteries and so forth.Consequently, a biological neural network is any network of neurons or nuclei that operate together to perform some function within the body. When describing DMO or computer architecture for that matter as a neural network, it is not a leap in logic to view digital processors as being connected to other components in a manner suggestive of connections similar to neurons connections; where things can be learned and new or sneak pathways developed by way of trial and error.It is also not a leap to think that DMO simulation training technology is modeled in a manner similar to a biological neural network. Moreover, for DMO MTC simulators to emulate the human nervous system, its protocol, software, and architecture can easily emulate some state conditions of the body’s command, control, respond, transmit, comprehension and sensory function format structure.Also, based on the studies technology and biological negotiation studies conducted by Cui, Roll, Tracy and others, we conclude that there is a one-to-one relationship between increases in LSC level and granularity and resolution as they relate to simulation fidelity of cultural (human-made roads, buildings, etc.) and weather effects, and the ability to transmit, detect and identify RF emissions and determine situation awareness.      Future correspondence will include more detailed results from specific simulation configurations of interest. Similar criterion can be established for training simulator fidelity, resolution and granularity.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSREFERENCES ADDIN ENBbu [1]	A. Daum and M.
