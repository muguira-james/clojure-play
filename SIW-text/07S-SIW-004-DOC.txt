TES has allowed troops to train for practical missions in highly realistic combat environments without the associated risks involved with live weaponry and munitions.  This has been possible because current TES has relied largely upon the Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) and similar systems for a number of years for direct-fire weapons, using a laser to pair the shooter to the potential target(s).  Emerging systems, on the other hand, will use a pairing method called geometric pairing (geo-pairing), which uses a set of data about both the shooter and target, such as locations, weapon orientations, velocities, and weapon projectile velocities, nearby terrain to resolve an engagement.  A previous paper [1] introduces various potential sources of error for a geo-pairing solution.  This paper goes into greater depth regarding the impact of errors that originate within position sensing errors, beginning with a short introduction into the TES system (TESS).  The next section will explain the characteristics of the position sensing hardware and software that may be used by a TESS followed by a mathematical analysis illustrating the impacts of errors within position data.  A summary and conclusion containing recommendations will close this paper.                            IntroductionLegacy tactical engagement simulation systems (TESS) have typically used lasers to pair a shooter and target during a simulated engagement.  While proven to augment training through the decades of its use, the laser has numerous weaknesses for this application.  As such, attempts have been made – and are ongoing – to provide the Army with an improved system that does not rely solely upon lasers to resolve tactical engagements.  This paper, as part of an ongoing series of analysis papers, addresses the issues involved with geometric pairing with regards to terrain representation.The following section begins with a detailed description of the OneTESS program.  OneTESS has implemented geo-pairing for demonstrations that took place in July of 2005, December of 2005 at the Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation & Education Conference, and February of 2006 on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, and thus, provides a perfect context for the subject matter presented herein.The next section provides an explanation of the types of instrumentation that is used to measure weapon orientation and the error associated with those instruments.  That is followed by a mathematical analysis of how those errors can negatively affect the outcome of a geo-pairing algorithm.  The conclusion provides a summary of the paper, and interpretation of the analysis, and suggestions for overcoming the potential sources of error stemming from orientation sensing equipment when implementing geo-pairing.This paper is the fifth in a series of papers detailing and analyzing potential sources of error associated with a geo-pairing solution [2] [3] [4].Tactical Engagement Simulation (TES)OneTESS is the Army’s program for the next-generation of TESS.  For greater context, consider that live training for military purposes dates back millennia [5].  Hand-to-hand combat drills under highly constrained conditions and target practice likely have histories as long as that of warfare, itself.  With the introduction of the Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) in the 1970s, live, tactical training took a quantum leap forward.  For the first time, soldiers could conduct force-on-force training under safe and, at the same time, relatively unconstrained conditions, closely reflecting the conditions experienced during actual warfare.  The application of what was then state-of-the-art laser technology enabled this advance, but this technology now faces two significant disadvantages: Lasers cannot represent indirect fire, or Non-Line-of-Sight/Beyond-Line-of-Sight (NLOS/BLOS) engagements without additional support, such as what is provided by Simulated Area Weapon Effects – Radio Frequency (SAWE-RF)Opaque and translucent obscurants that do not stop bullets, such as foliage and fog, can block laser beamsFigure 1 opposite shows a military training exercise taking place with the use of MILES equipment.  Note the equipment that makes up MILES.  The weapons in the photograph have attachments on the ends that look like metal boxes, approximately 1” X 2” X 3” in size.  These attachments fire the infrared encoded laser beams that constitute an electronic bullet.  These infrared pulses must intersect with one of numerous sensors integrated within the soldiers’ clothing.  In the picture, these sensors can be easily differentiated from the rest of the equipment as black circles, approximately one inch in diameter.  These sensors are most noticeable in a halo pattern on the Kevlar helmets and on straps going down the soldiers’ ribcages.Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 1.  Soldiers training using MILES equipmentOneTESS is intended to address this shortcoming with current equipment as well as others that have been identified over the many years of MILES service.  As such, OneTESS will support Force-on-Force (FOF) and Force-on-Target (FOT) training exercises at the Brigade level and below in all Battlefield Operating Systems at Homestation, maneuver Combat Training Centers, and deployed sites using technologies other than just lasers to pair shooters to the potential targets.  As part of these goals, OneTESS will simulate a multitude of different engagements, proper doctrines, and weapon capabilities as well as stimulate detectors, sensors, monitors and countermeasures [6].  As mentioned previously, in legacy TESS, the most common method of pairing the shooter to potential targets is with the use of infrared laser beams.  However, this paper has already identified weaknesses of this approach.  Thus, OneTESS will use a pairing method called geometric pairing (geo-pairing).  Geo-pairing uses a collection of data about the shooter, the target, and the terrain.  That data includes:Location of the shooterLocation of the targetTime of the trigger pullCharacteristics of the weapon and its ammunitionOrientation vector of the weaponAtmospheric conditionsTerrain dataEarth modelThe three dimensional positions of the shooters and targets, or rather the accuracy of such, greatly impact the accuracy with which a geo-pairing algorithm can pair a shooter to its targets.  The following section describes the  position sensing equipment that likely would be used with TESS in general and OneTESS, specifically.Position SensingTo determine position/location information about the shooter and targets during a OneTESS exercise, the main technology that will be employed is the Global Positioning System (GPS).  On the ground, a GPS system consists of a receiver that connects wirelessly to at least three satellites.  Figure 2 below shows a GPS receiver manufactured by Magellan.Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 2.  A Magellan Blazer 12 GPS receiver [7]The GPS receiver determines its location on Earth by measuring its distance between at least three of the GPS satellites.  Taking into account the speed of light and measuring the amount of time it takes for the transmission and reception of a GPS radio signal allows the distance between receiver and satellites to be calculated.  Additionally, the signals communicate information about the satellites’ respective locations.  Using this data and a process called trilateration – a method of determining relative positions of objects based upon the distances between a source and at least two reference points – the receiver calculates its own position on the surface of the earth.  The third necessary satellite is to track the receiver clock, as they are not perfectly accurate [8].  Figure 3, opposite, shows an example of trilateration.  In this illustration, the object located at B wishes to determine its position relative to P1, P2, and P3 on a two-dimensional plane.  By first measuring r1, the position of B is narrowed down to a position on the edge of a single circle.  Next, by measuring r2, the position is narrowed down to just two points, A and B.  The third and final measurement, r3, shows the position to be at B.  Subsequent measurements can be made to increase the accuracy.  Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 3.  Example of trilateration [9]The following subsections provide some information regarding the accuracy of various GPS systems.Important Notes on GPS AccuracyVarious GPS technologies provide differing levels of accuracy.  For the OneTESS trade study, five main technologies were evaluated:Autonomous GPSSatellite-Based Augmentation System (SBAS) Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS)Differentiated GPSCarrier Phase MeasurementThe following subsections provide brief descriptions of each with characteristics describing the respective accuracy capabilities [10].Autonomous GPS AccuracyAutonomous GPS involves the use of GPS receiver equipment that produces a positioning solution without any corrections.  This type of GPS receiver uses trilateration to determine an object’s position without the use of signal processing techniques that minimize the effects of multi-path errors and atmospheric disturbances.Generally speaking, autonomous GPS receivers can provide positions with accuracy levels of better than 5 meters 95% of the time and 3 meters 50% of the time.  In this form of GPS technology, no additional equipment such as base stations or ground receivers, are necessary [10].Satellite-Based Augmentation of GPS AccuracySatellite-Based Augmentation System (SBAS) Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) GPS provides greater accuracy than the autonomous GPS described in the previous section.  This system uses ground reference stations that monitor GPS satellite data and master stations that collect data from the ground reference stations to generate GPS correction messages that account for GPS satellite orbit and clock drift, as well as signal delays resulting from disturbances in the atmosphere.  Once the data is corrected, the signal is broadcast through geostationary satellites, whereas any WAAS-enabled GPS receiver can read the signal.  SBAS WAAS requires no additional equipment and can provide positions with accuracy levels of 3 meters 95% of the time and 1 meter 50% of the time, clearly an improvement upon the autonomous GPS [10].Differential Global Positioning System AccuracyDifferential Global Position System (DGPS) works in similar fashion to SBAS WAAS with the exception that it requires additional transceiver equipment.  To receive DGPS signals, a DGPS base station transceiver and a rover receiver are necessary.  Because the base station transmitter and the rover receiver operate within line of sight, the closer the rover receiver is to the base station transmitter the greater the accuracy.  Data corrections are produced by placing a base station transceiver on a known reference point and then measuring the error in the computed position versus the known position.  This correction is transmitted to the nearby rover receivers.This technology allows the GPS to have accuracy levels of 1.5 meters 95% of the time and 0.8 meters 50% of the time, another significant improvement over the previously mentioned technologies [10].Carrier-Phase Measurement AccuracyCarrier-Phase measurement involves the use of a high frequency carrier signal to calculate the travel time between the satellite and the receiver.  Because of the much higher frequency of the carrier signal, the trilateration calculation is far more accurate.  It should be noted that carrier-phase measurements provide more accurate timing differences that can be used to derive more accurate position measurements, as opposed to directly improving the position measurement accuracy.The use of carrier-phase receivers involves more post-processing, stricter data collection requirements, and a clear line-of-sight view of the satellites to maintain a lock with at least four satellites.  However, it also results in accuracy levels of less than one meter [10].Table 1 below shows a subset of the characteristics researched for the OneTESS GPS trade study.  This table is not intended to demonstrate goodness or applicability to OneTESS, as other critical factors such as weight, size, and cost have been left out.  Instead, its intention is to provide a picture of the capabilities of typical GPS instrumentation that has been considered for OneTESS.Table 1.

Note that this average has no meaning at all outside of this analysis presented in this paper and only symbolizes a starting point for that analysis, presented in the following section.Mathematical AnalysisThe previous sections provided an understanding as to the variety of position sensors available and how accurately they each perform their job.  This section takes that understanding and reveals the performance of a generic position sensor used for geo-pairing.  Applications of the position sensor to direct and indirect fire weapons are considered at both the shooter and target.It should be noted that for the duration of this paper two terms refer to specific concepts:Sensor-based weapon – a modeled weapon that relies upon two position sensors (shooter and target) and assumes perfect aim to resolve simulated engagements using a geo-pairing solutionPhysical weapon – an actual weapon used in the course of battleTo begin, this section briefly describes the methods for modeling the position errors and determining the accuracy of the model for both direct and indirect fire. Because these are thoroughly described in [7], this paper only summarizes instead of delving deeply into the methodology.  Rather, the aim is to provide a sufficient understanding of the method used for the sake of illustrating the impact that this nature of error has in the accuracy of a geo-pairing solution.  That is followed by a description of the effort to model a generic position sensor using the method described and its performance, measured as the percentage accuracy of correct outcome with respect to the physical weapon’s accuracy of correct outcome engaging a 0.5 meter wide by 1.5 meter tall, planar target.Modeling Sensor AccuracyThe approach used for the work described in this paper is to model the sensors’ error distributions and weapon dispersion, and to use those models in a computational tool to determine the performance of a pair of position sensors with respect to a specific weapon.  The following subsection first describes how the distributions work, then provides an overview of the determination of a correct shot, and, lastly, explains how to put the two components together to determine the performance of the sensors responsible for modeling the physical weapon.Error DistributionsPosition sensor measurements tend to follow a normal distribution.  This also holds true for weapon dispersions, as they also follow a normal distribution. Thus, the error distributions used here are normal distributions centered on the nominal.  Therefore, a point at 0 in the normal distribution represents no error and would have the highest probability.  For this work, these distributions were discretized – or separated – into a finite and specific number of bins.    Each bin in the distribution corresponds to one measurement, and, since the distributions are finite, maximum errors are defined near the tails of the normal distribution. These maximum errors correspond with 3 sigma values in the distribution and encompass 99.7% of the possible error values.Figure 4, opposite, illustrates a normal distribution with discrete sections.  This curve demonstrates the notion of the error distributions used within the analysis portion of this paper.Figure 4.  Normal distribution with discrete sectionsShot ResolutionIn this study, the term direct fire describes weapons with a nearly linear trajectory, such as small-arms.  With that in mind, a shot resolves as a hit if the shot vector – the vector that describes the flight path of a projectile – when projected out to the range of the target, intersects with the target.  For the physical weapon, the source of error is the dispersion of the weapon.  For the sensor-based weapon the sources of error are the position sensors on the shooter and target. Therefore, the physical model is concerned with the following four parameters:Azimuth of the dispersionElevation of the dispersionHeight of the targetWidth of the targetFor the sensor-based model, the following four parameters are considered:2D Position error of the shooter2D Position error of the targetHeight of the targetWidth of the targetIt is assumed that the shot is perfectly aimed at the center of mass of the target and, thus, error values from the error distribution for both azimuth and elevation are selected to alter the perfectly aimed shot vector for the physical model.  With the sensor-based model, error values from the error distribution for x and y offsets are selected independently for both the shooter and the target’s position to determine the translation to perform to the shot vector of the sensor model.  These steps are performed for both shots, modeling the physical weapon – weapon dispersion – and shots modeling a sensor-based weapon – sensor measurement errors. This process is performed over all possible error combinations in azimuth and elevation, from weapon dispersion, and all possible error combinations in x and y offsets, from position sensors, to determine the performance of the weapon as described in the following section.System PerformanceThis section aims to characterize the performance of a direct fire weapon with a predefined maximum variation in its shot vector.Both the physical weapon and the sensor-based weapon vary in their shot vector from shot to shot.  So, 100% accurate position sensors are not needed, or necessarily even desired.  Instead, it must match the probability of hit or miss of physical weapon it is modeling.  Thus, the ability of a sensor-based weapon to reflect the same outcome is determined. That is, whether the model resolves as a hit or miss, as compared to the physical weapon it is modeling to measure its performance. When using this methodology, choosing a representative target size is critical.  For the study, a 0.5 meter wide by 1.5 meter tall target is used to correspond roughly with the potential size of a dismounted infantry.  Matching the same physical outcome – that is, matching the exact trajectory of the physical shot – is not examined because it requires incredibly accurate sensors as mentioned in [11].The purpose of this experimentation is to determine the probability of correct outcome for a sensor-based weapon and compare it to the probability of correct outcome for the physical weapon modeled.  To accomplish this, the probability of correct outcome for the physical weapon is computed first followed by the probability of correct outcome for the sensor-based weapon.  The probability of correct outcome is computed by evaluating every possible error combination for all error sources, applying it to the appropriate engagement model, and determining whether the correct outcome occurs.  In all cases with perfect aim, the correct outcome equates to hitting the target.  If the target is hit, the probability of each applied error is extracted from its error distribution and combined all together to determine the probability of this combination of errors occurring.  All combinations that result in the correct outcome are then added together.  The resulting value is the probability of correct outcome for the sensor-based or physical weapon with the given error distributions.  The calculated number for the sensor-based weapon is compared to the probability of correct outcome for the physical weapon.  If the sensor-based weapon has the same or larger probability of correct outcome as the physical weapon then it can accurately model the physical weapon.  If it does not, then a proportion of sensor-based weapon probability of correct outcome to physical weapon probability of correct outcome indicates the accuracy of the sensor-based weapon with respect to the physical weapon.ResultsThis paper strictly addresses the error introduced to a geo-pairing solution by the position sensor components.  The effects of the orientation sensor independent of the position sensors on a geo-pairing solution are described in [3] and the effects of both the orientation sensor and position sensors on a geo-pairing solution are described in [11].  To demonstrate the inaccuracy that is introduced by current position sensors, the average position sensor accuracy represented by current technology is modeled.  As mentioned at the end of section 3, this study was conducted using data from current position sensors, resulting in a composite position sensor with an accuracy of 1.84 meters in x and y.The results shown in this paper are presented in tabular form.  The results are produced by discretizing the error distributions into 80 bins.  The table is labeled with the maximum (3 sigma) errors for the position sensor and the rows represent the different ranges of the engagement and the percent accuracy of the sensor-based weapon.  The percentages represent how well the physical weapon is modeled by the sensor-based weapon with the given position sensor errors.Direct Fire ResultsTo analyze the performance of the position sensors, as explained in Section 4.1.3, the accuracy of the physical weapon must be defined as a basis for comparison.  The physical weapon chosen to be modeled for direct fire is an average rifle with groupings of about 3 inches at 100 yards, or 7.5 cm at 91 meters.  The probability of correct outcome is abbreviated as Pco.  Both Pco values for sensor and weapon are represented as percentages, along with the sensor accuracy.Table 2 below shows the results of the direct fire analysis.Table 2. Accuracy of today’s position sensors in modeling the average rifle (0.5 m x 1.5 m target)Range(meters)Pco(sensor)(%)Pco(weapon)Sensor Accuracy5029.2610029.2610029.2610029.2620029.2610029.2640029.2699.8629.3080029.2688.8632.93There is an obvious trend that as the range of engagement increases, the ability of the sensors to accurately model the weapon’s probability of correct outcome stays nearly the same.  This is caused by the position sensor error’s independence of the range of the engagement.  It does appear as the range would continue to increase that the accuracy of the sensor-based weapon would increase as well.  This is because the accuracy of the physical weapon is dependent on range, because dispersion is an angular error.  As the range of engagement increases, the size of the target relative to the range decreases, thus making the target more difficult to hit for the physical weapon. The position sensors still have a long way to improve before they would be sufficient for modeling direct fire at short ranges, as they result in a sensor-based weapon with one-third the accuracy of the physical weapon.  Thus it is clear that the accuracy of current position sensors does not sufficiently model the average current small arm.Indirect Fire ResultsWhen considering indirect fire engagements, the problem of determining the accuracy of a sensor-based weapon with regards to the physical weapon becomes significantly more difficult.  Determining the accuracy for a direct fire engagement appears straightforward, but a question regarding indirect fire must be posed because of the area weapons effects associated with indirect fire munitions.  Can the accuracy of an indirect fire engagement truly be determined?  To address this question, this study looks simply at the case where an indirect fire weapon is aimed toward just one target.  If that target is within the burst radius – or kill radius – of the weapon munition, then the sensor-based weapon accurately performed to the parameters of the physical weapon, assuming the physical weapon would have produced a hit.This study recognizes the limitations of this method that result from not accounting for an engagement intended to affect multiple targets or the false positives that would occur if a sensor-based weapon’s shot hit targets that the physical weapon’s shot would not hit.  A more comprehensive model is thoroughly described in [11].For this study of indirect fire engagements, a crew-served weapon with an accuracy of 25 meters at range of 2000 meters, with a burst radius of 10 meters, and a muzzle velocity of 250 meters per second is examined.  Ranges beginning at 500 meters out to 2000 meters are considered.  To simplify, it is assumed that the munition explodes upon impact with the ground and thus, only simple ballistics flyout models for the munition are used.  Therefore, only the initial velocity and gravity affect the trajectory of the munition, meaning that no drag or other variables are considered.The same average position sensor that was used in the direct fire study is used in the indirect fire study: an accuracy of 1.84 meters in x and y.  Recall that Pco represents the probability of correct outcome.Table 3 opposite shows the results of the indirect fire analysis.Table 3. Accuracy of today’s position sensors in modeling a crew-served indirect fire weapon (0.5 m wide target)Range(meters)Pco(sensor)(%)Pco(weapon)Sensor Accuracy50010022.50100100010022.10100150010020.65100200010018.76100The results reveal that for an acceptably accurate generic crew-served weapon, current position sensors are capable of manifesting a sensor-based weapon that matches or exceeds the accuracy of the physical weapon.  However, one should note that this study focuses strictly on hitting a single point target and does not account for situations in which other targets may or may not have been hit in the process of the engagement.  This type of scenario is further studied and reported in [11].The results also reveal that the sensor-based weapon is always correct in hitting the target.  This phenomenon occurs because half of the burst radius of the indirect fire munition (5 m) is still larger than the largest possible difference in position readings due to sensor errors between the shooter and target (1.84 x 2 = 3.68 m).  Since the position sensors errors can never exceed that threshold, the target will always be in the burst radius of the munition.Summary and ConclusionAs the other papers in this series have demonstrated in varying levels of detail and areas of concern, in a geo-pairing solution for engagement resolution, numerous sources of error can propogate.  In this case, the accuracy of the position sensor component for both the shooter and the targets has been examined closely.  For OneTESS, that is GPS accuracy.Just with all measuring hardware, GPS instruments possess limitations in how accurately they can report their position.  This fact is true regardless of any augmentation technology used.  These limitations are often the result of:Physical constraintsMethodologyQuality of componentsQuality of other related subcomponentsIt should be noted that this study did not aim to identify the best possible GPS equipment for OneTESS, but to define the parameters of an average GPS receiver – and associated equipment – and to study the effects of its accuracy limitations upon a geo-pairing algorithm.To that end, the mathematical analysis, performed using modeling and simulation techniques, demonstrates conclusively that the accuracy affects the results of geo-pairing.  This is shown by comparing the results of a fictionalized GPS sensor based upon a collection of actual sensors studied by the OneTESS technology assessment team to the results of an actual weapon that meets its design specifications.Unlike the study conducted in [3] which showed that the range of the engagement significantly impacted the accuracy of the engagement outcome, this analysis showed that the correctness of an engagement with respect to the positions of the shooter and targets is independent of range.  However, this study also revealed that the type of engagement – direct fire or indirect fire – does still affect the results with respect to the GPS accuracy.  The experimental results also show that the capabilities of the GPS sensor impacted the results of a direct fire engagement while having little or no affect at all upon an indirect fire engagement when half the burst radius of the munition is larger than the total combined error from the shooter’s and targets’ GPS sensors.The most feasible solution to this issue is likely going to be a balance between GPS augmentation techniques and cost.  As discussed in section 3, numerous techniques exist for improving the accuracy of a GPS receiver to sub-meter levels, however this introduces more equipment into the system.  Because of this associated cost – both physical and monetary – the balance must be struck to satisfy the accuracy requirements and expectations without becoming prohibitively costly.References[1]	Ford, Louis, and B.
