Name of Forum or Group:  Distributed Simulation Process & Tools (DSPT)ChairJake BorahVice ChairJane BachmanSecretaryPierre GauvinObjectives for this Workshop: DiscussProcesses for developing distributed simulationsTools for developing distributed simulationsExercise planning and managementComments and Recommendations:1. Comments from 06F-SIW-012, “War in a Box: A Canadian Experiment in Federation Development”:Review of Canadian Advanced Synthetic Environment (CASE) initiative.Scheduling of demonstration conflicted with real world use of training simulationChose HLA vice DIS to view additional capabilities to model Canadians functioning as in real worldWIB West Africa NEO scenario initially not viewed as realistic, but recent events have validated using itSpinning of the wheels in using FEDEP until expert advisors brought on board.Challenge for SE was to incorporate existing assets into functioning federation, without a cohesive scenario or conceptual modelingMore attention to communication links needed because service groups not use to talking togetherIntegration of multiple assets tough due to the availability of simulationsReference FOMs are good, perhaps better than raw FEDEPRecommendations:RPR FOM 2 needs to be standardizedCanadian enumerations are needed in RPR FOM   2. Comments from 06F-SIW-024, “A Management Overview of the HLA Evolved Web Service API”:Overview of family of papers relating to HLA Evolved Web ServicesSuccess factorsHeavily promoted by major IT vendorsSmooth evolution of technologiesHardware/software independenceA technology with a business modelLimitationsStandard often poorly implementedModest PerformanceFragmented Information ModelExaggerated expectations on new business modelPerformance ComparisonThree approaches presented to illustrate pros and cons of web service APIDiscussion of additional engineering supportXMSF work by Katherine MorseI/TSEC 2005 FederationService group testsFederate in a cell phonehttps tests (secure and authenticated)Substantial advantages and some limitationsRecommendation:Web services API promotes the concept of simulations as readily available services provided within and between enterprises.3. Comments from 06F-SIW-058, “Development if a Testing Environment for the HLA Evolved Web-based API” (Joint Session with CFI forum: 46 attendees)Key points:RTI Verifier Design discussionRTI Verifier Process discussionComparison of three options for verificationLocal verificationManual Remote VerificationAutomated Remote VerificationRecommendation:RTI verification process chosen for Web Service RTIs will depend on the needs of the HLA community and financial priorities of the US DoD4. Recommendations from 06F-SIW-100, “So You Want to Develop a Standard? Tales to Share from the BOM PDG Chronicles”:When forming the PDG, leadership is important and maintaining an open environment.Full participation of the PDG is vital to the success of the group.Use of “trial period” is helpful.SAC is there for support and is very helpful regarding comment/balloting process.Untrue Myth-SISO is not responsive to community needs—standards development takes too long, but hold on, volunteer effort and issue maturity are true constraints5. Comments from 06F-SIW-047, “Interchanging Discrete Event Simulation Models Using PIMODES and SRML”:Research focused on sharing simulation models in discrete event simulationReuse has been proffered as a solution for the length and expense of simulation developmentModel interchange challengesCommunicationSyntaxSemanticsW3C manages specifications for a variety of standards that support interchangeRecommendations:SRML should be upgraded to leverage new interchange technologiesSRML could be foundation for a new simulation OntologyStandardize SRML DES supportSimplify PIMODESContinue evolve both SRML and PIMODES6. Comments from 06F-SIW-034, “AOP and the HLA: Simplified Federation Development”:Two Main Categories of Tools used for simulation (Spreadsheet and Specialized)Tool-Specific Interfaces tried as a solution for the complexity of HLA Federation Development but was not really successfulModel Driven Architecture not useful as an alternative approach for a lot of reasonsAspect Oriented Programming (AOP) is another potential alternative approachAOP Reference Implementation availability highly depended upon commercial Intellectual Property issues resolutionRecommendations:AOP can provide real benefits, remove barriers and enable broader uptake7. Comments from 06F-SIW-035, “Open Source and the HLA: I Swear It’s Here Somewhere”:Open Source Software (OSS) is widely used in commercial environmentsOSS has several benefitsCostIndependenceFlexibilityPooling of EffortSecurity and AuditingDevelopment Speed and FocusCompetitive AdvantageOSS community hard to find in HLA environments for several reasons:Heavy proprietary focusLack of community contributionContracts actively restrict contributionSolving this problem requires a using a larger perspective viewLittle Blue Frog Labs (a three person effort) formed in Australia to produce OSS toolsOSS can coexist with commercial software as it doesn’t have to be all OSS or nothing software environment8. Comments from 06F-SIW-019, “Automated HLA Federation Interoperability Testing Tools” :NAVAIR SBIR sponsored project developing MäK toolsm RTIexec, RTIspy, and FOMspy toolsTools available with next release of MäK RTI9. Comments from 06F-SIW-087, “Creating Dynamic Logical Overlay Networks for Distributed Simulations”:Presentation keyed to DIS distributed simulation environmentsUnauthorized simulations present in LANs or WANs are a potential problemDoD Protection Levels defined as Protection Level (PL)1 or PL2Seeking to use Session Initiation Protocol to address security within distributed simulation environment in addition to other features already resident in SIPSIP hardware can be added to existing communication facilitiesExperiment successfully conducted between Wright-Patterson AFB and Hanscom AFBThree sites experiment being planned using SIP conferencing.Testing with TENA and HLA environments also being planned Recommendation:Higher level PLs could be reached by adding encryption and other security techniquesAverage attendance (excluding joint sessions)40Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)56Peak attendance (including joint sessions)56Total papers presented9“No-show” presentations0Other presentations and panel discussions01 cancelled pre-conference via IST support messaging.Recommended Reading List nomination: 06F-SIW-01206F-SIW-024                 2006 FALL SIW OUTBRIEF FORM
