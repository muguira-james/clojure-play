In order to build an effective system, the program must identify training objectives and the critical capabilities needed to accomplish those objectives.   These capabilities will determine the priorities for technology and system development.This paper describes an analysis process that uses training objectives to determine system requirements.  In particular, we identify computer generated forces (CGF) requirements from training objectives.  We first identify the training objectives and analyze what decisions and actions are required in the objective tasks.  This analysis indicates how the decisions and actions are influenced by factors in the environment.  We next develop the specific situations appropriate for meeting the training objectives.  The situations are then analyzed to determine what CGF capabilities are required to support these situationsIntroductionProject BackgroundVIRTE (Virtual Technologies and Environments) is a major program within the Office of Naval Research's Capable Manpower FNC (Future Naval Capability).

VIRTE Demo II is in a technology development phase during which training requirements, technical challenges and program resources are all being examined to determine the scope of capabilities in the final system.System ObjectivesThe primary goal of developing any virtual environment (VE) simulation-based training system is to provide a level of training that translates to enhanced performance of the real world task being simulated.  To do this requires that the system instantiate both an environment and a scenario. The former consists of the computer generated framework, which stimulates as many senses as possible and into which the user will be immersed with intent of experiencing a solid training event. The latter is the conceptual framework within which the training is given, which can include event-based cues, etc. Typical environments can be visually rich in objects, with accompanying auditory, haptic and even olfactory cues. The provision of these cues is a necessary, but not sufficient, criterion for ensuring successful training. That is, the training benefit derives not only from providing this multi-sensory backdrop, but from the degree to which the users—immersed within this stimulating framework—are compelled to interact with the environment. It is through this interaction that training benefit derives, ultimately making training transfer more likely.Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 1a Basic training transfer framework;, see text for details. 1b  Specific application of framework to VIRTE.Ford, Smith, Weissbein, Gully and Salas  ADDIN EN.CITE <EndNote><Cite><Author>Ford</Author><Year>1998</Year><RecNum>8</RecNum><MDL><REFERENCE_TYPE>0</REFERENCE_TYPE><AUTHORS><AUTHOR>Ford, J.</AUTHOR><AUTHOR>Smith, E.</AUTHOR><AUTHOR>Weissbein, D.</AUTHOR><AUTHOR>Gull, S.</AUTHOR><AUTHOR>Salas, E.</AUTHOR></AUTHORS><YEAR>1998</YEAR><TITLE>Relationshiops of Goal Orientation, Metacognitive Activity and Practice Strategies with Learning Outcomes and Transfer</TITLE><SECONDARY_TITLE>Journal of Applied Psychology</SECONDARY_TITLE><VOLUME>83</VOLUME><NUMBER>2</NUMBER><PAGES>218-233</PAGES><KEYWORDS><KEYWORD>training methods</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>training effectiveness</KEYWORD></KEYWORDS></MDL></Cite></EndNote>[2] have developed a model of learning transfer that has as its end-state demonstrated transfer of training.  REF _Ref48553079  \* MERGEFORMAT Figure 1a depicts a model, based in part on this work that captures the overall framework for training transfer, within which training techniques can be developed, instantiated and evaluated in training simulations.  The most important decision occurs early on, after the training domain has been selected, with the determination of the overall training architecture. This decision is based on the skill level of the trainee. A trainee with low skill level may need more basic, procedures-based training, focusing on developing simple perceptuo-motor skills, whereas a trainee with a high skill level may require more abstract, cognitive training. Once the skill level of the trainee has been determined, the training objectives can be catalogued. Objectives may include training procedures and solutions to specific types of problems, or training more complex skills, such as the ability to generalize from a well-learned skill set to a novel environment/challenge. The next choice focuses on the training strategy or how the training will be conveyed to the trainee. Training strategy can be considered in terms of metacognition, the degree to which a trainee monitors or is aware of their overall thought/action processes as they progress through a training event  ADDIN EN.CITE <EndNote><Cite><Author>Flavell</Author><Year>1979</Year><RecNum>9</RecNum><MDL><REFERENCE_TYPE>0</REFERENCE_TYPE><AUTHORS><AUTHOR>Flavell, J.

Thus, as decisions about the training system design are made, ensuring that trainees have the opportunity to ‘think about’ their performance and determine, on their own, how to improve, is critical. Once these factors have been determined, they must be instantiated in a solid system design, embodied in the training environment. Decisions at this level include which sensory modalities to incorporate, what types of Human-Computer Interfaces will be required to achieve this task and so forth. This is the part of the framework that defines the VE.  All these decisions will ultimately be enveloped within the choice of training scenario.  REF _Ref48553079  \* MERGEFORMAT Figure 1b shows a model specific for the VIRTE applications. SHAPE  \* MERGEFORMAT VE System Design ConstraintsWhile it is desirable to make a VE training system as realistic as possible, the fidelity of the system is limited by technology, funding and time.  For example, in terms of developing an environment to support transfer of training, a common approach among system developers has been to try and match, in the virtual system, as much of the real world as possible  ADDIN EN.CITE <EndNote><Cite><Author>Cohn</Author><Year>2001</Year><RecNum>7</RecNum><MDL><REFERENCE_TYPE>3</REFERENCE_TYPE><AUTHORS><AUTHOR>Cohn, Joseph V.</AUTHOR><AUTHOR>Breaux, Robert B.</AUTHOR><AUTHOR>HNguyen, L.

This has been canonized by such slogans as the Army’s ‘Train as we fight, Fight as we train.’ This is, of course, a costly proposition and, in the absence of user-based guidelines, likely to require an infinite amount of time. A more ideal approach is to strike a balance between matching every aspect of the real world and identifying those elements of the real world that are critical for supporting the chosen training domain. This entails identifying those elements in the real world which must be modeled, identically, in the virtual one. Those elements thus chosen are termed identical elements. While this may seem reasonable in theory, actually identifying these elements becomes increasingly difficult as the tasks being simulated grow in complexity.One part of the VE that illustrates these constraints is the computer generated forces (CGF).  In VIRTE, CGF will play the role of the threat forces.  REF _Ref40361323  \* MERGEFORMAT Figure 2 shows how the CGF simulation must model elements analagous to those in the immersive, human-in-the-loop (HITL) platform.  In addition to modelling the inanimate environment, the CGF must model human behavior. Many aspects of behavior could be modeled, including engaging opponents with weapons, moving to new firing positions, planning a defense of the building, developing an awareness (perception and understanding) of the situation, communicating with and working with team mates, suffering from fatigue, making mistakes, feeling fear, responding to emotions, etc.  As with the environment, it is infeasible within the scope of the project to produce a high fidelity model of all possible behavior. Requirements AnalysisWe have begun to use the decisions made in the training transfer framework to prioritize the modeling of identical elements in the virtual environment. The use of training objectives to drive modeling requirements has been proposed before  ADDIN EN.CITE <EndNote><Cite><Author>Gallier</Author><Year>2002</Year><RecNum>115</RecNum><MDL><REFERENCE_TYPE>3</REFERENCE_TYPE><AUTHORS><AUTHOR>Gallier, Nigel P.</AUTHOR></AUTHORS><YEAR>2002</YEAR><TITLE>The Requirement for Effective Military Training</TITLE><SECONDARY_TITLE>2002 Spring Simulation Interoperability Workshop</SECONDARY_TITLE><PLACE_PUBLISHED>Orlando, Florida</PLACE_PUBLISHED><PUBLISHER>Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization</PUBLISHER><KEYWORDS><KEYWORD>Training effectiveness</KEYWORD></KEYWORDS></MDL></Cite><Cite><Author>Haines</Author><Year>2000</Year><RecNum>116</RecNum><MDL><REFERENCE_TYPE>3</REFERENCE_TYPE><AUTHORS><AUTHOR>Haines, Carl</AUTHOR><AUTHOR>Severinghaus, Richard</AUTHOR><AUTHOR>Belke, Tom</AUTHOR><AUTHOR>Clare, Todd</AUTHOR></AUTHORS><YEAR>2000</YEAR><TITLE>Measuring Training Effectiveness in the Simulation Domain</TITLE><SECONDARY_TITLE>2000 Fall Simulation Interoperability Workshop</SECONDARY_TITLE><PLACE_PUBLISHED>Orlando, Florida</PLACE_PUBLISHED><PUBLISHER>Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization</PUBLISHER><KEYWORDS><KEYWORD>Training effectiveness</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Performance measurement and improvement</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PDA</KEYWORD></KEYWORDS></MDL></Cite></EndNote>[5, 6], but not generally with specific guidance as to how to accomplish this. This paper presents the interim results of our effort to develop a requirements analysis process for the CGF component of the VE. Section  REF _Ref48554928 \r 2 presents the process we have developed so far.  Section 3 illustrates this process with a subset of the training objectives having to do with clearing a room.  Finally, section 4 concludes with a discussion and summary.Analysis of Training Objectives EMBED Word.Picture.8  Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 2. VIRTE Demo II configuration of Human in the Loop  and CGF system REF _Ref36890154  \* MERGEFORMAT Figure 3 shows in simplified form how the Demo II system may be used to meet Marine Corps CQB training objectives.  The simulation will present the trainees with specific situations.  In these situations, the trainees will be required to make decisions and take actions.  The situation will then play out with enemy entities reacting to the trainees.  The result will either be successful completion of the task, or a less desirable result that may include trainee casualties.  The Demo II system will collect data to help instructors determine whether the trainees performed their tasks according to standards, and provide the trainees with feedback on their performance.  When they have repeated the exercise and learned how to perform the task successfully, the training objective will (hopefully) be met. EMBED Word.Picture.8  Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 3. Training with the VIRTE systemThe situations needed for meeting training objectives can be used to develop the requirements for the simulation environment and for CGF behavior.  For example, if the training objective includes shooting through walls then this capability must be included in the Demo II system. In this analysis, we seek to identify training scenes so that CGF system requirements can be derived.In order to identify appropriate training scenes, we will work backwards through the process shown in  REF _Ref36890154  \* MERGEFORMAT Figure 3.  That is, we willIdentify the training objectivesIdentify decisions and actions required as part of the training objectivesIdentify factors contributing to decisions and undesirable results for incorrect decisions and actionsDevelop scenes that require trainees to make those decisions and take actions.The first step in developing scenes is to define the training objectives. The Demo II training objectives are discussed in Section  REF _Ref46800250 \r 3 below. These training objectives must be analyzed to determine what decisions or actions they require of the trainees.Once the decisions and actions are identified, the cues or factors in the situation that impact the decisions are determined.  These factors may include the threat situation, the geometry of the environment, the unit status, standard operating procedures, etc.  The different possible values for each factor are identified, and then different situations are created to present trainees with the range of values for each factor.    Theoretically the training system could exercise all paths through the trainee’s decision logic.Similarly, we explicitly identify consequences that could result if decisions are made incorrectly or skills are performed incorrectly.  It is useful to group such negative consequences into three basic types. (1) Natural outcomes, that occur due to a physical chain of events initiated by the trainee. These include fragmentation grenades penetrating soft walls and team members getting in each others way moving through a small space. (2) Opponent reactions, that occur when a vigilant opponent responds to the trainees actions. These includes when the opponent detects the trainee unintentionally signaling his presence or tossing the trainee's grenade back at him. And (3) forced coincidences (bad luck), that occur when the system detects an oversight and changes the opponents course of action to produce a negative outcome. The opposition's course of action is changed based on information that the opponent could not sense directly. These include having enemy patrol parties appear when the team posts insufficient security and when an opponent may suddenly 'materialize' in a corner a trainee neglected to search.Natural outcomes depend solely on the user's actions and the causal laws of physics. These consequences generate requirements primarily for the VIRTE environment. Consequences manifested in opponent reactions depend on the autonomous behavior and performance of the CGF opponents as well as the number and location of the opponents. We have  created scenes and derived CGF requirements primarily from these consequences. Ideally, an instructor could moderate the severity of these consequences by adjusting the performance and placement of the opponents.  Finally, forced coincidences are artificially controlled by the training system. The instructor should be able to control how prevalent forced negative coincidence is during a training scenario. Whether or not trainees are informed of their opponents characteristics or the degree of forced coincidence is at the instructor’s discretion.Earlier efforts at developing training scenarios for Demo II attempted to define extended scenarios that could encompass several training objectives.  However, because simulation-based virtual environments such as VIRTE enable free-play on the part of trainees and (autonomous) threat forces, the events in the scenario become more and more difficult to predict as the scenario progresses.  It is difficult to construct a scenario that will meet given training objectives in the later parts of the scenario.  It is more feasible to create opportunities to teach specific lessons by creating separate, short duration “scenes.” A scene is intended to be a particular configuration of rooms, walls, objects, doors, windows, and threats (which have certain scripted or autonomous behaviors and reactions), plus a specific task for the trainee to perform.  Thus this requirements analysis produces only brief scenes rather than extended scenarios.  Section  REF _Ref45553893 \n 0 discusses this limitation of our approach.Analyzing Clear-Room RequirementsThe training objectives we have considered so far were taken from course notes for a USMC building clearing course  ADDIN EN.CITE <EndNote><Cite><Author>Marine Corps Warfighting Lab</Author><Year>2002</Year><RecNum>2</RecNum><MDL><REFERENCE_TYPE>10</REFERENCE_TYPE><AUTHORS><AUTHOR>Marine Corps Warfighting Lab,</AUTHOR></AUTHORS><YEAR>2002</YEAR><TITLE>Squad and Individual Building Clearing Techniques: Instructor Outline</TITLE><PUBLISHER>United States Marine Corps</PUBLISHER><KEYWORDS><KEYWORD>MOUT</KEYWORD></KEYWORDS><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>Quantico, Virginia 22134-5096</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></MDL></Cite></EndNote>[7].  In this section we present an example of how the requirements definition process is applied to a subset of these objectives.  This subset concerns the fire team room clearing task.  The objectives are as follows:Recall the proper way to organize the rifle squad for building/room clearing actions.Know the factors in choosing the proper technique for clearing a roomKnow the seven advantages for conducting a multiple (man) entryKnow the least preferred method of clearing a roomKnow and demonstrate the two different positions for preparing to enter a roomKnow the proper technique to breach a doorKnow the four methods for crossing the thresholdKnow the 1, 2, 3, and 4 man clearing techniquesDemonstrate the steps for clearing a room through an open doorwayTasks Required by Training ObjectivesThe training objectives above indicate that room clearing involves a planning phase and an execution phase.  In the planning phase, the Marine (team leader) has to make the following decisions:How many men should clear the room.  (1, 2, 3, or 4)What order the men should enter the room (choices from rifleman, assistant SAW, SAW, and team leader)Where the men should stack outside the room (split or stacked positions)How the door should be breached, if one is present and closed (demolition, ram, shotgun, munitions, or kick)What kind of grenade will be used, if any (none, fragmentary, stun)How the clearing men will move across the threshold and into the room (buttonhook, cross, limited penetration, or straight entry; left or right for each man)After these decisions are made, the Marines must execute the room clearing task—move to stacking positions, breach the door, employ a grenade, cross the threshold and move into the room to points of domination. Factors for Making DecisionsThe planning tasks require making decisions based on the current situation.  REF _Ref48559449  \* MERGEFORMAT Table 1 shows what factors in the situation are relevant and how they affect each decision. Penalties for Not Performing Tasks CorrectlyExecution of the room clearing tasks must be done properly to avoid excess risk.

We present here example scenes to exercise three tasks—two decision tasks, and one action task.Decide Number of MenThe first two factors in  are not dependent on the environment, but on the scenario set up by the trainer.  The other two, room size and hallway configuration, can be set up in scenes. Scenes 1, 2, and 3 below show different sized rooms and the cues needed by the Marines to recognize the size factor.  These scenes present a normal room requiring four men, indicated by the door swinging into the room; a closet, indicated by the door swinging into the team’s room; and another closet without a door that would be identified by seeing the back wall before entry.  In Scene 1, the target room would have hostiles in it and doors to secure, making it difficult for two men to clear successfully.  Scenes 2 and 3 do not need hostile entities in them, although they may be added. EMBED Word.Picture.8  Scene 1.  Baseline room clearing.  Identify room to clear as large room because door opens into it.  Closed door allows split start positions. EMBED Word.Picture.8  Scene 3. Identify room to clear as closet because back wall is visible.Decide Entry PositionsScene 4 is Scene 1 without the door present and with the hostiles positioned to be able to engage the clearing team only if the team passes in front of the door.  This scene can be used with Scene 1 to highlight this factor. EMBED Word.Picture.8  Scene 2. Identify room to clear as closet because door opens out.Take Entry PositionAny of the scenes described above can be used to exercise this task.  In any scene with threats in the room observing the door, improper positioning by the lead trainee so that he or his weapon is visible from inside the room would allow the threats to be alerted and even to shoot at the lead trainee. EMBED Word.Picture.8  Scene 4. Open doorway, and hostiles positioned to engage team members who attempt to move to positions across doorwayIn cases where the combatants can shoot through walls, threats in the room could shoot towards all of the trainees if they were alerted.  Any of the scenes with threats could be used with soft wall materials to present this situation.  The threat behavior would be to shoot at the wall near the door if they heard or saw anything from the other room.Finally, checking for booby traps is part of this task, so any of the scenes above could be used, without CGF threats but with an explosive booby trap in the doorway.CGF RequirementsScene 1 above has CGF threats in it.  To provide consequences for decisions about how many Marines enter the room, the threats must basically be able to detect and engage the Marines.  Physical factors—acquisition delays, engagement delays, hit probabilities—should not be super-humanly good, but should be good enough that the threats have a significant chance of shooting a Marine if not enough enter the room quickly enough.  If threats are placed in scenes 2 and 3, similar requirements would be necessary for them.  Note that other actions in the room clearing task not illustrated here—such as employing a grenade—would place additional requirements on CGF behavior (stun effects). Scene 4 requires that the CGF threats provide undesirable consequences if the Marines decide to use stacking positions on both sides of the doorway.  The threats in this case must be able to detect Marines crossing the doorway to get in position—a slightly different acquisition capability than detecting Marines coming through the door.  They must also be able to engage the Marines quickly while they are exposed.The consequences of poorly executing the take-entry-position task are exposure in the doorway, giving away the team’s position, and entering the room poorly.  The latter problem is highlighted by threats in the room engaging the Marines, as above.  Exposure in the doorway requires that the CGF threats can detect the Marine by just the portion of his body or weapon that is visible in the doorway.  The CGF must then be able to engage the Marine, either shooting at the visible part or shooting through the wall if applicable. To detect noisy Marines, the CGF threat must be able to detect with sound;  the CGF must then be alerted and react more quickly to a subsequent room entry.Summary and ConclusionsWe have presented a process for defining design requirements for components of a VE training system that is based on system training objectives.  The process was illustrated for a CGF component in a CQB domain.  The process includes identifying the decision making and skill execution components of the tasks to be trained; identifying factors in situations that affect the decisions and executions; defining consequences of incorrect decisions and poor skill executions; creating scenes that present different factors to the trainees; and identifying component requirements that allow those scenes to be implemented.The objectives we have obtained from Marine Corps training materials seem to be incomplete in that they do not cover a very broad range of situations that could occur during building clearing.  In general, they focus on offensive actions that are expected to be planned and executed successfully.  There are no objectives for temporary defensive measures when the threat forces get the upper hand, when the situation (room or threats) surprises the trainees,  when the threats engage the trainees in a hallway, or when the trainees make a mistake.  There are no objectives for dealing with casualties.

These kinds of objectives will be considered in the future.Finally, the requirements analysis we have presented could be expanded to derive requirements for aspects of the VE other than CGF, such as display resolution and user interface. Further, the analysis could derive requirements from training strategies and other training objectives in the training transfer framework.References QUOTE EN.REFLIST [1]	L. L. Worcester and P. J.

DOUGLAS REECE is a Senior Scientist at SAIC in Orlando. He has been developing physical and behavioral models for individual combatant CGFs for the past six years. He is currently the software architect for DISAF projects; previously, he was the principal investigator for Computer Controlled Hostiles for the Marine Corps’ Team Target Engagement Simulator. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University in 1992.LT JOSEPH COHN, PH. D. is a designated Aerospace Psychologist and is the Lead, Requirements and Training for VE at the Naval Research Laboratory.  He is currently developing a paradigm for using posture and orientation as an for probing the underlying cognitive state. Previously LT Cohn was the Lead, Training Effectiveness Evaluation at the Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division. While at NAWCTSD he developed a novel approach for incorporating human centered design approaches into Virtual Environment simulation development and directed the simulator sickness evaluation effort. LT Cohn also co-developed time series analysis technique for evaluating the degree to which VE training enhances real world performance. LT Cohn received his PhD in Neuroscience from Brandeis University’s Ashton Graybiel Spatial Orientation Laboratory. DR. JAMES TEMPLEMAN is Chief Scientist of VIRTE Demo II and Section Head of Immersive Simulation (Code 5511) at NRL.  His group designs, implements, and tests new interaction techniques for fully immersive virtual environments.  He invented Gaiter, a virtual locomotion control in which the user walks in place to walk through VE.  He received his D.Sc. in Computer Science from George Washington University in 1992.ba
