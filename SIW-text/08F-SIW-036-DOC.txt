DoDAF Use In MATREXSidney N. Antommarchi HYPERLINK "mailto:santom@d-a-s.com" santom@d-a-s.com Dynamic Animation Systems, Inc.12015 Lee Jackson Highway, Suite 200Fairfax, VA 22033Keywords:Department of Defense (DoD) Architecture Framework (DoDAF), Modeling Architecture for Technology, Research, and Experimentation (MATREX), Modeling & Simulation, Distributed Simulation, Simulation Based Acquisition (SBA)Abstract: The DoDAF establishes a guide for the development of architectures. DoDAF guide implementation has many dependencies on the organization doing the implementation. Cost, schedule, and resources need to be considered in answering what, how much, and the roadmap of implementation. It is also important to consider the how DoDAF is used in M&S development.  This paper discusses the Real-World Problem Domain (i.e. Military Problem Domain) and the Simulation Problem Domain to provide context for the use of DoDAF.  This paper also details the use of DoDAF in the MATREX program and provides lessons learned for the benefit of the DoD SBA community.  Specifically, this paper describes which DoDAF views, view products, and view product schemas are used and why they are used by the MATREX program in its architecture efforts.  Also, tools used for view product documentation are detailed.  In addition, this paper details phased evolution plans for DoDAF use in the MATREX program.1. IntroductionThis paper will introduce the sub-set of DoDAF [1] views and view products used in the MATREX program.  Also, the M&S Problem Domain will be defined and DoDAF views are used within its context.In addition, this paper will introduce the MATREX Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which was selected for DoDAF view product implementation.  The view products implemented by MATREX will be listed and the schema for each view product is described along with rationale and lessons learned where appropriate.  Finally, future implementation plans for additional views will be described.2. DoDAFThe MATREX program uses the “DoD Architecture Framework (DoDAF)” [1] which establishes a guide for the development of architectures.  DoDAF introduces the concept of views for architecture development and defines the following:Operational View (OV) - The OV captures the operational nodes, the tasks or activities performed, and the information that must be exchanged to accomplish DoD missionsSystem View (SV) - The SV captures system, service, and interconnection functionality providing for, or supporting, operational activitiesTechnical Standards Views (TV) - The TV is the minimal set of rules governing the arrangement, interaction, and interdependence of system parts or elementsAll View (AV) - There are some overarching aspects of architecture that relate to all three views (i.e. OV, SV, and TV). These overarching aspects are captured in the AV products.Although there are many DoDAF view products (i.e. Architectural Artifacts (AA)), this paper only makes reference to the following view products:Overview and Summary Information (AV-1) – Scope, purpose, intended users, environment depicted, analytical findingsIntegrated Dictionary (AV-2) – Architecture data repository with definitions of all terms used in all productsHigh-Level Operational Concept Graphic (OV-1) – High-level graphical/textual description of operational conceptOperational Node Connectivity Description (OV-2) – Operational nodes, connectivity, and information exchange need lines between nodesOperational Activity Model (OV-5) – Details capabilities, operational activities, relationships among activities, inputs, and outputs; overlays can show cost, performing nodes, or other pertinent informationOperational Rules Model (OV-6a) – One of three products used to describe operational activity—identifies business rules that constrain operationOperational State Transition Description (OV-6b) – One of three products used to describe operational activity—identifies business process responses to eventsOperational Event-Trace Description (OV-6c)  –  One of three products used to describe operational activity—traces actions in a scenario or sequence of eventsSystems Functionality Description (SV-4a) – Functions performed by systems and the system data flows among system functionsOperational Activity to Systems Function Traceability Matrix (SV-5a) – Mapping of system functions back to operational activitiesSystems/Services Rules Model Services Rules Model (SV-10a) – One of three products used to describe system and service functionality—identifies constraints that are imposed on systems/services functionality due to some aspect of systems design or implementationSystems/Services  State Transition Description (SV-10b) – One of three products used to describe system and service functionality—identifies responses of a system/service to eventsSystems/Services Event-Trace Description (SV-10c) – One of three products used to describe system or service functionality—identifies system/service-specific refinements of critical sequences of events described in the Operational ViewTechnical Standards Profile (TV-1) – Listing of standards that apply to Systems and ServicesTechnical Standards Forecast (TV-2) – Description of emerging standards and potential impact on current Systems and Services View elements, within a set of time frames.3. M&S Problem DomainThe M&S Problem Domain for an M&S program like MATREX decomposes into its Real-World Problem Domain (RWPD) and Simulation Problem Domain (SPD) components, as depicted by Figure 1.Figure 1 M&S Problem DomainIn MATREX, the RWPD descries the military operations and equipment that may selected for modeling.  For example, a tank platoon that needs to maneuver thru a battlefield and overrun an enemy stronghold.On the other hand, the SPD describes the operational aspects of a collection of models within the context of an event and/or experiment.  For example, the simulation environment that needs to have MMI interfaces for an event player in a Human-In-The-Loop workstation to effect the simulation.In addition to the RWPD and SPD, the Simulation Environment Baseline (SEB) details the capabilities of the MATREX products, i.e. MATREX Reference Implementation (RI) and Tools.  Both the MATREX RI is composed of individual components.  The RWPD, SPD, and SEB are further defined in the following sub-sections.3.1 Real-World Problem Domain (RPWD)The RPWD refers to aspects of the real world that simulation environment capabilities need to emulate at a particular fidelity in order to address a particular purpose.  It describes the type of real-world operational capabilities that models or simulators must represent as well as the doctrinal missions for each capability that MATREX users/customers want represented.  It also describes the operational environment where the capabilities are deployed and operated.  The RWPD is also known as the Military Problem Domain in DoD circles.3.2 SPDThe SPD Refers to the simulation environment concept needed to emulate the Real-World Problem Domain, provide support facilities and infrastructure, and respond to non-functional directives.3.3 SEBThe SEB constitutes the set of current, available, and mature MATREX M&S technologies that may be configured to satisfy the Simulation Problem Domain associated with a set of Specific Intended Uses (SIUs), i.e. Measure of Effectiveness (MoE) and Measures of Performance (MoP).  It should be noted that the SEB represents capabilities being/already developed.4. ImplementationThe MATREX program has endeavored to implement separate DoDAF views for each of the RWPD, SPD, and SEB.  Implemented DoDAF views are common to both the RWPD and SPD unless otherwise specified.  The implementation infrastructure as well as the schema used for each of the DoDAF views is detailed in the following subsections.  Figure 2 shows a UML summary of the current MATREX implementation of DoDAF views.Figure 2 MATREX DoDAF Implementation UML Context4.1 IDEDrupal ( HYPERLINK "http://drupal.org/" http://drupal.org/) is a content management platform based on MySQL, Apache, PHP, and other components. The MATREX extensions to Drupal are collectively known as IDE.  IDE serves as a MATREX’s knowledge repository.  IDE content is accessible (i.e. create, edit, or browse content) from various standards based browsers, see Figure 3.Figure 3 IDE Main PageIt should be noted that Drupal is an excellent selection for any small/medium size M&S programs since its licensing falls under the GNU General Public License.  Tools considered but not selected by the MATREX program include Telelogic Systems Architect® and IBM’s Rational® Rose.  Although these tools offer excellent functionality, Drupal/IDE is a low cost alternative that allows a high level of customization.4.1 AV-1Although there is no specific MATREX IDE implementation of the AV-1, all the information associated with the AV-1 can be found in the following MATREX documents: Strategic Plan [8], Tactical Plan [9], and Fiscal Year Plan [10].4.2 AV-2The MATREX AV-2 has the following schema:Acronym/Term – Text FieldDetail/Acronym Expansion – Text FieldAuthoritative Source – Text FieldUsed in Architecture – Yes/NoUniversal Resource Locators  (URLs) – List of URLsNotes – Text FieldRevision – Date & Time StampWhenever possible, all MATREX AV-2 entries contain authoritative references with web URLs to prevent acronym/term overloading.  Also, the MATREX AV-2 entries are used for the program in general in addition to architecture definition.  It should be noted that the AV-2 schema and data can be exported to a variety of formats including Coma Separated Values (CSV).  The MATREX AV-2 in IDE can be seen in Figure 4.Figure 4 MATREX IDE AV-24.3 OV-2MATREX does not implement the OV-2.  However, it is expected that a Force Structure, i.e. Horse Blanket, be available as input from users/customers when decomposition for the RWPD is done.4.4 OV-5The MATREX RWPD OV-5 has the following schema:OV-5 ID – URL to an AV-2 entryNode – Yes/NoActivity – Yes/NoArmy Universal Task List (AUTL) [4] ID – N.[N]Universal Joint Task List (UJTL) ID [5] – N.[N]Notes – Text FieldRevision – Date & Time StampWhenever possible, all MATREX RWPD OV-5 entries are associated with an “AUTL ID” and/or “UJTL ID”.  This association is relatively easy to ascertain and eliminates ambiguity for an Activity.  The “N.[N]” in the “AUTL ID” and “UJTL ID” fields represents a Regular Expression, e.g. “5.5.5”.  It should be noted that future fighting force activities may not be map to an “AUTL ID” and/or “UJTL ID”.  The MATREX OV-5 in IDE can be seen in Figure 5.Figure 5 MATREX IDE RWPD OV-5The MATREX SPD OV-5 has the following schema:OV-5 ID – URL to an AV-2 entryNode – Yes/NoActivity – Yes/NoNotes – Text FieldRevision – Date & Time StampSPD OV-5 Activities/Nodes are associated with the Federation Development and Execution Process (FEDEP) process [2] and/or generally with event/exercise specific activities, e.g. FEDEP Step 6 Execute Federation and Prepare Results Activity 6.1 Execute Federation.  The MATREX SPD OV-5 in IDE can be seen in Figure 6.In the MATREX program, the RWPD OV-5 depicts military operations nodes and activities and the SPD OV-5 depicts event/exercise operations nodes and activities.  The combination of the RWPD OV-5 and SPD OV-5 are functionally decomposed in the SPD SV-4a, see Section 4.6 below.Figure 6 MATREX IDE SPD OV-54.5 OV-6cThe MATREX RWPD OV-6c has the following schema:Sequence Id – URL to an AV-2 entryThread Name – URL to an AV-2 entryStep – Text FieldFrom Node – URL to an SV-5 EntryTo Node – URL to an SV-5 EntryActivity – URL to an SV-5 EntryForce Structure – Text FieldMan-Machine Interface (MMI) – Yes/NoMind Process – Yes/NoNotes – Text FieldRevision – Date & Time StampThe “Force Structure” field depicts the name of an element where an activity takes place.  The “MMI” field documents when a human actor is interfacing with a machine.  The “Mind Process” field documents when a human process like thinking is extant.  The MATREX RWPD OV-6c in IDE can be seen in Figure 7.Figure 7 MATREX RWPD IDE OV-6cIDE also has the capability of being able to display a sequence diagram of the RWPD OV-6c as can be seen in Figure 8.Figure 8 MATREX IDE RWPD OV-6c Sequence DiagramAlthough the SPD OV-6c is similar in content than the RWPD OV-6c, there are some notable differences in the way that information filtering works as can be seen in Figure 9.  Currently the SPD OV-6c does not support sequence diagrams unlike the RWPD OV-6c.  However, this capability is slated for development and will be reused from the RWPD OV-6c.Figure 9 MATREX IDE SPD OV-6c4.6 SV-4aThe MATREX RWPD SV-4a has the following schema:SV-4a Name – URL to an AV-2 entryNotes – Text FieldRevision – Date & Time StampIn essence, functional decomposition at the RWPD level is not needed in great detail.  It is sufficient to have functional categories instead for generalized understanding when problem decomposition starts.  On the other hand, the SPD level does need much more detail. The MATREX RWPD OV-6c in IDE can be seen in Figure 10.Figure 10 MATREX IDE RWPD SV-4aThe MATREX SPD SV-4a has the following schema:ID – N.[N]Is Hierarchy Node – Yes=Branch /No=LeafSV-4a Name – URL to an AV-2 entryCross Command Collaboration (3CE) SV-4 Deviation  – Yes/NoSEB  – Yes/NoComponents – List of MATREX RI components realizing the functionNotes – Text FieldRevision – Date & Time StampThe “N.[N]” in the “ID” field represents a Regular Expression [6], e.g. “1.1.2.2.1”.  The “Is Hierarchy Node” represents a determination of whether a node is a branch or a leaf in the functional decomposition hierarchical tree of the SPD SV-4.  This determination is important to make since it is usually expected that branches contain no more function than that specified by its subordinate leafs.  This expectation eliminates much confusion with respect to what node of the tree represents what function.Both the MATREX and the 3CE SV-4a originated at the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC).  The “3CE SV-4 Deviation” field tracks MATREX deviations from the 3CE SV-4a.  The MATREX SPD SV-4a in IDE can be seen in Figure 11.As can be seen, the SPD SV-4a has significantly more detail than the RWPD SV-4 and this detail is used to conduct Capability Gap Analysis (CGA) [3].Figure 11 MATREX IDE SPD SV-4aThe MATREX SEB SV-4a has the following schema:Title - Text FieldDescription - Text FieldParent - URL To Parent FunctionRevision – Date & Time StampIt should be noted that the SEB SV-4a schema shown here contains additional fields not relevant to DoDAF.4.7 SV-5aThe MATREX SV-5a has the following schema:OV-5 – URL to OV-5 entrySV-4 – List of URLs to SV-4a entryNotes – Text FieldIt should be noted that this schema allows a mapping between one OV-5 item and multiple SV-4 items, i.e. a “one-to-many” map.  The “SV-4” field has cardinality grater than one.  This means that an activity/node is decomposed into one or several functions.  The MATREX SV-5a in IDE can be seen in Figure 12.Figure 12 MATREX IDE SV-5aThe MATREX SV-5a allows the RPWD OV-5 to be mapped to the SPD SV-4a and the SPD OV-5 to the SPD SV-4a.  In this fashion, all the military operational activities and nodes and event/exercise operational activities and nodes are traced to SPD SV-4a items, i.e. SPD functions.4.8 SV-10cThe MATREX SEB SV-10c has the following schema:Sequence Number - IntegerEvent – Text FieldType – EnumerationMessage – Collection of FieldsSource Function – URLDestination Function – URLStereotype – URLRevision – Date & Time StampAlthough the “Message” field has not been completely detailed in this paper because of its complexity and for expediency, it should be noted that its actual definition is such that a High Level Architecture (HLA) Federation Object Model (FOM) can be generated from it.  The MATREX SEB SV-10c sequence diagram in IDE can be seen in Figure 13.Figure 13 MATREX SEB SV-10c Sequence Diagram4.9 TV-1The MATREX TV-1 has the following schema:Standard ID – Text FieldStandard Name – Text FieldDescription – Text FieldAuthoring Organization – Text FieldLink to Standard – URLRelated Link – URLVersion – Text FieldVersion Date – Text FieldDoD Information Technology Standards Registry (DISR) Service Area – Text FieldComponents – List of MATREX RI ComponentsNotes – Text FieldCM Version – Enumeration of MATREX RI/Tools VersionsRevision – Date & Time StampDISRonline [7] contains all information associated with the “DISR Service Area” field.  In essence, the “DISR Service Area” links in the MATREX TV-1 to DoD level standards activities.  The “CM Version” field links a TV-1 to a particular MATREX RI and/or Tools.  The MATREX TV-1 in IDE can be seen in Figure 14.Figure 14 MATREX IDE TV-14.10 RWPD-SPD and SPD-SEB MapsThe RWPD and SPD are mapped to each other via the RWPD OV-5 to SPD SV-4a.  A single RWPD OV-5 item is mapped to multiple SPD SV-4a items.  In this fashion, all military activities trace to simulation functionality.   RWPD to SPD mapping can be seen in Figure 15.Figure 15 MATREX IDE RPWD to SPD MappingThe SPD and functional requirements to be developed are mapped to each other via the SPD SV-4a and the System Requirements Specification (SRS) requirements.  A single SPD SV-4a item is mapped to a single SRS requirement and associated to a TV-1 item.  In this fashion, The MATREX SPD to functional requirements mapping in IDE can be seen in Figure 16.  Both the RWPD-SPD and SPD-SEB mappings provide traceability.Figure 16 MATREX IDE SPD to Functional Requirement Mapping5. Future WorkThe MATREX program will endeavor to implement the following views in coming years:RWPD/SPD OV-1RWPD/SPD OV-6aRWPD/SPD OV-6bSPD SV-10aSPD SV-10bTV-2In addition, the SEB SV-10c is being evolved to be able to semi-automatically generate unit/scenario HLA test cases using the MATREX Advanced Testing Capability (ATC) tool.6. ConclusionThis paper discussed the RPWD and SPD as well as the SEB concept used in the MATREX program.  In addition, the RPWD, SPD, and SEB DoDAF view products and their respective schemas where introduced.  Finally, this paper detailed evolution plans for DoDAF use.  The MATREX program experience with DoDAF use can be of significant benefit for other M&S programs/projects associated with DoD SBA.7.
