IO-ISR ForumChairDonald StonerVice ChairLouis FordSecretaryDavid AcevedoObjectives for this Workshop:Increase attendance at the forum session due to conference location and its proximity to multiple intelligence centers.Discuss areas of concern for intelligence operations in Modeling and Simulation.Discuss the worth of continuing with this forum or collapsing it back into C4I.Comments and Recommendations:I had several authors complain about having to make multiple presentations.  One of them had to leave from our presentation and go directly to another forum session to present again.  We need to make a greater effort to reduce multiple presentations and to coordinate presentations for the author’s convenience.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)15Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)22Peak attendance (including joint sessions)25Total papers presented4“No-show” presentations1Other presentations and panel discussions0Recommended Reading List nominations (including previous nominations):04S-SIW-00404S-SIW-119
