Join in the Conference Committee’s “intersection of domains” initiative with potential to address reducing uncertainty and ambiguity in early development to reduce unplanned changes and mistakes2  Focus efforts on interoperability of distributed simulation for Space considering unforgiving environment, time, distance, human fragility and need for everything to work together3 Through international activity begun at Euro/SIW and with UAH continue to develop WIKI for inclusive definitions of terms Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)24Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)32Peak attendance (including joint sessions)NATotal papers presented4“No-show” presentationsOther presentations and panel discussions4Recommended Reading List nomination:  #114                 2007 FALL SIW OUTBRIEF FORM
