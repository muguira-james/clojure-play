Name of Forum or Group:  RD&EChairCynthia BallardVice ChairCharles CohenSecretaryJohn FayObjectives for this Workshop:Identify one government or academia volunteer to fill one of the two RDE vacancies.Concentrate focus on RDE User Community by special presentations by LVC SG and DIS PDG.  Both of these groups were voted ‘high interest’ by the RDE User Community.Promote Joint Sessions to reduce Paper Presentations (ANL, CMSS).Brief all pertinent information (Agenda Format, Upcoming Elections, Upcoming Fall SIW Theme and Format) and meet F2F with PRP Members to kick-off the day.Comments and Recommendations:Comments:Our invited talk on LVC Architecture was cancelled due to the author having a family emergency. However, that was the talk that had the largest audience (61 present, and the next highest was 45).  I hope that this talk is invited again, as obviously people want to learn about this.Recommendations:Involve RDE User Community via reflector for Call for Papers to focus abstracts.Continue to post all accepted paper abstracts on reflector.Continue to publish schedule for PRP members for abstract and paper review.RDE PRP will AGAIN utilize the RDE reflector to solicit the following engineering research survey papers:Business Cases for utilizing SISO Policies and Procedures.Availability of DIS, HLA, and TENA tools including GFE, Commercial, and International tools and products.  At least three commercial vendors must be investigated along with all services (USAF, USMC, USN, US Army, and JFCOM).RDE PRP will highlight pertinent PDGs, PSGs, and SGs via the RDE reflector.  In addition, RDE PRP will present pertinent group(s) accomplishments and agendas for current workshop at the next RDE PRP F2F meeting.Some authors believed that the papers would be available before the conference for people to read, and assumed that their papers were read. Therefore, we should either 1) make those papers available before the conference, or 2) make it clear to the authors that the papers are not available until after the conference.  Additionally, promote the CD that is for sale before the conference.Three 2007 SIWzie presented in RDE (069, 076, 094).For the SIWzie, we recommend:  07F-SIW-076 Enhancing Virtual Simulation Systems Interoperability through V-DIS.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)38Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)61Peak attendance (including joint sessions)61Total papers presented9“No-show” presentations1Other presentations and panel discussions2Recommended Reading List nomination: 07F-SIW-076 Enhancing Virtual Simulation Systems Interoperability through V-DIS07F-SIW-069 Making Your BOMs and FOM Modules Play Together                 2007 FALL SIW OUTBRIEF FORM
