SENS Meeting - MinutesThere were 8 papers presented as either SENS Joint or SENS. Papers and somepresentations may be downloaded from the web http://www.sisostds.org/siw/99springStandards Nominations Discussion with SNE:         Spatial Reference Model         Data Coding Standard    See 99S-SIW-011        Conceptual Reference Model   See 98F-SIW-018        EO/IR Data DictionaryOn all of these nominations, a brief presentation was made and some discussionensued. Most of these items are documented under SEDRIS, seehttp://www.sedris.org  The next step is to sign up volunteers to continue thestandards development.--- Presentations ----99S-SIW-034 Data Alignment between Army C4I Databases and Army Simulations Presented Wednesday Afternoon, Joint C4I/SENS Michael R. Hieb Ph.D. Points: Notes that a key issue for interoperability of C4I systems andsimulations is a lack of common standards for interfaces and data elementrepresentation. Advocates incorporation of C4I data models (JCDB specifically)into future simulation.99S-SIW-086 Radiometric Validation of the Cloud Scene Simulation Model Presented Thursday Morning, Joint SNE/SENS Dr. Joel B. Mozer Ph.D. Points: Comparison of model results to real world and modification of model parameters to better match real world.99S-SIW-088 Space Environment Models for Acquisition, Operations, and M&S Presented Thursday Morning, Joint SNE/SENS Gregory P. Ginet Points: Good description of available space models, any why they are used.NOMINATED FOR RECOMMENDED READING LIST99S-SIW-092 Resource Access and Sharing thru SEDRIS Will not be specifically presented. There will be an evening SEDRIS session. This paper will be published. Paul Gilbert Foley99S-SIW-101 TAOS in Space Presented Thursday Morning Joint SNE/SENS Robert A Reynolds Points: Description of new work incorporating Ionospheric Models into TAOS.99S-SIW-117 The Utility of Cluster Analysis for Improving the Use of Higher-Fidelity Sensor Models in Advanced Simulations Presented Thursday Afternoon SENS Mr. Michael D.Mandelberg Points: Outline cluster methods to maintain fidelity while running a complex physics based model.99S-SIW-152 Generalized Environmental Abstractions (GEAs) of Acoustic Transmission Loss to Support Synthetic Force Development Presented Thursday Morning, Joint SNE/SENS Mr. Albert C.
