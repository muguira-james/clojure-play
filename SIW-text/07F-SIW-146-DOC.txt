Comments from 07F-SIW-023, “Effects of long-haul network connectivity on the visual fidelity of real-time flight simulations” (21 attendees):The Applied Visual Research Team at Mesa Research Site (MRS) has conducted a set of experiments to determine and categorize the visual artifacts caused by network transport delay in a distributed simulation environment.  “What are the visual anomalies caused by interconnecting high speed flight simulators over a long-haul network?”“What is the actual position error caused by the network delays?”Conclusions of Experiment One using a dedicated networkA high number of visual anomalies occur on a dedicated network without additional congestionAdding network congestion has no effect until a certain “max” loading level Adding network congestion to a complicated flight differs from a simple flight pathConclusions of Experiment Two designed to investigate actual errors in position and velocityVisual scene may look good but position error maybe largeNetwork jitter is the main source of visual anomaliesRecommendation:This work has implications for LVC, Weapons, Radar simulation 2.

Comments from 07F-SIW-057, “Using BOM in Development Of Distributed Simulation Projects” (20 Attendees):Main factors in federation development are:Unique characteristics of the projectResourcesDeadlinesReusability decisionsInteroperability constraintsMain Objectives to Conceptual Modeling with BOMForming the Conceptual ModelForming the FOM of the federationForming the SOM of the federatesMain StepsUse case scenariosPattern of interplays and their tableBOM-FOM diagramsBOM-SOM diagramsConclusions:Conceptual modeling is a critical process for covering all of the user requirements while forming a framework to be used in verifying and validating the systemFederation development process achieves great improvement by utilizing Use Cases and BOM in the conceptual modelBOMs are very effective to gather the information that will be the parts of FOM and SOMs.  BOM-FOM and BOM-SOM diagrams can be improved to include additional information6. Comments from 07F-SIW-075, “NATO and NATO/PfP Nations HLA Compliance Certification: History, Lessons Learned and Proposed Enhancements” (Joint Session with CFI forum:  33 attendees):NATO MSG-050 tasked to provide oversight on and coordinate HLA Compliance Certification activityHLA Compliance testing and certification not considered mandatory by NATOConsidered a normal step on the way to technical interoperability of simulationsOutside the US, HLA certification is now available in France, Spain and, Sweden, coming soon in Canada and UKRecommendation:HLA federate developers and government organizations should continue to take advantage of compliance certification7. Comments from 07F-SIW-069, “Making Your BOMs and FOM Modules Play Together” (Joint Session with CFI forum: 29 attendees):Simulations are always based on models of an actual or anticipated realityThe time and effort required to develop and good and relevant model should not be underestimatedDifferent types of models are used over the life-cycle of modeling activityThe likelihood of reusing a model increases if the model has been described in a standard format and using standardized building blocksThe HLA FOM format and BOM format have been standardizedBOM and FOM modules can be used collectively to facilitate reuse and help expedite development of HLA federates and federationsRecommendations:Use BOMs as a means to document the conceptual model aspects (patterns, states, entities, and events) of HLA (or TENA) object modelsUse BOMs to foster development of FOM module building blocks to expedite the creation of HLA federates and federations8. Comments from 07F-SIW-044, “A Proposed Open System Architecture for Modeling and Simulation (OSAMS)” (Joint Session with CFI forum:  39 attendees):M&S provided a cost effective way (and sometimes the only way) to support many challenging requirementsCurrent interoperability standards allow simulations to interoperate; however, there are no standards for how to build modelsModels should be built not simulationsOpen System Architecture for Modeling and Simulation provides standards fro how to build highly interoperable modelsSuggesting new study group named Open Source Initiative for Parallel and Distributed Modeling and Simulation (OSI-PDMS)Re-define terms such as “models” and “simulations” using software perspectiveFive desirable features for OSAMSHierarchical composition structureStandardized modeling frameworkAbstract polymorphic interfacesDistributed object capabilitiesData logging interfaces and merged trace file generationConclusions:OpenMSA and OSAMS are strongly needed standards that will significantly lower the cost of the M&S in the long runAdvantages-lower cost of model development, VV&A, scenario generation, operation of simulation, and post processingBetter performance without compromising fidelity by composing tightly integrated, yet decoupled, models together into a single executing processsNext-generation capabilities can be achieved without throwing away investmentsMulticore computing is on the way.  OpenMSA and OSAMS support multicore computing.9. Comments from 07F-SIW-083, “Advancing the FEDEP for Simulation Based Acquisition” Conclusions:Program-level processes focus on cost, schedule, and risk.From the SoS perspective, the federation (and the FEDEP) are test tools.The FEDEP is focused on the technical aspects of producing a federation.We’re working to provide the hooks into the FEDEP to allow the technical and programmatic processes to align.We provided several more comments against the FEDEP that will go into the next comment round.10. Comments from 07F-SIW-010, “Marine Advanced Unit, Infantry (MAUI) Study)” The objective of this study is to develop and analyze Marine Corps infantry squad M&S baseline scenarios using the agent-based Infantry Warrior Simulation (IWARS) created by the Anteon Corporation and the Army’s Natick Soldier Center.Paper addresses the development effort for the first baseline infantry scenario identified as COIN, a counterinsurgency scenario and identified the methodology used in the study as Equipment Quantifying Usage Impact Process (EQUIP).The study team defined an Infantry Scenario Development Process.  Having a process in place provided the team a mechanism for producing efficient and high quality scenarios.A MAUI Analysis Methodology was developed.  Comparative analysis confirmed this squad simulation can provide an analystic baseline that facilitates the analysis of the impact of changing squad equipment, TTPS or organization to include relative measure of increase or decrease in lethality, survivability and sustainability.Study Team Recognizes the need for a Baseline Infantry Scenario Repository promoting the reuse of existing scenarios when applicable vice building all scenarios from scratch.Conclusions:MAUI COIN metrics can be measured.COIN metrics can provide meaningful evaluations of squad equipment, Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs), and organization.MAUI COIN Comparison results provide a quantitative measure of the degree of improvement or deterioration from the baseline.Final Forum Recommendation:  The DSPT forum recommends that the EXCOM consider establishing a repository for orphaned freeware tools such as those originally developed by DMSO for the HLA (i.e. Federation Execution Planner’s Workbook, Federation Verification Tool, Federation Management Tool).   In addition, the repository could hold freeware tools from current developers, if they choose to release them to SISO.  The DSPT forum will sponsor the repository.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)21.67Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)22Peak attendance (including joint sessions)40Total papers presented8“No-show” presentations0Other presentations and panel discussions02 cancelled pre-conference via IST support messaging.Recommended Reading List nomination: 07F-SIW-12                 2007 FALL SIW OUTBRIEF FORM
