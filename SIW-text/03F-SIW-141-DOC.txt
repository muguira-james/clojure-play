Simulation specifically needed to support development and analysis of Joint Concepts (JOPSC, JOC, JFC) and Integrated Architecture (IA).Simulation Of Multi Player Enterprises (Government and Commercial): Multi Agency, Global Distributed Enterprises, Supply Chains, Trading Networks)Development Of New Simulation Techniques And TechnologyRapid Collaborative Simulation EnvironmentsLinking Legacy And COTS SimulationsLinking COTS ToolsComments and Recommendations:Enterprise Simulation is similar to logistics simulation. Trend is toward multi player enterprises, typically with dynamic systems, making simulation attractive for analysis, engineering, and tuning.Wide recognition that distributed process simulations are increasingly needed in complex enterprises. Three papers and panel discussion identified two broad approaches:Standardized COTS Simulation Interoperability, achieved through a standardized federated approach (focus on HLA-CSPIF effort).Standardized Distributed Collaborative Environments (focus on XML based (and related) approaches and BOM technology).LOG hosted two space related papers, one was presented only at LOG.LOG not identified on the 03F “Space Simulation” poster.03F-SIW-019 (on Space Weather Prediction) was poorly attended, probably due to poor publicity and late afternoon slot. Recommend a dedicated space simulation forum, or virtual forum embedded in another forum as a single block of time.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)16Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)30Peak attendance (including joint sessions)30 (no Joint)Total papers presented9Other presentations and panel discussions2Recommended Reading List nominations (including previous nominations):03F-SIW-03803F-SIW-12603F-SIW-074 (new --  based on solid presentation augmenting paper)
