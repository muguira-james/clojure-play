Support development of the DoD M&S GIG Community of Interest (COI) with an emphasis on M&S based C2 operational support for the Warfighter in the GIG and a SISO role in developing emerging standards.2.	Highlight the U.S. and International use and potential for the C2IEDM and BML efforts.3.   Highlight the use/role of M&S in testing processes for C2 and the GIG4.	Use the C4I forum to provide community updates on GIG, NCES, JC2 and other programs/efforts of interest to the SISO community.Comments and Recommendations:1.	SISO should strongly support the M&S CoI , to influence  M&S use and develop GIG and International standards that are complementary.2.	C4I forum needs to, on an ongoing basis, emphasize the active and integrated role of M&S in GIG, and Joint and International C2 in real- time OPERATIONS, rather than just simple interoperability.3.	C4I forum should also look to coordinate activities in M&S use in TESTING of C2/IS and other systems of military use under new JCIDS and DoD 5000 guidance on Joint Test and Assessment.4.   SISO needs to provide an adequate room for the C4I forum, as it consistently draws the larger crowds, and on the first day of Spring 05 SIW, C4I forum had to turn away people as the room allocated to our forum was inadequate.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)55Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)86Peak attendance (including joint sessions)86Total papers presented18“No-show” presentations0Other presentations and panel discussions4Recommended Reading List nominations (including previous nominations):1.	05S-SIW-0072.	05S-SIW-1523.	05S-SIW-1542005 SPRING SIW OUTBRIEF FORM
