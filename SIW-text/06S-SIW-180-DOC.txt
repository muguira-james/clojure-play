The group supported Kevin Galvin (UK) as Chair and Andreas Tolk (US) as Co-Chair.  As the current version of SISO’s guidelines doesn’t define the roles of Co-Chairs, Kevin Galvin accepted the role of the Chair until the role of the Co-Chair is defined and accepted by SISO.  C-BML PDG will work on a proposal in collaboration with the MSDL PDG.A close collaboration between MSDL and C-BML is ensured by a strong overlap in the officers and drafting groups.The group will conduct research in the domains to be covered by phase two and three of the PDG efforts.Attendance34Total papers presentedn/a“No-show” presentationsn/aOther presentations and panel discussionsKick-offRecommended Reading List nomination: The Product Development Group supports two papers for the inclusion in the recommended reading list, as they have a significant influence on the work and organization of C-BML:06S-SIW-016	This paper gives an overview of all C-BML related activities and uses the LCIM to show where the different standards play a role.06S-SIW-043	This paper is a first attempt to standardize the extension of C2IEDM, which will play a pivotal role in the C-BML work                 2006 SPRING SIW OUTBRIEF FORM
