I suggest we publish a list of “no show” presenters which forum chairs can use before final selections are made.Forum meeting room (Room 2) was not very desirable.  The walls did not go to the ceiling, so you could readily hear what was being discussed in the next room.  Suggest we insure presentation rooms in the future have some isolation from each other to provide the best presentation environment.Our joint session on traffic modeling drew a lot of interest. This may be an area of future opportunity for the SIWs given the greater emphasis on homeland security. We will consider a modification to the call for papers for future SIWs.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)15Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)20Peak attendance (including joint sessions)27Total papers presented11“No-show” presentations3Other presentations and panel discussions0Recommended Reading List nomination: 029                 2006 SPRING SIW OUTBRIEF FORM
