The OneTESS shall consist of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products and current and future military technology, all integrated with a variety of tools such as the High Level Architecture (HLA) and the Common Training Instrumentation Architecture (CTIA).  Additionally, every aspect of the OneTESS design shall focus on being engagement-centric, meaning that target-shooter pairings, weapons effects, and engagement resolution will depend upon the characteristics of the interacting weapons systems.  This approach produces a number of benefits, such as eliminating the need for the shooter to have any knowledge of the target, allowing damage upon the target to rely upon the characteristics of the target and the engaging weapon system, eliminating the need for mission context, and maintaining consistency in all engagement resolutions.  This paper provides a general overview of the OneTESS system, starting with an historical explanation behind its inception and transitioning into a description of the key design issues.  The paper will then segue into a high-level breakdown of the components necessary for the system followed at the end by a description of some future issues.                            IntroductionFor a number of years, Tactical Engagement Simulation (TES) has represented the Army’s best medium for infantry training.  TES systems allow for training required for advanced weapon systems such as the Land Warrior system as shown in Figure 1.  The OneTESS solution introduces a unique approach for handling the massive amount of data transfer required to effectively model a battlefield simulation populated with tens of thousands of live and simulated entities.  That approach, labeled engagement-centric, treats every interaction within the simulation as an interaction.  This concept greatly simplifies the required architecture by allowing every interaction to be treated the same way, resulting in a significant advantage of OneTESS over all previous TES systems.History of TESTactical Engagement Simulation has accumulated a long and distinguished history.  The Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) – a simple laser tag system – represents the earliest version of TES.  MILES matured and sprouted to a variety of other more realistic, fool proof, and sophisticated systems.  The following subsections describe a few examples of these descendant systems.Figure 1. Land Warrior system [1]Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES)Originally, the Army developed the first family of MILES devices – referred to as Basic MILES – in the late 1970s and early 1980s using what was at that time state-of-the-art technology. Basic MILES remains the primary training system for force-on-force training at Army home stations. However, today's training battlefield requires an improved performance and realism level that Basic MILES fails to address. Complicating the issue further, Basic MILES systems have essentially reached the end of their useful economic life cycle. As a consequence of these circumstances, the U.S. Army has assessed its training alternatives. Since the introduction of MILES, soldiers have primarily used Basic MILES systems during force-on-force exercises, from squad through brigade level, to simulate the firing and effects of actual weapon systems. These weapon systems range from the M1 Abrams Tank to the Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle to the M113 Armored Personnel Carrier to the wheeled vehicles, as well as other non-shooting targets. Furthermore, Basic MILES systems allow for the simulation of anti-armor weapons, machine guns, and rifles. However, existing Basic MILES technology does not support the level of functionality that Army commanders and trainers now require. A major shortfall of Basic MILES is that it fails to record any event data for use in After Action Reviews (AARs).  This serves as a major setback for analyzing what happened in an exercise and why.Due to these shortcomings, the Army generated an Operational Requirements Document (ORD) for a home station MILES replacement program in 1993, entitled MILES XXI that would include Basic MILES functionality, compatibility with the direct fire component of Simulated Area Weapons Effects-Radio Frequency/MILES II (SAWE-RF/MILES II), usability improvements, and training effectiveness enhancements through commercial off-the-shelf integrated circuit and laser technologies.The U.S. Army Program Executive Office – Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) awarded the MILES XXI contract to Cubic Defense systems.  [2]The MILES 2000 is the next generation of TESS. MILES 2000 is the planned replacement for the currently fielded basic MILES that has been in use since the 1980s and has reached the end of its service life. M ILES 2000 will provide the Fleet Marine Force with a family of low-power eye safe lasers that simulate the direct fire characteristics of all weapons organic to a Reinforced Infantry Battalion.  MILES 2000 will enhance the tactical training environment by replicating the direct fire range, capabilities, limitations and ammunition characteristics.  [3]Figure 2.  MILES 2000 [2]Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT)The Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT) serves as a mechanized infantry and armor company team training system designed to train crews and units to fight as a combined arms team.  The CCTT configuration consists of six manned modules: the dismounted infantry work station, the Battalion Tactical Operations Center, the Field Artillery Tactical Operations Center, brigade and combat trains, unit maintenance, and tactical command posts, fire direction center and fire support element work stations that supply command and control and AAR capabilities.  CCTT uses computer-controlled terrain and, of particular innovation, weather conditions that present both visual and aural cues to the soldiers during the simulation execution.  The simulation also provides Computer Generated Forces (CGF) of U.S., allied, and opposing force (OPFOR) units using appropriate doctrine, rules of engagement, and weapon systems.  [4]Combat Trauma Patient Simulator (CTPS)The Combat Trauma Patient Simulation (CTPS) is a dual-purpose training and analysis simulation system that physically simulates the emergency medical treatment process for selected combat injuries from the time of occurrence through the time of initial treatment at the field hospital. CTPS has been built by integrating existing commercial and military technology with the High Level Architecture (HLA).  CTPS components include the Human Patient Simulator (HPS), an electro-mechanical mannequin that models human physiology and symptoms and permits treatment by human users of the system; a simplified version of the HPS called a Pre-Hospital Simulator (PHS); a MILES-based Electronic Casualty Card (ECC), responsible for providing more detailed data describing a wound; at least one other HLA federate designated to provide comprehensive wound information for accurate casualty modeling; a virtual ward for patients that are no deemed critical or interesting at any given point in time; and the CTPS Executive, serving as the control center for an exercise.  [5]Figure 3. Human Patient Simulator (HPS) [5]Battlefield Communication Network/Tactical Engagement System (BCN/TES) The Battlefield Communication Network and Tactical Engagement Simulation (BCN/TES) program was originally intended to demonstrate how a distributed simulation infrastructure could work in a rapid-prototyping approach to study new technologies in realistic military scenarios. The BCN/TES system also demonstrated how distributed simulation could apply to evaluating the performance of wireless radio network architectures in the context of tactical maneuver and engagement.Like the CTPS system, BCN/TES is built upon an HLA network.  Furthermore, it is based upon an HLA-compliant tactical engagement simulation that models entity-level tactical maneuver and engagement behaviors on real or modeled terrain, uses an explicit representation of command and control, reconnaissance, and engagement radio traffic, and ensures realism within the battlefield scenarios and communications traffic in the network.  [6]Advanced Tactical Engagement Simulation (A-TES) Science and Technology Objective (STO)The U.S. Army's Advanced Tactical Engagement Simulation (A-TES) Science and Technology Objective (STO) was a research and development project commissioned by PEO-STRI and intended to identify and solve problems associated with the live force-on-force training of soldiers within the context of using advanced weapon systems.  More specifically, the A-TES STO identified and developed tactical engagement simulation technologies that have addressed potentially detrimental training gaps, allowing training systems to keep pace with future weapon system deployments while meeting the system-level challenges of low cost, portability, and Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) interoperability.  This project began in fiscal year 1999 (FY99) and achieved fruition in FY02.  [7]Figure 4. A-TES STO Architecture [7]Fundamental Premise of OneTESSThe OneTESS system will replace all current tactical engagement testing and training systems in use today by the U.S. Army.  The underlying concepts that define the OneTESS design will serve to make this product far more advanced than any similar system to have previously seen action within the military.  Two main ideas, to be discussed in later sections, stand above all else:OneTESS is a test and training system.OneTESS is engagement centric.The following sections describe OneTESS in greater detail.PurposeNo previous or current system has possessed the magnitude and complexity of OneTESS in its comprehensive approach to simulating all tactical engagements across the full spectrum of live force-on-force training and operational testing.   A clear understanding of the Army’s future vision for warfighting, training, and testing stands as critical to meeting these comprehensive OneTESS objectives.  The OneTESS team consists of seven industry leaders who collectively bring a comprehensive understanding of the Army vision and the technical skills, innovation and desire to escort OneTESS from vision to reality.  The OneTESS system concept and architecture specifically address the Army’s global objectives, including:Achieving of the Army-defined requirements and objectives as set forth in the OneTESS Operational Requirements Document (ORD)Supporting a common simulated training engagement (STE) methodology, consistent and repeatable among the live, virtual, and constructive training environmentsAllowing growth as requirements evolve, technologies mature, and threat capabilities changeProviding a path to achieve an initial operating capability (IOC) at threshold levels in FY08Synchronizing, leveraging, and interfacing with the Future Combat System (FCS), Common Training Instrumentation Architecture (CTIA), and National Training Center Objective Instrumentation System (NTC-OIS)Maintaining a software management process at no less than Capability Maturity Model (CMM) level 3 as specified by the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) and for a Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) in accordance with Department of Defense (DoD) standard 5000.2-R.Minimizing life cycle ownership costsProviding a OneTESS solution for testingThe following section and subsections describe in detail the OneTESS solution.  [8]OneTESS Solution FrameworkThe OneTESS solution result from the incorporation of the five technical Contract Data Requirements Lists (CDRLs) into a single cohesive strategy that results in a highly flexible and open system design capable of achieving a common engagement-centric solution for both the testing and training communities.  [8]Engagement Centric SystemTo accommodate changes inherent with a long life-cycle system, the OneTESS team has employed a flexible, scalable, and modular approach to adjust for expansion, changing technologies, changing concepts, changing hardware, new training methods, and modified doctrine, and to accept new systems as appropriate, as they become available.  The OneTESS solution centers around an engagement system with target driven resolution employing existing engagement resolution strategies such as centralized resolution, distributed engagement resolution, and a hybrid resolution approach.  This approach places the engagement resolution process at the core of OneTESS rather than at the system interfaces.  This common resolution process for engagements greatly reduces architecture complexity.  Similarly, an architecture in which targets resolve all engagements, lessens communications traffic.  The engagement-centric approach enables OneTESS to support both test and training communities.  [8]Common Design for Test and TrainingBecause of the engagement-centric concept of OneTESS, the characteristics of the engaging weapon system and the engaged target – not the mission – define the driving factors in establishing pairing and resolution for any OneTESS engagement.  The characteristics of a target and the weapon system engaging it determine the damage inflicted on that target.  The effects should be the same regardless of whether the execution is for testing, for training, or for warfighting.  For this reason, the OneTESS system concept, architecture and conceptual design are common for both testing and training.  [8]Flexible  Communications A critical function for a successful instantiation of OneTESS is communications.  With the OneTESS architecture, communications control the performance of OneTESS.  OneTESS must transfer large volumes of engagement data in a timely manner to support real-time adjudication.  Data must transfer from one system to another faster than the flight time of the engagement event.  Therefore, the Quality of Service factors and routing times for OneTESS are an order of magnitude greater than currently available communications systems using the present centralized topologies and limited bandwidth that OneTESS will use.   The OneTESS concept uses Mobile Ad hoc Networking (MANET) communications techniques combined with other network management technologies.  This approach provides a fast and efficient communication capability without the need for a fixed infrastructure.  [8]The communications portion of OneTESS will be discussed in greater detail later in this paper.Open ArchitectureThe OneTESS system concept centers around an open architecture that facilitates core system longevity, supports infusion of new technologies, and permits the addition of new weapon systems and capabilities without retrofitting previously fielded OneTESS hardware.  This approach promotes competition by encouraging multiple venders to vie for the development of OneTESS implementations and sub-components.  [8]Important Terms and DefinitionsIn an effort to revolutionize the TES environment, OneTESS introduces a host of vocabulary terms that require unambiguous definitions to allow a lucid understanding of the system.  The following terms provide context to the central concept behind OneTESS and should further clarify the engagement-centric concept.OneTESS Entity – any OneTESS equipped object in the battle spaceEngagement – the interaction between any two OneTESS entities in the battle spaceShooter – the OneTESS entity initiating an engagement (a shooter is not required to be a weapon system)Target – the OneTESS entity receiving the effects of an engagementElectronic Bullet – the data packet transmitting engagement information from a shooter to a targetLive Player – any physical object in the battle space that can shoot or be shot atPlayer Unit – the manifestation of the OneTESS on a live player  [8]EngagementsAs one might expect, the engagements between OneTESS entities stand as the central figures within an engagement-centric system.  This section presents greater detail of OneTESS engagements.The following components describe the requirements that address achieving OneTESS engagement adjudication:Registration of entities within a central database to allow them to engageStatus, profile, and configuration of all players and platforms involved in the engagementPosition, location, and orientationDead reckoningObscuration, structures, landscape features, and impediments cover as opposed to concealmentTerrain mapping and strategic informationTime domain relevance of players and engagementsPredicted locationRules of engagementEngagement resolution sequenceAimingPairing sequence Pairing rules and tablesEngagement sequenceEvent triggers and time taggingStop, restart, and replayArbitration hierarchyProcessing and filtering of data to form information and knowledgeAssessment resultsClassified data used in adjudicationClearly, the process of engagement resolution in the OneTESS system must take into account a plethora of data.  This list, which likely will grow as the OneTESS system matures, demonstrates how complicated an engagement-centric approach will prove to be.  [8]CommunicationsAs mentioned before, among the most critical functional elements for a successful instantiation of OneTESS is communications.  OneTESS needs information to be exchanged at speeds faster than the flight time of the engagement event, whether it is the flight of a .223 bullet, an armor piercing sabot, or an electronic warfare event.  Therefore, the Quality of Service and routing times for OneTESS are an order of magnitude greater than currently available communications systems using the present centralized topologies and limited bandwidth.   A potential solution to this challenge is the use of Mobile Ad hoc Networking (MANET) communications technique discussed later in this document.The OneTESS solution must consider both primitive and advanced communication methods and technologies.  Among those considerations are the following:Single channel radioSpread Spectrum and channel hoppingUltra wide bandDistributed Mission Trainer (DMT) and Quality Assurance Monitoring (QAM) using constellation codingSatelliteUpper atmosphere balloonsInfrared via open-air transceiversPulse coded laserFiber OpticsSmoke signals, mirrors couriers, beacons and unconventional exchangesThe communications protocols used in OneTESS must work with the protocols used in wired networks.  OneTESS will operate with communications networks ranging from wired networks to commercial communications networks to the Fixed Tactical Internets used at home station-training locations. Gateway devices will translate messages and routing information between OneTESS and external networks.To solve the OneTESS challenge of accommodating large numbers of entities, the understanding of present-day communications barriers must improve. The advantages and disadvantages of the OneTESS communications solution are as follows:Pros:Immediate knowledge of engagement results at central nodeReduced processing requirements on player unitsEasier use of classified models (store on central node)Cons:Increased network traffic on a limited bandwidth spectrum, thus creating a bottleneck.  Players compete for a limited number of communications channels, limiting scalability.  Requires a central node infrastructureThe central node is a single point of failure  [8]Figure 5. Communications infrastructure  [8]Additionally, the central node requires a large degree of concentrated processing ability, a resource available in finite quantities.To maintain the network performance required to achieve the highest possible training value, OneTESS communications must segregate connections and limit data exchange to the minimum number of components while ensuring that the most time-critical communications process with the least possible delay. Achieving these goals will necessitate a communications hierarchy that takes into account both the expected traffic characteristics and the most practical technologies for mobile battlefield communications.Given the expected OneTESS communications characteristics, the OneTESS team has derived a communications hierarchy that will support rapid data transfer for short range engagements, reliable routing for long range engagements, and segregation of connections to specific geographic areas.  To accomplish these feats, the OneTESS hierarchy progresses from a peer to peer Player Area Network (PAN) that provides communications limited to a group of single combatants to a geographically partitioned Wide Area Network (WAN) that supports communications across multiple clusters of players spread across a large region.To that end, the following networking paradigms must be fully understood:Player Area Networks.  A relatively compact and very local communications network associated with an individual player such as a dismount or vehicleClusters of Cluster Area Networks (CAN). A group of players who intercommunicate within a limited local wireless network.  These entities may be any combination of dismounts, vehicles, devices (such as mines), and may also include virtual or constructive devices interacting in the cluster.Clusterheads.  A primary communication gateway or bridge into a cluster.  A clusterhead can be considered the master communication portal for the cluster.Geographic Area Networks.  A physically defined communication area, usually patterned into a grid pattern.  The concept of a geographic area network is used to relate communicating entities or clusters to actual terrain and position/location tracking (PLT).Wide Area Network or WAN.  For the purpose of OneTESS, a WAN is an entire battlefield or theatre area describing all the communicating entities, clusters or geographic communications areas.  [8]Figure 6.  OneTESS communications hierarchy [9]While the OneTESS system concept focuses on engagement-centricity, the communications infrastructure stands as the most vital component.  The communication design will likely determine the difference between success and failure.ConclusionThe concept of an engagement-centric TES greatly simplifies the required architecture by allowing every interaction to be treated the same way, resulting in a significant advantage of OneTESS over all previous TES systems.  Since the 1970’s, TES has represented the Army’s best and most commonly used medium for infantry training.  The OneTESS solution of engagement-centricity introduces a novel approach for handling what has always amounted to tremendous volumes of data transfer to effectively model a battlefield simulation populated with tens of thousands of live and simulated entities.  This concept separates OneTESS from previous TES systems and will propel it towards success.References[1] “Land Warrior,” Federation of American Scientists,  HYPERLINK "http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/land-warrior.htm" http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/land-warrior.htm[2] “MILES 2000 Program Overview,”  HYPERLINK "http://www.peostri.army.mil/PRODUCTS/MILES/MILES.ppt" http://www.peostri.army.mil/PRODUCTS/MILES/MILES.ppt[3] “Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) 2000,” http://hqinet001.hqmc.usmc.mil/p&r/ concepts/2000/PDFs/Chapter4/MILES.pdf[4] Jodeit, David M., Dennis L.
