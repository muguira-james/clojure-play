These categories are further divided into geospatial data, command and control data, and other sub-groups. So far, this effort was more done by best guess and ad-hoc approaches. This paper will apply scientifically sound methods of ontology and taxonomy research to specify a sound taxonomy for data to be interchanged and managed by C4ISR and M&S systems. These requirements will assist the, Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (C4ISR) and Models and Simulation (CSIM) Systems developer on technical and operational constraints addressing a full range of services from training, analysis, alternative course of action analysis, Effects based operations, acquisition requirements and many other requirements, each of which may have different objectives that order different representational details, timing constraints, dispensation demands, etc. This paper will discuss the extension of the C4ISR Technical Reference Model PDG to develop semantic interoperable Modeling and Simulation Services for Joint Command and Control. While many of these services will operate within HLA, DODAF, JTA and JC2 standards, some may require parallel processing or other unique configurations, bringing with them their own set of requirements. The CSIM Reference Model will follow standards developed from the SISO Product Development Group established in 2003 and the extensions developed within this paper. This paper will look at the uses of a common data exchange mechanism (C2IEDM), levels of conceptual interoperability Model (LCIM), use of Battle Management Language (BML), Web enabled Modeling and Simulation Services (XMSF), and other technologies and frameworks to prove that the C4ISR TRM is a viable means to support CSIM as an embedded simulation within Command and Control Systems..IntroductionIn my last SISO papers I have given some high level views on the Department of Defense Modeling and Simulation and Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) and their short comings of developing composable simulation frameworks outside of Military training and experimentation, which does not promote the mentality of “train as we fight”.  The development of concepts such as Network Centric Warfare (NCW) and Effects Based Operations (EBO) are attempts to structure, understand and take advantage of the opportunities that are now exposed in the transformation processes involving technology, organization, doctrine, training, leadership and culture. NCW essentially encompasses the idea of interconnecting a heterogeneous range of actors and objects (typically called effectors, sensors, decision makers etc) in the battle-space through telecommunication, computer networks and Modeling and Simulation capabilities. The advantages of NCW are:• The most ideally located decision maker may engage any target within range of the networked sensors, and may employ the best-suited effectors for the engagement mission (self-synchronization) utilizing simulations. • Multi-role objects allow interchange of information and flexible usage of all resources (multi-functionality). • All levels of the command organization may receive and utilize the available information, at no incremental cost (information “overlaying”). The above benefits not only provide solutions and opportunities, but also pose central dilemmas. As an example, consider the self-synchronization and overlaying aspects of NCW. In effect, these will lead to a “collapse” of the traditional command hierarchy (tactical, operational and strategic levels). When all actors receive all information, there is a high risk of information overload, let alone potential confusion when it comes to who is going to implement what decision. EBO may in many ways be regarded as the defense analyst’s attempt to turn the multi-faceted implications of NCW into analyzable and well-structured problems, in that it provides a modified and fruitful perspective on operational dynamics. That is, it offers insight into the “driving forces” governing modern warfare and conflict resolution. Davis [1] defines EBO as “operations conceived and planned in a systems framework that considers the full range of direct, indirect, and cascading effects that may, with different degrees of probability, be achieved by the application of embedded simulations.   Where do we (DOD M&S community) go to prove that these wonderful tools we have developed can be utilized to save lives and assist the decision makers to develop alternative course of Actions and mission rehearsal on the fly.  There has been much progress on the theoretical side of M&S composability and a formal theory of composability, but there has been a lack of progress in introducing composability for command and control and modeling and simulation interoperability, which has left us with a number of unusable systems in today’s ever changing battlefield.  The M&S systems and C2 systems do not have the needed taxonomies and ontology’s to change on the “FLY” to support Net-Centric capabilities and the vision of the Global Information Grid (GIG) to name a few. Why do the M&S and C2 communities work the exact same requirements but in very different stovepipes? They develop systems that require the same terrain, datasets, taxonomies and ontology’s that support the same audience for the same effect.  This paper will give some insight into how the use of the C4ISR Technical Reference Model [2] (SISO C4ISR TRM) the use of my research and cooperation from future C2 planning systems can contain embedded simulations and will show that this is a must for the future of Department of Defense. As the need for valid and doctrinal sound simulations increases for real world operations the importance of common information exchange mechanisms, common frameworks and common practices will have to be formed and utilized.  I will utilize the military sense making process as the platform to perform experiments and analysis to prove that current technology and frameworks exist to promote that a level of composability can exist.  Within the command and control process, sense making is a creative process with very limitedly support from C4ESIM Systems.Command and control quality has been increased by an order of magnitude as we have moved from data-driven solutions (a System-centric approach exchanging text messages) towards information-driven solutions (a System-of-systems Net-centric approach utilizing a common operational picture).  Modeling & Simulation (M&S) functions and data manipulation will become an integral component within Net-centric operations. Background2.1 The SISO Technical Reference Model The Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization (SISO) initially chartered a Study Group (SG) for M&S-to-Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) Interoperability (SG-C4I), which began work at the 1999 Fall Simulation Interoperability Workshop (SIW) and submitted a final report [3] to SISO at the fall 2000 SIW.  This report analyzed and discussed the status quo, and recommended a course to follow with respect to C4ISR/simulation (C4ISR/Sim) interoperability.  Specifically, the report recommended the formation of a follow-on C4ISR/Sim SG to begin work on a broad-based Technical Reference Model (TRM) that would provide a standard frame of reference describing and categorizing interoperability among, and supporting the interfacing of C4ISR systems and simulations.  The C4ISR/Sim TRM SG I began work at the 2001 Spring SIW and submitted a Final Report that outlined the basis for a C4ISR/Sim TRM and recommended that a follow-on study group be chartered by SISO to continue the development of the C4ISR/Sim TRM.  The C4ISR/Sim TRM will help to standardize at least the way of evaluating the data to be exchanged between the various systems.  However, the potential of the C4ISR/Sim TRM is higher than being a reference model for interchanged data.  The long-term goal was to contribute to the common understanding of heterogeneous IT support for the Warfighter, i.e., establishing a common view of the domain space enabling that functionality delivered encapsulated in modules or components can be made available whenever and wherever needed without having to care about the origin.  The new concept of the Global Information Grid (GIG) is supporting this view.  One of the most envisioning views of command and control taking advantage of these concepts is given in the recent publication “Power to the Edge – Command and Control in the Information Age”.  However, the view of using functionality in data in whatever form it is presented on the GIG for your own purpose stresses the necessity for a common view of the problem, therefore, the C4ISR/Sim TRM will be needed more than ever to support the necessary data management as envisioned in the first version of the Net-Centric Data Strategy and the related U.S. DoD Data Management processes.  The C4ISR/Sim TRM therefore would serve as an initial starting point (enabling the interfacing of legacy systems based on a common understanding of information exchanged) as well as a management facility for the envisioned end state of heterogeneous functionality support within the global information sphere. There is a huge push in the simulation community to become more interoperable with C4ISR systems. The C4ISR Technical Reference Model (TRM) is currently being developed with the goal of becoming the standard frame of reference between C4ISR and Modeling and Simulation (M&S) systems.  In a position paper for the 2003 International Conference on Grand Challenges for M&S (ICGCMS ’03), Dr. Andreas Tolk proposed the grand challenge of “merging of C4ISR and M&S components into heterogeneous systems supporting the Warfighter” (Tolk [4]) These and other efforts have the top level goal of increasing interoperability between the two communities, but are focusing on the interface of existing C4ISR systems with virtual simulations. Left largely unaddressed is the possibility of building constructive combat simulations based With the evolution of many of the SISO study Groups the C4ISR TRM SG was The C4ISR/Sim TRM within the context of actual IT ArchitecturesTo ensure the correct use of the C4ISR/Sim TRM in the given legacy context as well as to enable the applicability of the C4ISR/Sim TRM in the role envisioned above, the role of the TRM as described in this document within the broader context has to be defined to be able to understand its potential and constraints respectively.  A general view on the problems of shared solutions in heterogeneous IT environments usable for C4ISR as well as Simulation Systems is given in the House Diagram, which blueprints the complexity of interfacing simulation systems and C4ISR applications.  This holistic view emphasizes the interdependency of five major factors involved in the effort to secure shared solutions for C4ISR/M&S interoperability: Architectures Alignment, Common Data/Object Models, Common Standards, Alignment Processes, and Reusable Component Interfaces.Architecture Alignment recognizes the fundamental necessity to align the framework architectures for both M&S and C4ISR domains. As already pointed out earlier, the US DOD C4ISR community has developed the Defence Information Infrastructure Common Operating Environment. NATO is using the NATO Technical Architecture Model. The Modelling and Simulation (M&S) community has established the High Level Architecture. These constructs establish the foundations that set the requirements for fundamental interoperability between components of these two domains. The architecture alignment needs to be able to resolve differences in viewpoints or fundamental representation of the “problem space”.Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 1:	The “House Diagram” for Interoperable Shared SystemsWithin the M&S domain, the HLA Federation Object Model (FOM) methodology is used to align Data Models and Object Models among M&S federates. While this methodology works, it places a heavy burden on developers. When extending beyond the M&S domain into the C4ISR domain, temporary (situational) alignment presents additional challenges: synchronizing development cycles, aligning domain ontology, and coordinating data standards. These constraints normally resolve into the need for a data translation layer between C4ISR and simulation domains. However, this gateway strategy can exact a major performance penalty. If systems are aligned to the same or similar object model or data model representations, performance increases as translation penalties and FOM alignment burdens decrease. The next subsection on data management, data administration and data alignment will deal especially with this important topic.Common Standards are most effective when they are part of the system design. Integration of standards begins with the framework architecture for each domain and extends through the support for common objects and data models. To this end, C4ISR and M&S systems should be designed initially for interoperability.Reusable Component Interfaces sit on top, and therefore rest upon, the building blocks below. However, when compared to architectures, models, or standards, interfaces have been a hotbed of activity. This apparent paradox stems from our ability to partition the problem space at the interface and thus provide short-term solutions for quick success. However, in general these solutions are too shallow, one has to pay and pay again for these unique interfaces in terms of costs, time, and flexibility. If realignment of the underlying structures eliminates basic incompatibilities between the systems and a wealth of benefits ensues.Finally, the roof of the house diagram envisions Shared Solutions between C4ISR and Simulations. This aspiration must be supported by all of the underlying blocks. In addition, it requires that the systems align or translate inherent processes. For example, terrain alignment and object placement must be consistent between components in both domains.allowing participants to use the very same equipment in the simulation that they would use in war. This also makes the experience more realistic and directly transferable to wartime operations, which is particularly important for providing commanders the opportunity to develop and evaluate operation plans. Even during a war, alternative plans can be experimented through simulation before being implemented. These two ideas are expressed as train-as-you-fight and take-the-simulation-to-war. To make distributed simulation possible, the various models and communications must comply with a consistent set of protocol standards.  2.3 DOD Technical Reference Model (TRM)The DoD TRM provides guidance to developers, system architects, and individuals in using and developing systems and technical architectures.  The model promotes open system design but is not system architecture. The DoD TRM establishes a common vocabulary and defines a set of services and interfaces common to DoD systems. The reference model provides the foundation for the organization and structure for technical architectures. The reference model and technical architecture support the operational architecture and become the key drivers for the development of the systems architecture. The DoD TRM is to be considered as the foundation model describing services, interfaces, and their interrelationships that can be applied to all systems. As further stated in DoD TRM documents; “The intent of the [DoD] Technical Reference Model is to minimize continued proliferation of domain models in support of open systems and interoperability across domains, in joint operations, and across a wide range of applications”. However, the DoD TRM does provide for “tailoring” of model views in order to develop domain specific models as required. Within this capability, the C4ISR/M&S TRM should be seen as a “tailoring” of the DoD TRM, specific to the M&S and C4ISR/M&S Interface domain. In order to reflect the validity of this tailoring, an effort was undertaken to map the Simulation System modules into DoD TRM “System Services” and inter-system interactions to DoD TRM “Interface View”.2.4 DoD TRM System ServicesThe DoD TRM describes 3 service areas (Application Software, Application Platform, External Environment) and lists and defines 23 individual service types as part of its System Services view. The system model view presents a way of establishing communications between systems to resolve differences in their service content, and enable the identification of direct and logical interfaces between entities. Documentation indicates, “services may reside on more than one platform and accessed through logical interfaces.” It continues on to describe suggested details of individual service areas and services, as well as methods for the DoD TRM to be used. In order to assess the relationship between the DoD TRM and C4ISR/M&S TRM, an attempt was made to map the Simulation Modules (analogous to services) into the various services described in the DoD TRM. To give an example of the drill that was conducted for Simulation Control, there was not a single clear service description that seemed to map. It was speculated that this was because this was an effort to map a model to another model, rather then a fully developed system to a single TRM. In other words, depending upon architecture design and implementation choices for a C4I to Simulation interface or integration project, simulation control may be implemented closer to one DoD service type than another. The Visualization module seemed to be an easy fit to the Multimedia Services, as the latter “provide the capability to manipulate and manage information  consisting of text, graphics, images, video, and audio”, as well as later referring specifically to Graphic Information System (GIS) services. Another relatively easy mapping was the Simulation & Models Module aggregate block. The S&M Module mapped to the Engineering Support services because of the latter’s reference to “decision support services”, modeling and simulation services”, and “expert system services”, all of which are potential applications for interfaces or integration. Although Simulation Engine(s) or Model(s) are highly unlikely to be embedded (or interfaced to) by themselves, the possibility exists. As an example, it might be desirable to embed a Simulation Engine, which dynamically loads Models (as data parameters, executable components, etc) from some central repository. Listing them as mapping to Engineering Support was more of a default based on their inherent relationship to a “simulation” rather then a clear cut match. Other then this possibility, more obscure mappings could be made (e.g. Simulation Engine – User Application / Models – Data Management Services). It was consideration of these module mappings that reinforced that the DoD TRM is a much generalized model and as such cannot (or has not yet) identified all possible domain services that could be provided. Therefore, although there is value in considering a mapping to DoD TRM services for the purposes of communication with systems designed and built using this model, there is still relevance to a domain specific model such as the C4I/M&S TRM, which contains descriptions that should be clearer to domain practitioners.2.5	DoD TRM Interface ViewThe DoD TRM draws strongly on the previous work defined in the Generic Open Architecture GOA Framework. It reflects a series of layers into which the categories and services are mapped. It then provides generic ways to describe interfaces between services (modules) or aggregate categories. Types of interfaces include Logical (peer-to- peer), Direct (vertical/hierarchical), Application Program Interface (API), and External. Clearly, selection and elaboration of interfaces are dependent on program management and/or architectural design. Further, they can be strongly tied to application domain. Therefore, the DoD TRM interface view is capable of providing guidance on creating highly structured interface descriptions of generic components and/or services, but without the beneficial description of the content passed through such interfaces. In this type of situation, a combined use of the DoD TRM (for structure) and C4ISR/M&S TRM (for content) may be a more advantageous usage to one or the other. As an alternative, further work on development of the C4ISR/M&S TRM would be suggested. This work should focus on adding to the robust content description by a structured usage methodology, perhaps adapting the GOA Framework. 2.6. Department of Defense Technical Reference Model The DoD TRM, as indicated earlier, is a much generalized reference model. It can and has been used for the specification of a broad range of information management systems. Because of its generality, it can be advantageous to “tailor” or supplement its tools with more domain specific references. As was shown in the analysis presented above, a number of the service categories can be vague and/or ambiguous when considered in reference to simulations or C4ISR/M&S interface/integration efforts. It is recommended that its use encouraged, along with the C4ISR/M&S TRM for domain specific clarification.  Figure 2 . C4ISR TRM as of Closing of the PDG Other Work leveraged       Products and results from numerous efforts are being leveraged in the development of this Taxonomy the main two leveraged are Navy’s Embedded Simulation Infrastructure (ESI) [5] and the levels of Conceptual interoperability (LCIM)   Figure 3 (ESI)3.2 Levels of Conceptual interoperability (LCIM).  Just as with the original LCIM figure 4, the basis for all interoperability builds on level 0, which is no interoperability at all. Systems at this level either cannot, or need not communicate with each other. The remaining levels, 1 through 6 figure 4, describe interoperability-enabling communications of increasing amounts of understanding [Turnitsa [6] 2004]. This understanding is not only of the target system understanding data passed to it from a source system, but also the understanding made by a source system of what is needed by the target system.  The LCIM gives CSIM the ability to measure interoperability levels.                 Figure 4. LCIM Objective The purpose for this research is to take already developed solutions draw some requirements and develop taxonomy for embedded Simulations within a transformational (NCOW) Command and Control systems that can generate information to support Sense Making, Effects Based operations and Course of Action Analysis.  This Taxonomy will support:Improve data exchange and initializationScenario, terrain aggregation Support on the fly Course of Action AnalysisEffects based operations Net centric OperationsRequire no federation and simulation execution 4.0 Research DescriptionThe specific project goals were as follows:Capture and develop a taxonomy for embedding a simulation within the planning systemMeasure the levels of interoperability using the LCIMDevelop an information exchange model from C2IEDMFormulate a specification for the embedded simulation Develop user Requirements C2 System developer and user interviewsM&S developer and operations researchers4.1 State of the problem today. While any simulation that is HLA compliant could in theory derive data from a Command & Control System in this manner, there are only a select few that are used in the execution COA (Course of Action) and deliberate planning applications that really need this of capability. The Joint Warfare System (JWARS) and the Joint Semi-Autonomous Forces Simulations (JSAF) are these types of simulations that have HLA interface for use with other applications, which would provide a straightforward approach for implementation with the Command and Control System.  “While the Common Operational Picture from the C2 system provides a significant amount of information on enemy and friendly units, it does not contain several bits of data of interest to the analysis of COAs. Among the data sources that would be beneficial for inclusion in this federation are the Master Intelligence Database (MIDB), Status of Resources and Training Systems (SORTS), and Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES) data. Also, since GCCS is an aggregated view of the entire theater battle, it tends to lack certain detail that can be found in component data sources such as Theater Battle Management Core System (TBMCS), and the Joint Common Database (JCDB). Implementation of COA analysis at lower echelons may require finer resolution data that can only be found in these component C4ISR systems which would provide Situational awareness.  Situational Awareness is the perception of the elements in the environment within a volume of time and space, the comprehension of their meaning, and the projection of their status in the near future”. The SA concept is therefore essential to accomplish rapid and “correct” decision making in operations. According to Brewster (2002), many studies within military and scientific communities conclude that (military) commanders actually rely more heavily on an intuitive versus an analytic approach when in a field environment. The intuitive approach to decision making appears to be chosen when facing: ill-structured problems; uncertain or dynamic environments; time stress; and/or high stakes.  The Air force is currently working on the definitions of its Core 10.2 and 10.3 baselines Architecture for it Aerospace Operations Center for the years 2005-2010 and they have included the need for modeling and simulation capabilities to enable EBO, Airspace de-confliction and Course of Action Analysis within its Command and Control Systems, so the Air Force is developing the Theater Battle Operations Net centric Environment (TBONE). TBONE vision is to create dynamic planning and execution capability that links requests, effects, operational guidance and supporting tasks with temporal / geospatial unified databases, while will require simulations as its analytical resource.  This is the reason I have selected to use TBONE for the development of the C4ESIM taxonomy.

Unfortunately my research has gained little to no progress over  the last 6 months due to the close nature of the Air force and the development  of TBONE and my inability to get an alpha or beta copy of the system.  With the Schedule of JEFX 06 and the delivery of TBONE I am pressing to have my taxonomy validated during JEFX 06.  I hope to assist the developers of the TBONE systems with my taxonomy.  I hope to have findings from my research in the Spring SIW 2006.References [1]DavisPK.2001.Effects-Based operations (EBO): A Grand Challenge for the Analytical Community.
