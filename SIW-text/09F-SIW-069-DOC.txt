Some VF training events include Army, Navy, and Marine Command and Control (C2) assets.  One important training objective focuses on Tactical Data Link (TDL) warfighter training.  Since the DMOC implements a number of TDLs within the Battlespace, the opportunity exists to provide a multiple TDL training venue.   The TDLs used include Link 16, Global Command and Control System (GCCS) J, IBS-I, IBS-S, and Blue Force Tracker.  These data links are integrated on to a C2 TDL Wide Area Network (WAN).The DMOC has led the distributed modeling and simulation standards efforts for several of these TDLs.  A new effort the DMOC is undertaking is to integrate the Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL) into the DMOC battlespace.  This additional capability will add the DMOC SADL assets, F-16 UTD and XCITE, to the Virtual Flag tactical data link training venue, and incorporates the A-10C simulators from remote sites.  This effort is in two parts.  First, make use of the draft SISO standard for SADL (SADL TALES), and use this project to refine and complete the standard.  The second is to convert SADL messages to Link 16 using the Joint Range Extension (JRE).  This paper presents the approach and implementation of each part.    IntroductionThe Air Force Distributed Mission Operations Center of Excellence (DMOC), located at Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, received funding to incorporate Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL) into the DMOC battlespace.  The project will make use of the draft SISO SADL Standard, SADL TALES (Ref [3]).  The standard, based on SISO-STD-002 (Ref [4]), models the SADL network and messages using Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) Signal and Transmitter Protocol Data Units (PDUs).  Note that the same message sets and network are used for the Enhanced Position Location Reporting System (EPLRS).  Basically, SADL is an EPLRS radio.The draft SISO SADL Standard, referred to as “SISO S”, has been implemented by the Computer Generated Forces (CGF) eXperimental Common Immersive Theater Environment (XCITE).  DMOC currently has XCITE version 4.0 that will generate the messages to test the DMOC SADL radio emulator.The DMOC DIS Network Analyzer Tool (DISNAT) has been modified to read the SADL Transmitter and Signal PDUs for analysis purposes.  The DMOC DIS Filter has the capability to filter Signal PDUs by TDL type, and Transmitter PDUs by Radio Entity Type Category, so no changes are required for the DIS Filter.  SADL DIS ModelThe SADL DIS model uses the Transmitter and Signal PDUs to model the SADL network and transmit and receive SADL messages.  The Transmitter PDU has 5 modulation parameters that model the network and SADL radio.  The Signal PDU has 160 bits after the samples field to model the SADL radio and network.  The SADL message is added after the 160 bits of modeling.  The DIS Enumerations Document [Ref (6)] has assigned enumerations for the Signal PDU TDL type field – 5 for SADL, and 22 for EPLRS.  SADL radios are capable of sending J2.2, J3.2, J3.5, J12.0, J12.6, J13.2, and J28.2 TADIL J messages.  Note that the TADIL J header generated by the SADL radio is different than a TADIL J header generated by a Link 16 Class 2 radio.  The differences are shown in Figure 1.SADL also uses K-series messages, specifically, the K05.1 and K05.19 messages.  K series messages are also known as Variable Message Format (VMF), which is described in detail in MIL-STD-6017.  There is also a variable length header described in MIL-STD-2045-47001C.  VMF messages can be rather large, and would require more than one UDP packet.Link 16 TADIL J HeaderDescriptionLink 16 MessageLink 16 Header Word FormatTimeslot TypeBits 0-2Indicates 3, 6, or 12 TADIL J words per timeslotRelay Transmission IndicatorBit 3Interpreted with Timeslot typeSource Track Number of SenderBits 4 - 18TN of unit that originated messageSecure Data UnitSerial NumberBits 19 - 34Data inserted by source secure data unit of originatorPaddingBits 35-47TADIL J Word #1TADIL J Word75 BitsReference TADIL J Message Standard 6016CPadding5 BitsTADIL J Word #N (to maximum number of messages)TADIL J Word75 BitsReference TADIL J Message Standard 6016CSADL TADIL J HeaderDescriptionSADL MessageLink 16 Header used in SADL NetworkPaddingBits 0-3Padding (Not applicable in EPLRS signal)Source Track Number of SenderBit 4-18TN assigned to unit.

SADL TALES EPLRS Signal PDU model has an additional 1064 bits after the 160 bits in the Signal PDU that has segment fields that split up the K series message into multiple Signal PDUs.  The receiver can then re-assemble the multiple Signal PDUs in proper order to reconstruct the K series message.  The TDL type for EPLRS K series messages is 22, so one can filter out EPLRS K series messages, or SADL radio messages based on TDL type.  The Signal PDU header for K series messages is shown in Figure 2.The SADL DIS model has 4 levels of fidelity.  Each level is interoperable with the other, not unlike the SISO Link 16 model.  There are interoperability rules, again, like the SISO Link 16 model.  Each fidelity level increases the modeling fidelity of the SADL network.  All Transmitter PDU modulation parameters are required regardless of the fidelity level.  For the Signal PDU, there are 3 parameters required for fidelity level zero.  All other fields are set to FF, or “wildcard” values.  Level 1 meters the amount of SADL messages in the data portion.  Level 2 adds more of the Signal PDU parameters, and Level 3 contains timing requirements.  Realistically, Level 3 could only be used in a lab, where latencies approach microseconds. SADL HLA ModelThe Link 16 HLA model is a Base Object Model (BOM), and can be easily added to a Federation ObjectFieldTypeRangeReserved (160 bits)160 bitsSADL Signal PDU headerHeader Length16-bit unsigned integerN/AMessage Format8-bit enumerationThis will typically be VMF (0)Version8-bit enumerationVMF Message Version, typically 6017ASegment Number32-bit unsigned integerN/ATotal Segments32-bit unsigned integerN/AMessage Number64-bit string (8characters)N/ASource Address64-bit string (8characters)N/APrecedence8-bit enumerationRoutine, Priority, Immediate, Flash, or EmergencyClassification8-bit enumeration8 bitsPadding8-bits unusedN/ANumber of Destinations (N)8-bit unsigned integer0..16Destination Address 164-bit string (8characters)N/A……Destination Address N64-bit string (8characters)N/AEPLRS Message DataMessage DatavariesN/AFigure 2:  Signal PDU Header for K series Message.Model (FOM).  When the Link 16 BOM was designed, it was added such that it would support future implementation of other tactical data links.  The SADL BOM has two assumptions.  First, that the parent FOM contains all current DIS Transmitter PDU records (not those associated with the PDU header) as part of its object class hierarchy; and second, The parent FOM contains all current DIS Signal PDU records (not those associated with the PDU header) in accordance with Reference 5 as part of its interaction class hierarchy.  The EPLRS/SADL BOM defines no new object classes. Instead the BOM defines a single complex data type (SADLTransmitterStruct) that corresponds to the modulation parameters in the DIS Transmitter PDU.  The EPLRS/SADL BOM also adds a family of interactions that will support future TDL implementation of other datalinks.  The family of interactions is a hierarchy in which the BOM’s base class for this interaction is a generic class - the TDLBinaryRadioSignal interaction. This class is an empty class, contains no parameters, and is neither publishable nor subscribable.  The specific parameters are properties of the various subclasses of this generic base class, and it is these subclasses that are published and subscribed to. The SADLRadioSignal interaction, which is a subclass of the TDLBinaryRadioSignal interaction, contains the JTIDS Network Header Parameters. The EPLRS/SADL BOM design is such that the TDLBinaryRadioSignal interaction becomes a subclass of the parent FOM's equivalent of the DIS Signal PDU.DMOC Battlespace SADL Integration PlanBringing SADL into the DMOC battlespace involves creating an application that can remove the DIS “SISO S” headers and sending it to the JRE for conversion into Link 16 messages.  This application is called the SADL Radio Emulator.  SADL Radio EmulatorThe DMOC SADL Radio Emulator will do two tasks.  One will emulate some SADL radio functions to properly connect to the JRE.  The other will read in the SADL transmitter-signal-transmitter PDU wrap, strip the Signal PDU header and 160 bit model parameters, and then send the TADIL J or K series message to the JRE.  The JRE has an application called the TMPG, which will convert the K series messages into TADIL J.  Note that the K05.1 and K05.19 messages do not exceed the DIS standard packet length of 1500 Bytes.  The Radio Emulator is not required to reassemble the K series message from multiple packets, but will be a future capability.SADL Radio Emulator InterfaceThe SADL Radio Emulator will act as the SADL Radio and connect to the JRE, which will be a host.  First, the SADL radio emulator will send an Ethernet Setup Message to the radio identifying its local UDP port and IP address. The JRE will then send a valid initialization message to the host.  Once received, the SADL radio emulator configures the UDP socket port and address, and then sends initialization messages to establish proper message exchange.The JRE then sends a host initialization message, consisting of 10 words.  These words contain all the necessary radio and link parameters to establish connectivity between the JRE and the host.  Once the Host Initialization is complete, The Data Link Response and Data Link Status messages are transmitted from the SADL radio to the JRE. The Data Link Response message is the SADL Radio’s response to the host initialization message, and contains 10 words.  These words confirm the JRE Initialization parameters to the JRE and these messages are sent periodically after the JRE Initialization message is received. The Data Link Status message contains information on possible radio failures. This message also provides the radio software version number. This message is sent periodically after the JRE Initialization message is received.Now, data link messages can be exchange between the SADL radio emulator and the JRE.  The UDP packet format consists of the standard UDP packet header, the message count, and the message data.  The message data is 70 bytes.  The first six bytes contain a cyclic redundancy check, a message identifier and traffic control and shaping information.  Link 16 messages will be sent to the JRE, specifically, the TMPG.  The TMPG converts SADL Link 16 messages to SADL TADIL J messages.  As indicated above, the TADIL J words are identical in both networks, only the TADIL J header is different.  Once the conversion is complete, the JRE will send the Link 16 TADIL J messages to the DMOC Common Connectivity Device (CCD), which will convert to the SISO-STD-002 format and transmit onto the DMOC common LAN.  SISO S Integration PlanThe SISO S messages will come from the DMOC F-16 UTD simulations, the A-10C simulations from remote sites, and from XCITE.  Consequently, the Link 16 data required by the SADL assets will require conversion to SADL and then conversion to SISO S for interoperability.  The SADL Radio Emulator will read the Transmitter/Signal/Transmitter PDU wrap, strip the DIS Signal PDU header, and send the TADIL J or K series message to the JRE.  The JRE will forward TADIL J messages, and convert K series messages to TADIL J and also forward these to the Common Connectivity Device (CCD).  The CCD will then add the SISO J format to the TADIL J messages and transmit onto the DMOC TDL WAN.  Consequently, when TADIL J messages are transmitted from the CCD to the JRE, the JRE will forward them to the SADL Radio Emulator, which will add the SISO S format and transmit them to SADL C2 assets.  The CCD will be configured such that only TADIL J messages required by the SADL assets will be sent to the JRE.  Also note that the SADL Radio Emulator will only reformat the TADIL J messages in the DIS SISO S format.  The HLA SISO S capability will not be part of this project; however, it will be a future capability request.Current StatusThe SADL Radio Emulator is still in progress.  The first test for exchanging messages between the emulator and the JRE is complete.  The next step is to generate SISO S messages from either A-10s or XCITE and send to the SADL Radio emulator to forward to the F-16, and also forward to the JRE for conversion and the CCD to reformat the messages into SISO J.  The first planned use for the SADL Radio Emulator is planned for Virtual Flag 10 -1.  The results of the use in VF will be published in subsequent papers.ConclusionsThe SADL Radio Emulator project will incorporate SADL messages into the DMOC tactical data link WAN.  This will make it possible to incorporate F-16 and A-10 assets such that tactical data link messages can be exchanged between the DMOC AWACS and F-16 or A-10s.  The enhancement will allow for increased C2 training for the warfighter.AcknowledgementsI thank the DMOC for sponsoring this paper.
