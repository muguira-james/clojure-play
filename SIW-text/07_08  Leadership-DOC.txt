There is a wide variety of groups working on extensions to the DEVS formalism, with several modeling tools based on these extensions. The goal of the study group will be to find a core of the DEVS formalism that is suitable for standardization of activities at the level of modeling. It will bridge the gap between existing simulation frameworks and modeling activities using a standard notation.  The DEVS SG will study the possibility of developing standards for a computer processable representation of DEVS that supports common understanding, sharing and interoperability of DEVS implementations. Computer processable forms include all forms of simulation and real-time execution as well as various forms of syntactic and semantic analysis.  INCLUDEPICTURE "http://www.sisostds.org/images/common/img_icon_new.gif" \* MERGEFORMATINET Distributed Debrief Control Protocol (DDCP)Chair:  Steve Monson 	The Boeing Company	steve.monson@boeing.com Vice Chair:   Steve PadillaSecretary:   Randy PitzThe goal of the DDCP Study Group is to evaluate industry and government interest in developing a distributed debrief control protocol standard.  The Study Group will evaluate  the potential for a standards product addressing interoperability between distributed debrief (AAR) systems from multiple sources.Event replay is a common element of debriefing systems.  Many tool vendors implement debrief event replay using a variety of techniques and possess unique capabilities meeting the specific needs of the program.  When these systems need to be integrated into a larger distributed debrief spanning multiple sites, problems arise due to a lack of an interoperable standard.  The distributed debrief in this case will often not leverage the rich capabilities each site has to offer, and only provide the bare minimum capability.  Existing debriefing capabilities can be maintained and enhanced while reducing integration and operating costs through the development of an interoperable protocol for distributed debrief.Boeing as well as other organizations have developed distributed debrief protocols of varying capabilities.  These same organizations have also indicated interest in a standards organization developing a distributed debrief protocol.  Live, Virtual, Constructive (LVC) Architecture interoperability SGChair:  Len Granowetter	MaK Technologies	lengrano@mak.comVice Chair:  Sam Knight	L-3 Communications                       HYPERLINK "mailto:snknight@link.com" snknight@link.com	Secretary: Michael O’Connor                      ITT                                              Michael.oconnor@itt.com	Mixed architecture systems are becoming increasingly commonplace, and simulation interoperability is a central issue.

These approaches would allow for or be based upon the transfer of rich data sets." "NASA recognizes that message-based communication, as opposed to reliance solely on shared data and synchronous communication, suggests significant opportunities. The question is not an “either HLA or DIS” question. We are asking “how best can we advance message passing in the twenty-first century?” The study may well lead to a “both an HLA and DIS answer” or something else entirely.""This suggests the need to consider how the next wave of simulation technology might address message-based systems, and how they will safely, robustly and flexibly support the full-life span of simulation products.

Low cost desktop computers with eight processors can be bought today for about $4K. Experts in multicore computing predict that the number-of-cores per chip will double every eighteen to twenty-four months. This means that in three to four years, desktop computers with 32 cores will be commonplace. By 2021, affordable desktop computers may offer more than a thousand processors. Applications designed to run serially will not benefit from the large numbers of processors that will be available. A new programming model will be required to take full advantage of the coming affordable massively parallel hardware architectures. Consequently, the multicore computing revolution has begun and warrants serious attention by the M&S community.A common discussion within the High Performance Computing (HPC) community that has been articulated many times over the past twenty years is the need for frameworks and programming abstractions that simplify the development of parallel applications without sacrificing performance or at the expense of requiring higher software development/maintenance costs. M&S systems have historically proven to be fitting applications for HPC because of the user-driven need for high-fidelity realistic models and/or scenarios with large numbers of entities. These applications range from physics-based continuous models (e.g., computational fluid dynamics) to the real-time and/or discrete-event modeling of military forces and their C4I systems operating within a Net-Centric Operational Warfare (NCOW) environment.While there has been much research and development in the area of parallel and distributed simulation over the past 20 years, recent examples of proposed open source parallel and distributed simulation architectures that address the multicore revolution include two relevant technical papers, known as: (1) the Open Modeling and Simulation Architecture (OpenMSA) and (2) the Open System Architecture for Modeling and Simulation (OSAMS).The interest of the proposed study group is to explore these architectures as well as other layered architectures and HPC technologies for M&S. The Open MSA, for instance, defines a top-to-bottom layered architecture, where each layer supplies a well-encapsulated technology that is necessary for supporting scalable processing on parallel and distributed computing systems. These layers were designed to work together to form a complete solution. Primary examples of technology layers identified in the OpenMSA are: (1) high-speed communications, (2) event management services, (3) time management algorithms, (4) a wide variety of miscellaneous utilities including support for containers, rollbacks, persistence, and mathematical algorithms, (5) integration with existing M&S standards such as HLA, DIS, TENA, and (6) potential integration with emerging standards such as NCES and other web-based service oriented architectures such as SRML and XMSF. One of the goals of the OpenMSA is to provide an architecture that can support, and potentially automate, integration with a wide variety of interoperability standards, including all relevant standards developed by SISO.SCORM – Simulation Interface Standards SG  Chair:  Brandt Dargue	The Boeing Company	brandt.w.dargue@boeing.comVice Chair:  Geoffrey Frank	RTI International	gaf@rti.orgSecretary:  Brent Smith		brents@ecsorl.comOne of the important challenges faced by designers and developers of learning, education and training   technology is how to integrate simulation-based learning experiences with SCORM environments. This problem has many aspects, both pedagogical and technical. A clear first step is to enable SCORM content or Runtime Environments to invoke and communicate with simulations in a standardized and interoperable fashion. Such "SCORM-Simulation Interface Standards" will lower the cost of integration, lead to tools that save designers and developers time and money and help simulation vendors develop reusable simulations and components. This Study Group will be joint between SISO and the IEEE Learning Technology Standards Committee (LTSC). INCLUDEPICTURE "http://www.sisostds.org/images/common/img_icon_new.gif" \* MERGEFORMATINET Target Data Transfer Protocol SGChair:         David Murray	Vice Chair: TBDSecretary:  Brian ButtersA Study Group (SG) for the development of a Target Data Transfer Protocol (TDTP) is being initiated.  A ‘target’ is defined in this sense to be any object that a sensor can detect; it includes military and non-military vehicles, through to electricity pylons.  Members of UK Industry have been working on this topic and have produced some preliminary output as part of their involvement in a group set-up by The Real-Time Data Company Ltd.. (refer to  HYPERLINK "http://www.TheRTDC.com/HTML/TargetDataStd.htm" http://www.TheRTDC.com/HTML/TargetDataStd.htm).  Work has been conducted in the Radar and EO/IR areas.  It is the intention in the near future to start work in the ESM and sonar/acoustic areas.  This SG will work to produce a TDTP that serves the needs of the modeling and simulation community.In a similar fashion to that experienced for Military Scenario Definition Language (MSDL), target data and associated tools have been non-standard and closely coupled to the simulation they support.  This close coupling severely limits the sharing of target data among the various simulations and stimulation activities that need target data.The modeling and simulation (M&S) community is in need of standards that support data exchange for existing and emerging systems, across the live, virtual, and constructive simulation domains.  This is of increasing importance, as data fusion applications require consistent information across several spectral areas for each target.To solve the above issue, the mission of the TDTP SG will be to verify the needs for standards in this area, evaluate any existing related standardization efforts, and cultivate a broad base of support across the simulation community for development of the TDTP product.Transfer of Control (TC) SG Chair:  Frank Hill	SDS International Inc.			fhill@sdslink.comVice Chair:  Patrick Merlet	Sparta	Patrick_Merlet@sparta.comSecretary:  VacancyThe Transfer Control SG has presented a tutorial on transfer ownership for DIS and HLA software developers and users based on the new 1278.1 transfer ownership design.

In addition military operations are no longer conducted by single services and a single national force.  They are likely to be conducted within a coalition or alliance such as NATO. This has led to a requirement for multinational interoperability and the development of standards in support of interoperability, such as the Multinational Interoperability Programme's (MIP) Joint Command, Control and Consultation Information Exchange Data Model (JC3IEDM). In particular, a Battle Management Language (BML) is required that enables expression and communication of military plans and orders across multiple national and coalition forces. It can be seen as a standard representation of a digitized commander's intent to be used for real forces, simulated forces, and for future robotic forces and it must also provide for situational awareness and a shared, common operational picture. A BML is particularly relevant in a network centric environment for enabling mutual understanding.Numerous papers have been published in the SISO C2 and M&S Services/C4I forum track in this area and discussion on this subject has led to the creation of a NATO M&S Coalition Battle Management Language (C-BML) Working Group (MSG 048).  The community is now ready to move forward to develop an appropriate standard based on initial Proof of Principle work in the US, France, Germany and other nations. It is however critical that an international approach be taken to the C-BML development efforts. The same issues that have driven the military forces of other nations to embark on programs of this type will be more cost effective if an internationally recognized standard can be developed. While C-BML focuses on the description of executable tasks and assigning these to military entities, Military Scenario Definition Language (MSDL) targets the initialization of simulation systems with the military scenario. MSDL allows the generation of the military scenario, which consists of the initial state of the military situation and planned actions. Therefore, C-BML and MSDL will be developed as separate Standards but form a close working relationship in their development process. C-BML, as envisioned by this Product Development Group will when developed and applied allow interoperability among coalition C2 systems and simulations. In developing C-BML a phased approach is envisaged. An initial specification based on current doctrines, use of the JC3IEDM and web services will be developed in Phase 1. Subsequent phases will expand to incorporate a tasking and reporting grammar and ontology. Core Manufacturing Simulation Data (CMSD) PDGChair:  Swee Leong	NIST	leong@cme.nist.gov	Vice Chair:  Frank Riddick	NIST	 HYPERLINK "mailto:Riddick@cme.nist.gov" Riddick@cme.nist.govSecretary:  Tina Lee	NIST	leet@cme.nist.govThis product defines a data interface specification for efficient exchange of manufacturing life cycle data in a simulation environment.

It is true that there are many different types of system that might be called COTS packages.  However, this work concerns itself with systems that fall under the discrete event simulation paradigm, i.e. simulated models of systems that change state at discrete points in time (scheduled events) or as a result of state changes (conditional events).  These state changes typically represent entities  (documents, patients, parts, trains, etc.) that pass through networks of queues and workstations (work queuing at a desk in an office, patients waiting to see a doctor, parts buffered for machining, trains waiting at a station, etc.)  CSPs support activities such as model building, experimentation, animation, visualization and reporting.  There are currently around 20 of these commercially available.It is important to note that the model/CSP technology is a fixed point.  Virtually every engineering faculty has some course on simulation modeling that uses one or more CSPs.  Engineers and analysts use these CSPs to build and maintain simulation models.  These CSPs therefore represent a significant investment.  Additionally, users of these CSPs are not software engineers – they are simulation modelers.  There is evidence to show that it is highly likely that any major changes to their methodology and technologies will result in the non-adoption of these proposed products.  It is therefore a major consideration of our work that any interoperability products that are developed are highly transparent in nature.Distributed Interoperability Simulation (DIS) PDG Chair:         James (Mark) McCall	Anteon  Corp, AFRL	        james.mccall@mesa.afmc.af.mil	Vice Chair  Bob Murray	The Boeing Co                     bob.murray@boeing.com		Secretary:  Rob Byers	Northrop Grumman              Robert.byers@ngc.comThe DIS PDG is developing a balloted revision to the IEEE DIS standard 1278.1 and 1278.1a to be designated 1278.1-200X.

Decisions requiring large investments and even affecting human lives are already based on simulation results.  As a consequence, the operational need exists not only to build new, but also to acquire and reuse existing models, simulations, and their components with a certain degree of confidence for the intended use. Unfortunately M&S products tend to get more and more complex, requiring more formal engineering processes, which include formal verification and validation processes.  V&V is the “price” for trustworthy M&S products.To solve this issue the GM-V&V SG’s primary objective will be to provide a path into the creation of an internationally accepted VV&A standard complementing the current VV&A PDG efforts (dedicated to an Overlay of the FEDEP) and in consistency with the VV&A PDG efforts and other existing developments.The final objective is to provide the international community with a methodology that not only embraces a wide variety of M&S products but also may provide a future common basis for the simulation community through the GM-V&V product.High Level Architecture (HLA) - Evolved PDG Chair:  Roy Scrudder	DMSO	roy.scrudder@dmso.milVice Chair (US):  Randy Saunders	JHU/APL	r.saunders@ieee.orgVice Chair (European):  Bjorn Moller	Pitch	bjorn.moller@pitch.seSecretary:  Katherine L.

In addition, many new potential HLA requirements have been identified based on feedback from the various domains and application areas that comprise the HLA user community. This PDG seeks to address these requirements via a formal open review of the IEEE 1516 series of specifications. As part of this process, the PDG will incorporate those aspects of the Interpretations Document and Dynamic Link Compatible HLA API that need to become part of the core standard.Link 11 A/B Simulation Standard Network (Link 11 A/B) PDG   Chair:  Joe Sorroche		DMOC/ASRCC	 HYPERLINK "mailto:joe.sorroche@kirtland.af.mil" joe.sorroche@kirtland.af.milVice Chair:  John Saicawalo		Lockheed Martin	john.saicawalo@kirtland.af.milSecretary:  Rob Byers		Northrop Grumman	Robert.byers@ngc.comThis product will be a SISO standard to define the methods to simulate a Link-11 A/B Network within a Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) or High Level Architecture (HLA) framework.This standard will have two parts, one that will describe extensions to the DIS standard and the second will detail a Base Object Model (BOM) to extend Federate Object Models (FOM) operating in the HLA framework. The standard shall detail implementation and usage methodologies in DIS and HLA as well as defining the data structures.

Wittman Jr.	Mitre Corp		rwittman@mitre.orgSecretary:  Ken Peplow	SAIC		kpeplow@ideorlando.orgThe Military Scenario Definition Language (MSDL) SG is being developed by OneSAF Objective System program to provide simulations with a mechanism for loading Military Scenarios. As a standard, MSDL is not being developed for simulation alone. The intent is for MSDL to define Military Scenarios that are independent of the application generating or using the scenario. To that end, MSDL is an XML based data interchange format that enables C2 planning applications to exchange the military portions of scenarios with Simulations and other applications.The scope to MSDL is bounded by the situation, defined at one instant in time, combined with the COA about to be taken in context to that situation. The intent is for MSDL to include that information which is either core or common to the situation and course of action of a military scenario.Real-Time Platform Reference FOM (RPR FOM) PDGChair:  Graham Shanks	BAE Systems		graham.shanks@baesystems.comVice Chair:  VacancySecretary:  Doug Wood	MäK Technologies		dwood@mak.comVersion 1.0 of this Reference Federation Object Model was the first SISO standard, capturing the functionality of IEEE 1278.1-1995.  RPR FOM 2.0, currently under development, will add the functionality of IEEE 1278.1a-1998.  The PDG will continue work towards readying the FOM and GRIM for community balloting.Simulation Reference Markup Language (SRML) PDG Chair:  Bob Lutz		JHUAPL		Robert.lutz@jhuapl.eduVice Chair:  Jane Bachman		NSWCDD Teams		jane.bachman@navy.milSecretary:  Curtis Blais		NPS	clblais@nps.eduSimulation Reference Markup Language (SRML) PDG is a product which has been in production since 2001 and has been used within the simulation community by several organizations. Experiences using SRML have been highlighted in several SIW papers as described in the SRML Study Group Final Report. SRML has already gone through an examination process by the World Wide Web Consortium for submission as a Note and has been accepted.The first step is to assemble the SRML product development team, to include members recognized as simulation engine developers and simulation data modelers. Next the team will develop a language specification that will include a description of the SRML concept and XML tag set for the language. Additionally, an SRML user guide will be developed. An engine specification will be developed to include a detailed description of the simulation engine object model and engine API reference.Verification, Validation & Accreditation Overlay to Federation Development (VV&A) PDGChair:  Simone Youngblood	DMSO	syoungblood@dmso.milVice Chair:  Susan Solick	TRADOC Analysis Center	 HYPERLINK "mailto:susan.solick@us.army.mil" susan.solick@us.army.milSecretary:  VacancyThe Verification, Validation & Accreditation Overlay to Federation Development (VV&A) PDG is developing a recommended practices guide outlining implementation methodologies for the VV&A of a federation.  IEEE 1516.3, Recommended Practices for HLA Federation Development and Execution Process (FEDEP) recognized VV&A as a key component of federation development and implementation to the extent that placeholders, or "hooks," were included in the FEDEP to support the development of a VV&A overlay.  The proposed VV&A guidance document will mirror the FEDEP, addressing overall VV&A methodology, roles and responsibilities, tasks, and resulting products.  It will be based on lessons learned and established approaches derived from the M&S community.  This guidance document will serve as the foundation for the assessment of credibility of a federation by addressing issues relating to establishing substantive interoperability, promoting reusability, and assuring composability.PRODUCT SUPPORT GROUPSProduct Support Groups (PSGs) will be established upon completion of a balloted SISO product, or SISO sponsored product, to offer continuity and a place for developers and users of the standards to ask questions, request explanations, seek support, or register change requests for subsequent versions of the product. The PSG takes responsibility for the product at Step 5 of the Balloted Products Development and Support Process (BPDSP).Base Object Model Specification (BOM) PSGChair:  Paul Gustavson	SimVentions, Inc.	pgustavson@simventions.comVice Chair:  Bob Lutz	Johns Hopkins Univ/APL	robert.lutz@jhuapl.eduSecretary:  Jane Bachman		NSWCDD TEAMS			      Jane.Bachman@navy.milThe BOM Product Support Group (PSG) supports the approved SISO-STD-003-2006 BOM Template Specification standard and the SISO-STD-003.1-2006 Guide for BOM Use and Implementation.
