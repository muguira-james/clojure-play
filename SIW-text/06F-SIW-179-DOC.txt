Core Manufacturing Simulation Data (CMSD) PDG MeetingSummary                            Prepared by Tina LeeTime: Sept 13, 2006, 7:00pm-9:00pmLocation: SIW Fall 2006/Holiday Inn, Orlando, FLPresiding Officers: Swee Leong (Chair), Frank Riddick (Vice Chair), Tina Lee (Secretary), and Peggy Gravitz (Technical Area Director).Attendees: Don Holmes (Imedia IT), James Hollenbach (SSI/OUSD (A&T)/SSE), Louis Hembree  (NRL), Bill Waite (Aegis Technologies), Farid Mamaghani (SimVentions), Peggy Gravitz (AEgis Technologies), Chris Rouget (SISO), Swee Leong (NIST), Frank Riddick (NIST), and Tina Lee (NIST).Highlights:The meeting was chaired by S. Leong. T. Lee was the secretary for this meeting.S. Leong briefed the attendees regarding the CMSD background information and status, the potential CMSD information model implementations, etc.F. Riddick presented an overview of the CMSD information model (CMSDIM). Copies of CMSDIM, Part 1 (draft version, dated September 13, 2006) were distributed at the meeting. An e-copy will be posted on the SISO SAC-PDG-CMSD discussions site.Major technical topics discussed in the meeting included:Does CMSDIM include CAD and design data? The CMSDIM does not specify CAD and design data directly; it provides a means to identify reference materials that are defined outside of the CMSDIM.What kind of applications, e.g., manufacturing, simulation, or SAP, will CMSDIM support? SAP is out of the CMSD scope.  CMSDIM supports both manufacturing and simulation applications, but the focus is on core manufacturing simulation data.Some ERP vendors are doing inventory control.  Is there overlap?  Yes, some.  Similarly, CMSDIM also overlaps with some existing standards, such as ISA 95, but each specification serves different purposes and viewpoints, and may support different manufacturing scenarios and activities.Boeing/Delmia application regarding NIST’s Machine Shop Information Model was also discussed. The approach of its implementation was briefed.From the production development standpoint, a suggestion was made to change the information model’s name to: Core Manufacturing Planning Data; the word “simulation” is easily ignored. No conclusion was arrived.Is the CMSD PDG aware of the OMG’s UML/XML activities? Yes, the PDG/Drafting Group (DG) has been communicating with OMG’s special interest groups.How does the CMSDIM relate one element to another element? The CMSDIM uses the concept of “context” to address this issue. Who are the potential CMSDIM users? Both application vendors and end users that are a part of the discrete part manufacturing domain are CMSDIM’s target users. Is it important to include shape/geometry information into CMSDIM? If not, how should assembly be handled? Shape data or geometry data is out of scope of CMSDIM.  They are not defined in CMSDIM, but can be referenced. An XML Schema version/mapping of CMSDIM will be generated from the UML version. XML Schema has limitations - not all UML modeling constructs can be converted into XML Schema. The PDG/DG is taking some of the limitations of XML Schema into account as the UML version of CMSDIM is being developed.  There was question raised concerning whether this was the best approach and whether XML based technologies were the best choice for developing CMSDIM. The PDG/DG believes data exchange using XML is the manufacturing simulation community’s preference.It was suggested to develop a “story” about manufacturing data and its interoperability problems in order to promote the CMSDIM. The PDG/DG is considering drafting a CMSDIM primer.It was suggested that the CMSDIM should ensure that it provides a mapping from real-world data to a fundamental conceptual domain for manufacturing.  The PDG/DG has been taking this approach in developing the CMSDIM by creating implementations of the CMSDIM draft versions and using them in integration projects with manufacturing using their real data.It was suggested that the PDG/DG collaborate with other standard developers in SISO to share/compare/contrast the methods used in developing their products.PAGE  PAGE  1
