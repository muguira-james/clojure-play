A PROPOSED COMMUNITY APPROACH TO AN END-TO-END LOGISTICAL SIMULATIONDavid PayneThe MITRE Corporation1820 Dolley Madison Blvd.McLean, VA 22101-3481703-883-6366dpayne@mitre.orgKeywords:HLA, Logistics Federation. ABSTRACT: Currently war games, training exercises as well as real-world operational planning are hampered by the lack of an integrated end-to-end, Joint and multi-service logistical simulation.  Instead, planners and players are expected to manually or mentally integrate the outputs of a number of deployment and sustainment models and simulations. Typically, there is no time to perform this integration, and, worse, the existing models and simulations often cannot be set up and run quickly enough to meet the exercise or planning schedule.  The result is that logistics are not considered in planning or exercise play, or are considered and dismissed at a cursory level. Then, later on in actual operations, difficulties arising from little or no logistical planning crop up, forcing replanning of the operation, or worse. There have been some scattered efforts to improve this shortfall in DOD and service simulation capability. However, due to the lack of an overall program with a long term strategy and multiyear budgetary support, these efforts have typically stalled, and in all cases have not tackled the true end-to-end scope of Joint Focused Logistics. CINC and service operational planners are now demanding better logistical planning tools for both deployment and sustainment of power projection forces. This demand offers the Joint logistical community a unique opportunity to ally their efforts to propose and then to manage and build an end-to-end federation of logistical simulations.  This discussion paper suggests ways to do this, and will hopefully generate community interest and participation within the SIW Log Forum.1. IntroductionIronically, at a time when more and more of the logistics community sees logistics as an integrated system of systems, defense logistics modeling and simulation capabilities are as fragmented and insular as ever. The current situation is typified by incomplete model coverage, numerous models and simulations still in use based on irrelevant or obsolete support concepts, poor human machine interfaces, slow turn execution times, poor real time support and little interoperability. This is a recurring shortfall identified in after action reports and player feedback from virtually every major war game and exercise held in the past few years.  Most recently, the Focused Logistics Operations Wargame (FLOW) identified shortfalls in logistical model and simulation support of the wargame as well as shortfalls in logistics model and simulation support for the staff elements in the games. In addition, the real world staff elements supporting the regional CINCs have also recently identified a number of logistics decision support needs, most of which could be satisfied by simplified access to an integrated suite of logistics models. Other current shortfalls include lack of opposing force log simulations, lack of leverage among the various entity level simulations (DIS, RPR, CCTT, Manned Simulators, SBA) to propagate systems level logistics modeling, and poor linkage of deployment and employment models. This last problem greatly impedes use of simulation in power projection operations planning and training. And finally, a general lack of effective programmatics impedes logistical simulation development and federation efforts in services, agencies and at the Joint level. Expected benefits of an effective logistics modeling and simulation federated effort include enhanced power projection capabilities resulting from leveraging mobility and sustainment in a predictable high performance system, a means to quickly provide CINC and service planners with logistical decision support tools, better defined and defendable programmatics, and, most importantly, the ability to practice Joint Focused Logistics.2. Imagining a Logistics FederationBoth the commercial and defense sectors increasing recognize logistics as a key enabler of success for the enterprise as well as being a complex system of systems.  This later view has led to a great deal of interest over the past two decades in analyzing distributed logistics functions as components of a larger system, and in enhancing the operation of that system through processing engineering and optimization. The commercial logistics sector has to date achieved more success than the defense logistics sector in both mapping and understanding their respective end to end logistics chains, and in honing their performance. Nonetheless, defense logistics, at least in the United States, has over the past few years become appreciative of the linkages of the defense logistics support chain, and is very interested in enhancing the operations of the overall logistics system.  That said, full acceptance and appreciation of logistics as an integrated system is still required throughout the defense logistics community and especially in related communities such as the operational and planning community and the acquisition community.  Slow progress has been made in getting the various areas of interest in logistics to see “the big picture”, but still not every area sees how their operations relate to the whole.2.1 Areas of InterestThe defense logistics chain stretches from the most forward individual combatants back to factory or mill supplying the component of a component of a weapons system.  In between are massive infrastructures of management, production and transportation, and the information systems that support them.  These form areas of interest in which the participants are acutely interested in the workings of their immediate part of the support chain but only marginally interested in the more distant components.  Note that this alone is a vast improvement generally attained over the past ten years—before that time most of the participants in one area of the support chain knew little about the rest of the chain and probably cared even less! By identifying these areas of interest we can gain an initial understanding of the models and simulations we would need to form an end to end logistics simulation federation.  So what are these areas?  My initial analysis suggests this chain of areas of interest stretches from one’s own research, development and acquisition systems through national level logistics, out to the area of operations up to the war fight itself and then through the opposing support and acquisition chain.  The complete set is:Simulation Based Acquisition (SBA) and Integrated Logisitcs Support (ILS)National logistics and selected portions of the commercial industrial baseStrategic mobilityTheater logisticsTheater war fightTactical war fight (entity level and virtual reality simulations)Opposing theater war fight (typically the same set of models used for friendly force modeling)Opposing force logistics (to include non-defense support infrastructure and supplier’s support chains)Opposing force mobilityForeign systems simulations and engineering models2.2 Current Coverage of Logistical ModelsCurrent models ands simulations cover a fair range of the areas of interest from national logistics out through the war fight models. However, they are not well linked, nor do they interact very well.  Thus the Air Force’s theater model may not impact operations in the Army’s model, and both typically operate oblivious to any Navy or Marine Corps operations running in their own model worlds. Note also that Simulation Based Acquisition is evolving slowing, with little apparent effort to including the logistical implications of the proposed systems operating as part of a defined force structure. Modeling of the opposing support chain is basically unsupported.  This seems a critical oversight in today’s world of power projection operations directed against typically isolated rogue nations.  Allowing combat operators to see, understand and target the opposing forces support chain seems to be an excellent way to quickly dominate an opponent with minimal loss of life on either side.  However, the old saying that you fight as you train holds true, and our war planners and operators are not trained on exploiting this key enemy weakness.  One notable development in the current suite of models is the WLTAE federation of a war fight model with a theater transportation model. WLTAE could provide a starting point for the development of a wider end to end logistics federation.  Figure 1 (below) is an initial attempt at inventorying existing models and simulations and relating them to the user areas of interest.  2.3 A Proposed Strategy for an End to End Logistics FederationThe SIW Logistics Forum should advocate a community-based approach to building an end to end logistics federation.  The forum should approach DOD Logistics Community Management (LCM) for support of such an effort.  Before this can be done, though, the log forum should have agreed to a general architecture for the components of an end to end logistics federation, as well as a finely honed argument of the need for such a forum and its worth.  If LCM support can be generated, service and agency support can then be sought, and at least some level of funding can be established. Thus within a year we can, if we choose, potentially start to make progress toward the goal of an end to end logistics federation.  Other things we would likely want to do to further this effort include:Leverage the WLTAE start at a log federation and anticipate and incorporate JWARS and JSIMS fielding, along with service components of these Joint models.Encourage LCM to build on the Army Log Process (“Rock Drill”) Model, expanding DLA and DFAS representation and modeling USN, USAF and USMC top level log processes interfacing with DLA and their internal national logistics infrastructures.Bring PORTSIM into the WLTAE federation, and add CONUS ELIST and develop an OPFOR ELIST to add the suite of models.Bring in RPR-FOM as base entity level simulation, and expand log play and log systems representation in RPR, leveraging the log forum’s DIS log protocol work where useful.Back a project for developing methodology and tools for rapid process modeling of opposing force support chains, which results in a model that conforms to end to end log federation.These actions should further the convergence of existing and emerging log models into a federation that models the entire support chain, as well as the opponents support chain.Figure 2 (above) illustrates a proposed initial logistics federation architecture, which would provide at least rudimentary coverage of the end to end logistics process supporting a Joint force’s prosecution of a major theater war. Note that the opposing logistics support chain is not represented in any model known to the author.  However, this aspect of the overall war fight could be rapidly modeled in most cases using a commercial process modeling tool. This exploits the current situation were most opponent nations have very limited and under developed support infrastructures.  Emergent potential opponents with well-developed or complex industrial infrastructure could be modeled in greater detail by appropriate threat analysis agencies.The Way AheadThe initial steps toward accomplishing the plan outlined above include:Complete the mapping of existing & developmental simulations that may be of use in the proposed federation.Develop a Log Forum vision that fully articulates a DOD end to end log simulation strategy, including service, agency, ally and partner participation (i.e. an open federation approach). Take an architecture approach, which can be built upon incrementally. Elicit support, both political and programmatic. Start the federation process, building to the architecture to allow parallel and disjointed development leading to the eventual end to end log forum.3. ConclusionThe current state of log model coverage and interoperability is insufficient for training, planning and operational support.  The requisite component models do however largely exist. WLTAE is an example of what can be done, and a good starting point.  The log modeling and simulation community should seek support from their service and agency sponsors and DOD Log Community Management to plan and initiate development of an end to end log federation.  The ISW Log Forum can play a vital role in advancing and managing this process.Author BiographiesDAVID PAYNE is a Lead Modeling and Simulation Engineer in the Operations Research Department of The MITRE Corporation.
