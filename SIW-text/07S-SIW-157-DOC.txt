Name of Forum or Group:  ChairSwee LeongVice ChairFrank RiddickSecretaryTina LeeObjectives for this Workshop:To provide a technical overview of the released draft document.To provide a progress report on the CMSD PDG activity.Comments and Recommendations:Discuss data modeling, methodology, business process modeling, and other standards effort that might be relevant to CMSD.Accomplishment: Collaborated with Volvo Cars Corporation and Chalmers University of Sweden to input manufacturing resource data to Enterprise Dynamic simulation model via an XML document based on the CMSD specification.  The Enterprise Dynamic simulation software is used to model the Volvo car body paint assembly process.Collaborated with Geer Mountain Software to extend the distribution functions such that the specification would accommodate and be able to support various commercial simulation software on the market.Next step: 1. to extend the CMSD specification to include plant layout information. The plant layout specification will be based on Simulation Data Exchange (SDX) specification from UGS Software.plan to present a tutorial on simulation in manufacturing with the application of CMSD Information Model at the 2007 Fall SIW.collaborate with Volvo Trucks and Chalmers University to test the CMSD specification with Plant Simulation software from UGS. The manufacturing data to be exchanged are yet to be defined.  The UGS’s Plant Simulation software is used to model the Volvo truck engine manufacturing assembly operations.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)7Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)7Peak attendance (including joint sessions)7Total papers presented“No-show” presentationsOther presentations and panel discussionsRecommended Reading List nomination:                  2007 SPRING SIW OUTBRIEF FORM
