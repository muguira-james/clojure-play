The effort is focused in improving procedures necessary to request and receive assistance in response to real world disaster and other critical events.1. The Joint Modelling and Simulation Centre in the Italian Defence.The Centro Interforze Modelli e Simulazione Operativa (CIMSO), the Joint Operational Modelling and Simulation Centre was established in 2001 and currently constitutes the centre of excellence on M&S matters in the Italian Ministry of Defence (IT MOD).Currently it operates in the Joint Operations Headquarters of the IT MOD.1.1 The military simulationNATO has categorized simulations into three types: live, virtual and constructive. (See Table 1.1)A live simulation involves real people operating real equipment, a virtual simulation involves real people using simulated equipment, a constructive simulation involves simulated people operating simulated systems.Real people stimulate (make inputs) to such simulations, but are not involved in determinig the outcomes.

Besides, a number of NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) specific tools are available in order to support and interface JTLS.In JTLS simulation data are highly aggregated; managed simulated units are usually built at battalion/company level, but with the possibility to use also High Resolution Units (HRU) in order to model Special Forces or other teams, while terrain is modelled at low resolution as a matrix of hexagons few kilometres width .The main areas of responsibility of CIMSO are:- updating, running and implementing of joint simulation systems;- coordinating, at joint level, studies and activities related to simulation systems evolution; - supporting training, at joint level, in simulated environments;- running simulation activities, at joint level, to support planning, operational analysis, operations. 2.	Simulation based inter-agency training in South East Europe.On 9 October 2000 the South Eastern Europe Defence Ministerial (SEDM) process agreed to establish a South Eastern Europe Simulation Network (SEESIM) in order to integrate various SEDM initiatives through a series of exercises supported by simulation. [2]2.1 The South Eastern Europe Simulation NetworkThe purpose of SEESIM is to promote co-operation, co-ordination and interoperability among the SEDM nations and the SEDM initiatives, among the others, the South Eastern Europe Brigade (SEEBRIG), the Engineering Task Force (ETF), the Experts' Group on Defence-Military Support for WMD Counter proliferation, Border Security, and Counter terrorism (CBSC) through effective use of computer modelling and simulation (M&S).The first SEESIM Exercise Computer Assisted Exercise (CAX)/Command Post Exercise (CPX) distributed simulation took place on December 2002 in Greece, supported by USA. It was based on a scenario with multiple earthquakes. Remote sites were established in SEDM nations and at SEEBRIG Headquarters. Italy participated with an officer from CIMSO as observer. 2.2 SEESIM 04 Exercise scenario and purposeThe second SEESIM Exercise (SEESIM 04) was conducted in November 2004 from the Atatürk Wargaming, Simulation and Cultural Centre of the War Colleges Command in Istanbul where the Exercise Control Group Main(ECG Main) was located. [3] (See Figure 2.1)Turkey hosted the Computer Assisted Exercise (CAX) direction whose staff included representatives of MODs and experts from civilian agencies of SEDM nations. Exercise Control Group Forward (ECG Fwd) where established in remote sites in Italy, at the Simulation Centre, and in Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Macedonia, Romania, Slovenia, Turkey (in Ankara). Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro, and Uzbekistan attended as observers. (See Figure 2.2) EMBED PowerPoint.Slide.8  Figure 2.1 - Nations participating in SEESIM 04 EMBED PowerPoint.Slide.8  Figure 2.2 – The Exercise ArchitectureSEEBRIG, whose Headquarters where located in Costanta, Romania, during the CAX deployed an engineer cell in Istanbul.Italian ECG Fwd in Rome was manned by a small staff of less than ten persons belonging to the Joint Operations HQ (Simulation Centre and other branches) and from the Presidency of the Council of the Ministers /Civil Protection Department. Some national ECG Fwds were also supported by US technical experts and Swedish civil emergency experts. The ECG Main in Istanbul was manned by approximately 50 persons from different nations, with a majority of  Turkish personnel and supporting nations’ staff . Italy participated deploying a liaison officer.International organisations’ representatives from the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA), the International Federation of Red Cross, the NATO Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Co-ordination Centre (EADRCC), the Stability Pact/Disaster Preparedness and Prevention Initiative and the Regional Arms Control Verification Implementation Assistance Centre (RACVIAC) took part to the exercise at the inter-agency cell level.Exercise scenario was based on a series of terrorist attacks in South East Europe Countries and focused on handling the consequences of terrorist attacks, including rapid deployment, civil emergency management, protection of civilians and humanitarian assistance. Italian main events to be played were terroristic attacks at the main railways stations in Rome and Milan(See Figure 2.3 and Figure 2.4)Figure 2.3  Milan central railway station, contaminated area (exercise)Figure 2.4 – Simulated on site response to attacks with “dirty bombs” at the central railway stations in the city of MilanThe purpose of the exercise was to enhance the procedures of national and regional co-ordination, co-operation, and mutual assistance among the nations of SEDM in the face of devastating terrorist attacks. The aim of the exercise was to:• respond to the consequences of a series of terrorist attacks;•	exercise national and regional civil-military organisations in South Eastern Europe;• promote application of internal procedures and co-ordination among appropriate national civil and military organizations;• present multiple and complex problems to participants in a short period of time;• offer challenges to decision makers and their decision making processes;• test and evaluate emergency response communication and co-ordination procedures;• avoid expenses associated with moving large numbers of participants and equipment through distributed simulation;• enhance national and regional simulation capabilities.2.3 SEESIM 06 Exercise participation and focusThe third exercise in the South-Eastern Europe Simulation Network project was conducted on 08-17 November 2006. co-hosted by Romania and Macedonia, supported by US and Sweden . [4]A new CAX architecture was tested, with two main ECGs, one in Bucharest, in the General Staff Simulation Training Centre, located inside the National Defence University in Bucharest and one at the Simulation Centre of the Military Academy, in Skopje. As usual, in each participating Country and at SEEBRIG HQ, ECG Fwds were activated  in order to exercise their emergency operations centres (EOC) generally manned by civilian and military staff. Ukraine joined the exercise as full member while Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Moldova were invited as observers.  Other participants included international organizations related to disaster relief operations as in SEESIM 04. Compared with the previous SEESIM edition, the new scenario was more realistic. Instead of multiple disasters, at the same time, in every Country, a couple of large-scale natural disaster events (flooding in Romania and earthquakes in Macedonia).Scenario themes included also non-civil protection issues like non-proliferation issues, border security, criminal activity and potential terrorist threats.Exercise Edition 2006 focused, more than on national civil-military cooperation, on the international aspects of coordination of inter-operability, by testing procedures for timely information exchange, humanitarian assistance, consequence management and disaster response operations.2.4 The regional and national training objectives Training objectives at the regional level included: •	practice and improvement of standard procedures  and timely information exchange between national and regional coordination centres in order to train national EOC and SEEBRIG HQ;•	testing and improving regional processes, including information management, regional communication flow, humanitarian assistance coordination, consequence management and disaster response operations;•	promotion of national and regional preparedness and cooperation between civil and military emergency planning officials in an effort to counteract potential future terrorist or Chemical, Biological,  Radiological and Nuclear and (CBRN) proliferation activities or mitigate effects of disaster.Italian national training objectives included:•	identification and exercise of rapid procedures for involvement in emergency situations;•	review and revision of planning procedures in decision-making process;•	identification and exercise of new tasks to be performed after a terrorist action;•	enhancing cooperation with civil-emergency agencies, national and international;•	training of nucleus staff personnel to react in emergency situations;•	identification the necessary alert status of the units in rapid reaction involvement3. The inter-agency cooperationCollecting data for building the Italian Civil protection units’ simulation data base required a inter-agency work of a technical team of experts from different backgrounds and expertise composed by representatives from the Department of the Civil Protection, the Ministry of Interiors, the State Police, the Carabinieri (Military Police) and the MOD Joint Operations HQ.3.1 Civil emergency planning organisational structure and inter-agency modellingAccording to the Italian legislative framework Civil Emergency Planning in Italy comprises both Civil Protection and Civil Defence. The organisational structure is based on one side on the Civil Protection Department (PROCIV) of the Presidency of the Council of the Ministers and on the other side on the Ministry of the Interior Department of Fire and Rescue Services and Civil Defence.The primary role of Civil Protection is to protect lives, integrity, property, buildings and the environment from damage or possible damage caused by natural or manmade disasters. The primary aim of Civil Defence is to increase the country’s preparedness for coping with major emergencies and crises, including war.The objectives of Civil Defence are to ensure the continuity of government action, to maintain law and order, to mobilise and co-ordinate the use of nationalresources (energy, labour, productive capability, food and agriculture, raw materials, telecommunications, etc.) and to co-ordinate alarm and rescue services, which are aimed at reducing the consequences of disasters.The Italian administrative organization comprises municipalities, provinces and autonomous provinces,  regions and autonomous regions.The municipalities carry out civil protection  activities, mainly relaying on volunteers’ organizations if the magnitude of the emergency does not require the Prefect’s involvement (provincial level).The provinces are responsible for forecasts and prevention in accordance with national and regional programs. In each province, a government-appointed prefect supervises the implementation of Civil Emergency actions.The regions have a planning/monitoring function and a coordination role in case of an inter-provincial emergency.The Chief of Civil Protection has the primary responsibility for the Civil Protection and chairs the Comitato Operativo della Protezione Civile (Operational Committee of the Civil Protection), composed by the representatives of the MOD Joint Operations HQ, the Carabinieri (Military Polic), the Ministry of the Interiors with the State Police, the Fire fighters National Corps, the Ministry of the Health, the Transportation, the Forest Corps, the Red Cross, and others. (See Figure 3.1)(Crisis management cell is different in Civil Defence emergency, other than civil protection).SEESIM exercises are supported by JTLS. tool whosespectrum of applications extends from Combat to Non-Combat Military Operations (Operations Other Than War).JTLS is used to model even civil units (Fire fighters teams, Civil Protection volunteers, Medical teams, Search and Rescue teams, airplanes, ships, buses) as well as military support units (engineer units, logistic convoys, helicopters, air transport, amphibious ships, fast patrol boats, etc.).Figure 3.1 Composition of the Emergency Operations Centre for Civil ProtectionThe command chain of Italian units in the SEESIM simulation data base reflected the composition of the forces in real world, with a majority of civil units compared with the number of military units, (mostly support units like army engineer, military helicopters or transportation airplanes, military amphibious ships, Carabinieri and NBC teams) (See Figure 3.2). Modelling was limited to units that might have been involved in scenario events, primary resources at the local level (in the cities of Rome and Milan) and central resources managed directly by the Italian EOC in Rome.Figure 3.2 – JTLS simulated Fire fighters, Police and Medical units3.2 Exercise procedures and reporting systemItaly identified as national focus areas:• 	the improvement of the existing frame of cooperation between Civil Protection Agency, Ministries, and other agencies in case of civil emergency;• 	the training of military and civil personnel in planning and responding to emergencies in national events, abroad concurrency, using national legislation and procedures;•	the training of the national organization in case of CBRNE operations, terrorist attack, or illegal traffic of materials and human beings.Procedures that were exercised during the exercise included request for assistance, offer of assistance, coordination of responses, treatment and evacuation of casualties, urban search and rescue, contain and control fires, clearing transportation routes of debris, containment and clean up of oil spill, mitigation of nuclear effects, crowd control, mitigation of flood effects, evacuation of personnel and animals, temporary shelter for personnel and animals, decontamination of victims, equipment and infrastructure, NBC reconnaissance, humanitarian assistance, border security, counter-terrorism and counter-proliferation tasks. During CAX execution the simulation system was fast forwarded at the end of each CAX day so that game time was ready to start the next day’s operations as there was no night shift.EOCs had to plan for events to take place during the night and provided them to their ECG-Fwds.Operators needed to build and send those orders before the end of operations that day. Those orders were executed up to the time of the next day. Country Site Managers had to prepare an update situation report (SITREP) each morning for the trainingaudience (national EOC) telling them what has happened during the night.ECGs were connected by a dedicated information web  infrastructure (intranet) and by the simulation network.On the contrary, sharing of information among national EOC of different Countries and International Organizations’ cell was based on commercial means of communications: e-mail and faxes and used CMEP [5] reports messages format. A control number added to the written report message facilitated identification. The same report control number is also the subject of the e-mail forwarding the CMEP form as an attachment.  EMBED PowerPoint.Slide.8  Figure 3.3 – Exercise Information FlowAll formatted reports originated by an EOC had to be numbered in order to permit tracking by the EOC and the ECG.Five reports, specified in CMEP Handbook, plus a Coordination Report were used: Notification of Disaster, Request for Assistance, Offer of Assistance, Acceptance of Offer, Situation Report.Coordination Report contains information about delivery instructions, air over flight requests and permissions, border crossings, customs instructions, and similar types of information The following are examples of the numbering system:Notification of Disaster, Romania	     N-RO-001Request for Assistance, Romania	     R-RO-001Offer of Assistance, Bulgaria         	O-BU-001Acceptance of Offer, Romania	     A-RO-001Situation Report, Romania		     S-RO-001Coordination Report, Bulgaria	     C-BU-001Notification of Disaster, Slovenia	     N-SI -001Request for Assistance, Slovenia	     R-SI -001Offer of Assistance, Bulgaria	O-BU-002Acceptance of Offer, Slovenia	     A-SI-001Coordination Report, Slovenia	     C-SI-001Each report had to reference the report that caused it to be generated (except Notification); ie, an Acceptance must reference the Offer it is responding to.Example: An Offer from Bulgaria responding to a Request from Romania will show O-BU-001/REF: R-RO-001.4. Considerations from the lessons learned In SEESIM exercises, according to the mode of participation, besides the major natural disaster events scripted in the Master Scenario Events List (MSEL) every Country played with the hypothesis of terroristic attacks and accomplished the management of emergency by activating a national centre for crisis management.A major goal in the exercises was to explore the national and regional processes for responding to crisisand foster communications and development of standardized operating procedures, thus preparing national EOCs for requesting and providing assistance, in prioritising responses to assistance requests and timely responding with delivered support. 4.1 The after action reviewAnalysts/Observers were generally from civil protection agencies, located within the exercise control group main and in each national ECG Fwd. They provided daily feedback to ECG Main on exercise play issues, conducted the after-action reviews and developed lessons learned.After action review slides outlined, from the national point of view, as Sustain, those processes that were considered to work well and should be continued and with Improve those processes to be changed or improved in order to get a better benefit.Taking into consideration the fact that five of the SEDM nations are European Union members and that also others in real world disaster emergencies rely on EU assistance, Civil Protection experts feel a need to improve the realism in the exercise operational framework with an active role of EU Monitoring and Information Centre (EU MIC) and by using means of communications like in real world, e. g. radio system.In the Italian EOC, located by the JOHQ/Simulation Centre, representatives of PROCIV, officers of the Ministry of the Interior, State Police, Carabinieri (Military Police) and officers of MOD JOHQ have been working together.PROCIV, through its experts and the Site Manager provided guidance and technical direction of the exercise for the Italian side.The Italian JOHQ Simulation Centre basically provided the managment of the JTLS model through a simulation operator while a liaison officer and a MSEL tracker were deployed at the ECG Main.4.2 Inter-operability and communication aspectsThe aim of the exercise, the scenario and the exercise design provided the participants a valuable experienceDuring the exercises military commands and civilian emergency agencies were working close together thus getting used to inter-operability and cooperation (Civil-military cooperation at national level).National EOCs of SEDM Countries worked together requesting, offering and managing international resources (international interoperability).Italian EOC deployed national resources abroad (See Figure 4.1) and also managed assistance units coming from foreign EOCs thus facing problems related to the  inter-operability of the different teams and equipmentsIt was evident that teams inter-operability guidelines are needed among the participating Countries.Figure 4.1 – Simulated Italian post-disaster humanitarian assistance operations.The liaison among the national EOCs was realized through the exchange of messages of communication of events and requests of assistance, written according formatted protocols and sent via e-mail or fax. Telephone communications were not heavily used. Besides, daily, videoconference among all the national ECG Fwds gave the opportunity to Site Managers for outlining the critical features and the points of force of the activity on going.During the CAX execution, national EOCs – as often in real life cases – were not able to use command & control systems.This is in fact because every nation crisis management centre might have available – possibly – its own national C2 system, but probably only for the military and, besides, generally not joint but single service oriented. C2I systems are not always available to civil protection agencies. National EOCs (Training audience) used only e-mail, fax, telephone and GIS tools and maps of the area of interest.As a consequence, the simulation network was used more extensively like a command and control system available for the ECGs (See Figure 4.1).    4.3 Simulation support to emergency responseSimulation technology gave an effective support to the needs concerning the scenario and the implementation of the training audience’ decisions. But, in real life (see Katrina or Tsunami examples) Disaster Relief operations, M&S does not seem to be used as time available for deploying in theatre is very short, in the range of hours, days and weeks. There are simulation tools with potential to support this type of operations, e.g. “planning of forces” and “planning of force movement”. The reason, why these potentials are not fully operable and not used at the moment may be that there was no user requirement until now. Humanitarian assistance seems to be a different use case for simulation not only in the training and exercise domain but also within the planning and analysis areas as time available before deploying units to operations theatre is in the range of days, weeks and months.Generally, Italian Civil Protection, as a coordination agency, more than on its own resources - relays firstly on a well structured bottom–up organisation based mainly on local forces and progressively  (depending on the events’ magnitude) increasing level: from municipality /province/region/state resources. (See Figure 4.2)Thus resources involved in a Civil Protection scenario can range from local volunteers’ NGOs to other administrations’ teams and finally to military units.It seems that it is not frequent for Civil Protection the situation in which – at the same time - a great number of units are deployed in a very large theatre. The user might probably get even more benefits from training tools able to use efficient models with accurate prototypes and high resolution geo-spatial data simulating activities in environments characterized by physical phenomena evolving in the space with time like e.g. CBRN contamination in built up areas, water flooding in a valley or evacuation from an island under volcanic eruption.Figure 4.2 Resources activation and management at different levels Additional benefits might also be achieved by a more detailed definition of civilian units prototypes and functionalities.The need to look in to details on the local situation, in a specific event management (e.g. contamination of a small populated area) would require the possibility to switch from the regional to the local scale as using a "magnifying glass".[6]5.
