Goals include: (1) to communicate basic concepts and plans to the broader community, and give a sense of how the various efforts fit together, and (2) to relate the new efforts to currently used methodologies and reference standards.  Workshop Arrangements: Continue to encourage presenters to get presentations in on time, especially if they use animation or movies, sound tracks, etc, that may involve separate files, or otherwise tend to be brittle when ported/copied.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)25Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)35Peak attendance (including joint sessions)35Total papers presented13“No-show” presentations1 lateOther presentations and panel discussions0Recommended Reading List nominations (including previous nominations):04S-SIW-03504S-SIW-030  /*new*/04S-SIW-09304S-SIW-050
