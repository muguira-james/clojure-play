Computers, Communications and intelligence (C4I) systems poses training problems due to the cost and complexity of conducting training exercises with the systems.  By connecting the digital devices with the simulations used to run Computer Assisted Exercises (CAX), warfighters can train with their real world command and control systems without having to deploy to field locations.  In addition, the simulation of the battlefield environment also provides an experimental proving ground for assessing the effectiveness of the command and control process in terms of information overload, situational awareness, and communications. The Communications Electronics Command (CECOM) through their Program Manager (PM) for Combat Identification and the US Army Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation Command (STRICOM) developed the Situational Awareness Tactical Internet Data Server (SATIDS) to support training and research into the first generation of tactical situational awareness displays for use at the Company, Platoon and combat vehicle level.  SATIDS can be used to integrate these digital Command and Control (C2) devices with wargame simulations by monitoring Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) information and generating appropriate Variable Message Format (VMF) messages.  Once these messages are generated, the FBCB2s can communicate situational awareness information about all members of an exercise (both virtual devices and Semi Automated Forces). SATIDS also functions to model the delays associated with the tactical Internet as a result of the message traffic load among all systems (both voice and data) during a battle. These delays were modeled stochastically and emulate the effects of all members of a particular net by the digital devices for all applicable systems. SATIDS makes use of a modular architecture utilizing SAF libraries and a government provided VMF parser.  SATIDS has been integrated into the Fort Hood SIMNET facility to support troop training. Additional plans call for SATIDS to facilitate integration of all Army Tactical Command and Control Systems (ATCCS) with simulations as well as expanding the modeling of communication net loading to include dynamic loading.1. IntroductionThe introduction of digital command and control systems has changed the way training is conducted and altered the mechanics of monitoring and recording the messages transmitted during training exercises.  The fielding of the Field Artillery’s command and control system, the Tactical Fire Direction System (TACFIRE), in the late 1970s provided both challenges and opportunities for trainers.  The challenge was devising a way to non-intrusively monitor and evaluate unit and personal performance when the radio transmissions were digital and directed to specific terminal addresses.  The opportunity came from the fact that communications were now in the form of standard formatted messages that could be recorded, parsed, sorted, and time stamped. The training problems associated with the new digital message systems were also hampering the accurate testing and evaluation of the TACFIRE system prior to fielding.  The solution was the integration of commercial mini-computers with the tactical communications system through the use of special purpose modulators/ demodulators (Modems) that operated on the Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) protocols used by the TACFIRE system.  This integration of real world systems with commercial computer equipment opened the door for using general-purpose commercial computers to stimulate the tactical systems.  The ability to record and store the messages in a database allowed the evaluators to perform a detailed analysis of the unit actions from the formatted messages that were recorded during an exercise. The use of C4I systems, commercial computers and simulations for both the training and analytical domains has been developed and exploited during the past several years. The US Army Simulation Training and Instrumentation Command (STRICOM), through the Advanced Distributed Simulation Technology II (ADST II) program supported by SAIC, has developed modules that integrate tactical situational awareness systems such as Appliqué, and subsequently FBCB2, with virtual and constructive simulations. The Force Protection Experiment III linked Appliqué with manned simulators and the ModSAF simulation system through the ADST II developed Appliqué Interface using the Tactical Internet Model (TIM) and Internet Controller (INC) model. This experiment demonstrated that computer simulations could stimulate tactical devices and increase the ability of soldiers to use situational awareness to accomplish their missions.   The Appliqué Interface functions by converting the simulation’s message passing Protocol Data Units (PDU) into the language used for tactical C2 devices, the Variable Message Format (VMF) tactical messages. The messages were transmitted via standard commercial networks using the Ethernet communications protocol.  The connection between devices can be set to reflect a perfect communications channel between the devices used at the echelons of platoon and below.  Experiments using this model provided realistic communications at the Company and Platoon level.  Subsequently, the PM for Combat Identification sponsored the Virtual Integration Exercise that focused on a joint combined arms exercise that included a Cavalry Squadron conducting screening operations, supported by USAF F-16 aircraft. The exercise identified the need to replicate the electronic environment and to model the delays normally experienced over the SINCGARS and EPLRS radio network.  To provide this more realistic model, the Situational Awareness Tactical Internet Data Server (SATIDS) was developed.   SATIDS incorporates the functionality of the TIM and INC while also modeling the delays of the tactical Internet. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the training applications and the benefits that can be gained by using the SATIDS to integrate simulations and C4I systems in a team-training environment.2. Team Training StrategyTeam and unit training has been a major concern in the US Armed Forces for many years.  Team training is defined as training multiple individuals to carry out cooperative tasks.  Normally, the soldier receives training in his individual tasks during Basic Training at an Army Training Center (ATC).  The soldier then progresses to Advanced Individual Training (AIT) where job-specific training is conducted, along with some limited cooperative training.  Due to time and funding constraints, the soldier is only partially trained when he departs the Training Center for his first tactical unit, and must be trained to proficiency at the unit.  The US Army changed their strategy for unit training in the mid-1970s from a lock-step formal schedule to a flexible goal oriented process.  The old system relied on an Annual Training Test (ATT) or Annual Service Practice (ASP) to determine the readiness status of its Battalions, and the training proficiency of the subordinate units, the companies/batteries, platoons, and squads/sections.  The results of this annual test were used to structure training programs for the following year.The goal-oriented program was a substantial change geared to continuous improvement in the collective training posture.  Goal-oriented training focuses on frequent informal evaluations of crew proficiency based on a list of tasks that are appropriate for each unit’s mission.  Since there is no need to have a unit stationed in a tropical climate practice Artic survival techniques, the list is tailored to reflect the mission critical tasks for each unit.  These informal evaluations are based on a published task, condition, and standard.  The task describes precisely what the team or unit is required to accomplish, while the standard provides a measurable, well-defined outcome.2.1 Team Training ImplementationThe problem that remained was how to allow the units to practice the tasks without endangering themselves or the community around them. The limited size of the live training ranges and the extended range and lethality of modern munitions precluded large-scale realistic exercises at most training areas. For the unit headquarters, command post exercises (CPX) were adequate, however, the cost of deploying the tactical communications infrastructure to support these exercises is often a limiting factor.  For the company and platoon exercise, new techniques were required that would allow training without taking the combat vehicles out of the motor pool. The US Army has been using armored vehicle simulators since the 1980s first with Simulation Network (SIMNET) program and more recently, the Close Combat Tactical Training (CCTT) Program to provide realistic training to the crews, and to allow training exercises with an entire battalion operating their vehicles in a single exercise.  These simulators use a complete Synthetic Natural Environment that includes the electronic environment and the use of simulated communications networks.  This allows a complete exercise to be conducted entirely in simulation, or use a combination of manned simulators and computer generated forces.2.2 Combat Vehicle Simulators The combat vehicle simulators provide the crew members (gunner, driver, and vehicle commander) realistic views of the simulated battlefield and simulated communication equipment to allow them to operate the vehicles exactly as they would on open terrain.  The simulation can use digital terrain from the unit’s home station where they normally train, or the simulations can use digital terrain from any location where the unit may be required to deploy.  This multiple terrain capability also allows the unit to perform mission rehearsals and to become familiar with the environment of the country where they may be deployed.  The realistic digital terrain is linked to the communication simulations so that the effects of the terrain realistically degrade the radio range.  Several activities have begun to use Personal Computer (PC) based simulators to supplement the SIMNET and CCTT full mission simulators due to the requirement to train away from the fixed training sites.  The Army Training Center at Vyskov in the Czech Republic uses these low-cost PC based simulators for their armored unit training, replicating the T-72 Tanks, and their BVP-1 and BVP-2 fighting vehicles.  The Czech Army is acquiring an additional set of these simulators and will double the number of simulators used for these exercises.  2.3 Aircraft  Simulators The US Army also uses a similar approach to provide training for the Close Air Support Aviation units.  The helicopter simulators are linked together using DIS or HLA protocols, and can join exercises with ground forces being conducted at any of the training sites using a Wide Area Network (WAN).  This allows the helicopter crews to get realistic training in providing fire support of ground operations in a manner that is not possible on any of the existing training ranges.  This also forces the aircrews to react appropriately to the ground threat forces or risk being “killed“ by the antiaircraft fires from the opposing forces.  As with the CCTT simulators, the other forces on the battlefield can be either other manned simulators being operated by soldiers at one or more locations, or computer generated forces.  The use of computer-generated forces is a tremendous labor saving device, allowing a unit to operate in concert with adjacent units, without having to staff the adjacent units for the exercise.  The same thing is true for the opposing forces, with computer-generated forces supplementing the humans who are setting up the opposing force operations.  A key factor in the integration of these air and ground simulators is the ability to integrate the tactical C2 systems and force the units to use their organic communication assets to implement the coordination of fires.3. The Training AudienceThe training audience at the Battalion level is the commander and staff, who use their organic tactical C2 systems to communicate with the company commanders and the platoon leaders who are operating out of manned simulators.  At the company and below level, the training audience is the entire complement of soldiers who use the C2 devices.  This training audience includes the crews of all the organic and supporting combat vehicles, as well as the Artillery and supporting Aviation units.  The typical slice of a Maneuver Battalion is shown in figure 1. EMBED PowerPoint.Slide.8                                    Figure 14. Maximizing use of limited time for trainingThe amount of time that is available for field training exercises is usually limited, and every effort must be made to take maximum advantage of each hour of time at the exercise/live training area, and to take maximum advantage of each live round fired, or kilometer of vehicle movement.  With the current curtailment of live training, more and more emphasis is placed on using training simulations and simulators to supplement the live training. To maximize the value of field training time, simulators are used to identify shortcomings in training proficiency, and training is scheduled to specifically address those shortcomings.  Where possible training simulations or simulators are used to provide the training platform.  Many Team or collective tasks require situations that are difficult to simulate at the home station, or on the live fire ranges.  An example of this situation is the training of a tank platoon on tasks that require fire and maneuver. The combat situation will require the coordination of fires between the tanks and other fire support assets, in addition to the coordination of locations and movement.  The tank commanders and gunners must be able to effectively engage the enemy targets prior to being engaged by the enemy.  In a realistic training engagement, the soldiers must be forced to contend with the situation where the targets shoot back. The success depends, to a large part, on the ability to use the C2 systems effectively and to be able to effectively communicate instructions to all of the team members.   5. Using organic digital communications with training simulationsThe simulation assisted C4I training environment is based on a low-cost system of standard PCs. The use of low-cost commercial devices can be used to support training for the commanders and staff in field locations, in a school, or at the home station.  The simulation can stimulate the C4I systems used in a Tactical Operations Center (TOC), in Tanks and Armored vehicles, and in vehicle simulators.  The SATIDS module can also be used in simulation centers using tactical equipment, or commercial computers simulating tactical devices.  The flow of information is controlled by the SATIDS as shown in figure 2.                                        Figure 2 Tactical Command and Control ArchitectureCommanders, staffs, and units can use the tactical C4I equipment in a simulation environment interacting with simulations such as Janus, ModSAF, and the OneSAF Testbed baseline (OTB).  6. Capturing the digital exercise messages for use during After Action Review (AAR)The AAR is used to show the training audience the results of the exercise, and to allow the examination of the manner in which the tasks were accomplished.In order to effectively provide this review capability, the Exercise Director must be able to capture and replay all aspects of the training exercise.  By using the data logger included with the ModSAF simulation, or other commercially available recorders, the simulation data transmitted in the form of PDUs can be captured and replayed for the AAR.  By using the SATIDS as the communications infrastructure, all of the analog and digital traffic traverses the same data network as the simulation data.  Thus, all of the C2 message traffic is available for capture and subsequent analysis and replay.  Once the data is available for analysis, the exercise staff can assist the commander to identify the areas where additional training is needed.  The commander and the staff can then plan for the next training iteration.  The training cycle begins again with a return to the simulation environment to train on tasks that were not successfully executed on the prior training exercises, work on weaknesses or perform more difficult or complex tasks under more stringent conditions.7. Using tactical C2 devices in a training exercise helps replicate the tactical situation.To ensure that the training exercises provide positive reinforcement, the training coordinator must determine what tasks are suitable for the simulation and what tasks can only be done in the field.  Steps must be taken to compensate for differences in the task loading between performing the task using simulations versus performing the task in the field.  The correct performance of a task in a simulator does not imply that the same task can be accomplished in the field. The ability to perform in the field may or may not exist.  However, if the individual or unit is not able to perform a task in the simulation environment, it is almost certain that the unit will have a very difficult time performing the task in the field.  Frequently, training concentrates on performing a task in isolation, giving the false impression that the task can be accomplished in a realistic situation.  Only by providing the full intensity of the intended environment can the trainee learn to handle multiple tasks and perform them in the time required for success.  The digital command and control systems provide a mechanism for this loading since the simulations can provide the level of message traffic that would normally flow from the surrounding units. The task loading in a virtual simulation is much closer than in constructive simulation.  Task loading can be a significant topic with FBCB2 systems that are implemented at the platoon leadership level.  A platoon leader in the field can encounter situations such as his vehicle drivers running into untrafficable terrain, therefore, the simulation workstation needs to be able to replicate these situations as much as possible.The simulation can generate the messages from higher headquarters, as well as from the subordinate units.  This is especially effective in a stand-alone training situation.  The use of simulations can allow the use of multiple levels of training as shown in figure 3.                            Figure 3Another aspect of providing realistic training is the ability to load the simulator with the specific terrain where the task is expected to be accomplished.  By using the same terrain, commanders will have the ability to compare the performance achieved in the simulation exercise with task performance during a field exercise.  8. Several Tactical level simulations are suitable for integration with C4I networksEffective training solutions require that the simulation environment must be able to support mixing existing simulations (Janus, JCATS, ModSAF, and the OTB) with team training manned simulators, full mission simulators, and full motion simulators.  Exercises are regularly conducted at Fort Rucker Alabama where flight simulators such as the Apache Longbow Helicopter Simulators and organic communications devices are used in a common exercise using OTB as the synthetic environment.  The trainer is able to select the best simulation application that represents the units and tasks required.  Multiple simulations are also possible where the OTB simulation system is used to represent Armor and mounted Infantry, while ModSAF represents the Helicopter, units and both can represent parts of the opposing forces.  To accomplish this interoperation of simulations, there must be a common Synthetic natural Environment (SNE) that all the applications can understand and use. Figure 4 shows the relationship between the tactical levels of C4I and the corresponding segments of a C4I simulation. Figure 49. ConclusionThe training simulations such as Janus, ModSAF, and the OTB can be integrated with the tactical command and control systems, and when used in concert, the system provides a training environment that allows soldiers to train using their organic C4I systems.  The simulation environment permits collaboration during an exercise that is made possible through the use of a simulated communications infrastructure such as the SATIDS.  The SATIDS infrastructure also allows units to train using their organic communication devices to communicate with each other without deploying the tactical communications infrastructure.  The SATIDS product is maintained and distributed by the US Army STRICOM.Author BiographiesPHILIP HOLDEN is a Division Manager for Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC).
