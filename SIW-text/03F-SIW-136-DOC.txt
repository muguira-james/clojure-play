Distributed Simulation Processes and Tools Forum (DSPT)  Distributed Simulation Development Process Forum (PROC) SessionsChairJake BorahVice ChairJeff BergenthalSecretaryVacantObjectives for this Workshop:Sessions focused on developing a generalized system engineering process for constructing and executing distributed simulations.Reviewed "lessons learned" solutions from creating real-world, useful M&S applications.Peer-to-peer sharing of insights into problems of integration, scalability, reuse, robustness, and the effectiveness of HLA 1516 standards.Comments and Recommendations:Automated process modeling tools and standardized interchange formats would greatly help the construction of distributed simulation systems.HLA 1516 Standards go a long way toward broadening wider acceptance of HLA in commercial marketplace.HLA Standards increased the reusability and interoperability of legacy simulations.The FEDEP was reaffirmed as a good systems engineering process for constructing distributed simulation systems.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)25Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)42Peak attendance (including joint sessions)54Total papers presented7“No-show” presentations0Other presentations and panel discussions0Recommended Reading List nominations (including previous nominations):03F-SIW-09803F-SIW-08003F-SIW-027
