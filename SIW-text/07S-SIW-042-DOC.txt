The DIS PDG is creating new Protocol Data Units (PDUs), and further defining existing PDUs.  The Directed Energy (DE) Tiger team, part of the DIS PDG, has designed two new DIS Protocol Data Units (PDUs) for high fidelity DE modeling and simulation:  DE Fire and DE Damage Status.  These PDUs include many DE specific parameters necessary for high fidelity DE weapons and associated effects modeling.  The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) provided funding to develop and experiment with these new PDUs during the Advanced Concept Event (ACE) 06.  This event provided a proper venue to test the new DE PDUs, with interactions between shooters and targets.  This experiment also tested the interoperability of higher fidelity DE PDUs with legacy simulations that model DE weapons using the existing DIS standard.  This paper presents the experiment plan and results.IntroductionIn February of 2006, the Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization (SISO) formed a DIS Product Development Group (PDG) to update the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) 1278.1a – 1995 standard Ref [3].  The updates include further defining existing Protocol Data Units (PDUs), and creating new PDUs.  The Directed Energy (DE) Tiger team, part of the DIS PDG, designed a high fidelity DE model, creating two new DIS PDUs:  DE Fire and DE Damage Status.  The DE high fidelity model design is documented in Problem Change Request (PCR) 152 (Ref [1]).  In November of 2006, an experiment was conducted to test the initial design, PDU exchange algorithms, fidelity/interoperability with legacy simulations, and recommend changes if required.  This paper describes the DE high fidelity model, experiment plan and results, and changes documented in PCR 174 (Ref [5]). High Fidelity Directed Energy ModelPCR 152 (Ref [1]) describes the DE Fire and Damage Status PDU structures, records, issuance rules, and all required modeling algorithms.  Models for DE weapons and target damage models are described in the following paragraphs.Directed Energy Weapons ModelsDE weapons range from precision High Energy Lasers (HEL) to High Powered Microwave (HPM) weapons.  Each has different weapons characteristics and the damage they cause on targets.  These weapons are modeled as either DE Precision or DE Area weapons.  All DE weapons are modeled as being attached to an entity.  The DE Fire PDU models both as virtually the same because each is modeled as a DE weapon fired from a platform.  The weapons parameters modeled are:Shot Start TimeCumulative DurationAperture/Emitter Location in Firing Entity CoordinatesAperture DiameterWavelengthPeak IrradiancePulse Repetition FrequencyPulse Width and ShapeDE weapons can be directed at a specific point or general area, so there are different target models:  Precision Aim Point and Area Aim Point.  The Aim Point records models differentiate between how energy is deposited on a specific target or area, and how the target is affected.  The Aim Point records are described next.Directed Energy Precision Weapons ModelingDE precision weapons are essentially lasers.  The typical laser weapon design includes some sort of active beam control system designed to concentrate the arriving energy on a particular spot on the target.  Modeling this type of active tracking system poses a challenge in the distributed simulation environment.  In the real world, a DE shot emerges from the aperture of a weapon – a well-known location – and arrives at the target spot.  One way to model the current state of a shot would be a simple line segment in a DE Fire PDU record.  But typical DIS network latencies (Ref[6]) combined with fast maneuvering targets or terrain database differences between simulations make it unreasonable to model the origin and destination of a laser using DIS world coordinate records.  Latencies and these additional effects would result in the shooter as well as other observers “seeing” completely different resulting shots.  A higher fidelity model is required to characterize the beam spot tracking in the DE Fire PDU that is insensitive to these degrading effects.  A DE Fire PDU record addresses this by identifying the target entity and then providing beam spot location, velocity, and acceleration information relative to the origin of that entity.  This allows dead reckoning of the target spot motion based on each simulation application’s notion of the current target entity state, thus canceling these accuracy-degrading effects.  However, note that problems may arise if the firing and target simulations use different geometric models for the target.   This is resolved by incorporating the Damage Status PDU parameters, which are described later.The DE spot profile on the target can be many shapes due to several variables, such as atmospheric effects, and the instantaneous velocity, acceleration, and distance of the shooter and the target.  For distributed modeling purposes, an elliptical beam spot size model was chosen as the best that would represent all possible shapes, and can be used for first order real time lethality damage model calculations.The irradiance profile can be modeled as a Gaussian shape whose peak is given in the Peak Irradiance field. Details of this Gaussian model can be found in Annex X.4 of PCR 152.  The beam spot model (Ref [1]) is shown in Figure 1.Figure 1:  Beam Spot ModelThe Beam Spot model parameters are defined as:	a = Beam Spot Cross Section Semi-Major Size	b = Beam Spot Cross Section Semi-Minor Size	( = Beam Spot Cross Section Orientation AngleThe irradiance at a point on the Y’Z’ plane is then given by: EMBED Equation.3  where: EMBED Equation.3  DE Area Weapons ModelingDE Area weapons modeling are accomplished by using the Area Aim Point records.  The energy deposited in an area is modeled as affecting one or many targets in a given area.  Separate weapons effects can be modeled for each target by the Beam Antenna Parameter record and the Target Energy Deposition record.  The Beam Antenna Record specifies the direction, pattern, and polarization of the DE Area weapon, and is described in detail in Reference 3.  The Target Energy Deposition record contains the target ID and the peak irradiance in watts per square meter.Directed Energy Damage Effects ModelsIn DIS version 6, the damage caused by conventional weapons is modeled in the Entity State PDU.  DE weapons damage models required additional parameters, so the Damage Status PDU was created.  The Damage Status PDU models structural damage and temperature effects, complementing the Entity State PDU appearance bits. Issuance rules are also defined for the DE Fire, Damage Status, and legacy Fire and Detonate PDUs.   The DE PDU structures are shown in Appendix A.  The DE PDU Exchange diagram is shown in Appendix B.DE PDU Engagement ModelA high-fidelity DE engagement is modeled as follows.  First, a DE simulation sends a DE Fire PDU indicating weapon on or fired and immediately followed by a Fire PDU.  Then, additional DE Fire PDUs may be sent depending on weapon and engagement type, and then terminates with a final DE Fire PDU, followed immediately by a Detonation PDU. A simulation that transmits the DE Fire PDU is also required to transmit the legacy Fire and Detonation PDUs.  Pulsed DE weapons, where the laser is turned on and off in rapid succession, is modeled as a continuation of a single engagement, and no additional Fire or Detonation PDUs are issued.  The DE Fire PDU may be sent multiple times while a shot is in progress to allow the receiving simulation to continuously assess damage, provide immediate feedback by transmitting Entity State and Entity Damage Status PDUs.  The target is also required to dead reckon the weapon impact point.Directed Energy PDU ExperimentThe Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) provided funding to develop and test the proposed DE PDUs during the Advanced Concepts Event (ACE) 06.  The DE Experiment Goals were 1) test the proposed DE PDU structures, issuance rules, and modeling algorithms, and 2) fidelity/interoperability testing of higher fidelity DE simulations and legacy simulations.  The DE Experiment was a unique opportunity that could test proposed high fidelity weapons modeling before incorporation into a distributed simulation standard.  The experiment had three phases:  Software development and unit test; integration test, and conduct specific experiments.  Each phase provided valuable feedback for standards development and design.  Additional details can be found in the Directed Energy Experiment Test Plan and Results for the Advanced Concept Event 06 (Ref[2]). Directed Energy Experiment ParametersThe DE experiment parameters were:Conduct experiments on a non interference basis with ACE 06.Rely on unclassified damage tables provided by AFRL.Only HEL weapons simulations will be testedOnly PDU structures and data exchange were tested.  Real world DE weapon performances were not modeled or tested.  The F-16 Pilot had no HEL weapon duration control.  Duration control was automatically set by F-16 HEL simulation.Directed Energy Experiment ResourcesThe Directed Energy resources used were the DMOC F-16 HEL Fighter, the Scenario Toolkit And Generation Environment (STAGE) simulations, and the Distributed Interactive Simulation Network Analysis Tool (DISNAT) data logger.  These systems were modified to send, receive, process, and record the DE PDUs.   Other resources used but not modified were the DMOC DIS Filter and the Joint Conflict and Tactical Simulation (JCATS).Software DevelopmentSoftware development requirements were derived from PCR 152 (Ref [1]) for the DMOC STAGE and F-16 HEL simulations. The software requirements were the creation of two new DIS PDU structures, modifying existing algorithms for PDU transmission, and adding the new DE PDU structures to the DMOC DISNAT logger for recording and analysis.  Each system was unit code tested to verify the correct PDU structures were created according to PCR 152 (Ref [1]).  In addition, all required enumerations were reviewed and verified.During software development, three issues were discovered.  First, the PDU Status field was added to the DE Fire PDU Header.  This field was added after DE Tiger team approval to provide consistency among all new DIS version PDUs.  For this experiment, this field was designated as 8 bits of padding.  Second, the DE Fire PDU Aim Point Record was not properly byte aligned as required by Reference 3.   An additional 32 bits were added, thus meeting the DIS standard for byte alignment.  And third, the description and enumerations for the pulse shape field were not provided in PCR 152 (Ref [1]).  Mr. Riley Rainy, DE Tiger Team lead was notified, and he suggested the enumeration of zero – other, be used for this experiment.Network DesignThe DMOC DE experiment simulations were connected on a separate virtual LAN.  The DMOC DIS Filter (Ref [4]) was placed between the DE Experimental LAN and ACE 06 LAN. The DIS Filter software was not modified, thus it did not pass any DE PDUs.    During some tests, Fire and Detonate PDUs were allowed to pass onto the ACE 06 network for fidelity/interoperability testing between the high fidelity DE PDUs and legacy fire and detonate PDUs.  The network diagram is shown in Appendix C. Scenario DesignThe DE PDU experiment scenario was created in STAGE and JCATS, centered on N 37° 26' 02.21", E 127° 58' 08.58.  The upper right corner was at N 37° 46' 09", E 127° 23' 09”.  The lower Left corner was at N 37° 06' 18", E 127° 32' 56".    The number of STAGE entities was limited by the F-16 HEL Fighter, which could only process 46 external tracks.  The STAGE entities and locations are shown in Table 1.STAGE EntitiesQtyLocationTarget TypeF-15C Fighter 5Upper Right N  37° 46' 09", E 127° 23' 09”, Lower Left N 37° 06' 18", E 127° 32' 56"MovingMiG 29 Fighter5Upper Right N  37° 46' 09", E 127° 23' 09”, Lower Left N 37° 06' 18", E 127° 32' 56"MovingOne Story Building5Center N 37° 26' 02.21", E 127° 58' 08.58FixedTwo Story Building5Centered around N  37° 26' 02.21", E 127° 58' 08.58FixedTank5Centered around N 37° 26' 02.21", E 127° 58' 08.584 Fixed, 1 MovingTruck5Centered around N 37° 26' 02.21", E 127° 58' 08.584 Fixed, 1 MovingHelicopter5Centered around N 37° 26' 02.21", E 127° 58' 08.584 Fixed, 1 MovingJCATS EntitiesQtyLocationTarget TypeBTR-60Center N 37° 26' 02.21", E 127° 58' 08.582 FixedTable 1:	Scenario DescriptionThe DIS filter was configured to filter almost all ACE 06 incoming PDUs, but transmit all DE PDU experiment Entity State, Fire, and Detonate PDUs onto the ACE 06 LAN.  Unit TestOnce software development was complete, a series of unit tests were conducted to verify proper PDU structures and exchanges.  During software unit testing, one issue was identified.  The Damage Status PDU did not have an Event ID field, as does the DE Fire.  During unit test, it was difficult to match the Damage Status PDU to the Entity State and DE Fire PDUs.  The Firing Entity ID field was changed to the Event ID Field.Integration TestThe integration test goals were to verify the DE PDUs were isolated from the ACE 06 network, and test basic DE PDU exchange algorithms.  First, the F-16 HEL Fighter fired on fixed and moving targets generated by STAGE.  The F-16 HEL sent DE Fire, Fire and Detonate PDUs when engaging STAGE targets.  STAGE generated Damage Status PDUs and Entity State PDUs with the appropriate appearance bits set.  The DISNAT data logger recorded all PDUs for data analysis, verifying correct DE PDU structures and PDU exchange sequences. During this PDU exchange, another DISNAT logger on the ACE 06 network verified the DE PDUs did not pass through the DIS Filter.Directed Energy Experiment ResultsThe experiments were categorized into 3 different tests: Test 1: HEL Fighter engaging a fixed ground targets, in this case, a stationary tank; Test 2: HEL Fighter engaging ground and air moving targets, in this case, an F-15C fighter; and Test 3: High Fidelity DE weapon engaging a low fidelity target.  The DIS experiment initial conditions are as follows:Exercise ID:		2UDP Port:		2000DIS Entity State Update rate:Air:	5 Seconds Straight and LevelGround:	55 SecondsDead Reckoning Algorithm:STAGE:		5F-16 HEL:	5For each test, the JCATS simulation was also run to observe how non DE modified simulations responded to DE specific PDUs.Test 1: Air to Ground EngagementTest 1 experiment parameters are as follows:F-16 HEL Fighter Weapon configurationSite ID:			48.16.1Aperture Diameter: 	0.3 MetersWavelength:		1.03E-06  MetersPeak Irradiance:		2000 Watts/MeterPulse Rep.

The F-16 HEL proceeded with an air to ground engagement, acquiring the target, and fired the HEL once the target was acquired.  Both DE Fire and Fire PDUs were transmitted.  The DE Fire PDU status flag was set to 3, for weapon on and state change.  The Fire PDU showed the correct event ID, target ID, world coordinate location, warhead type and quantity was set to 1.  After 1 second, another DE Fire PDU was transmitted, and STAGE transmitted a Damage Status PDU, showing minor damage, fire present, and white smoke.  After 2 seconds, another DE Fire PDU was transmitted showing the cumulative duration of 2 seconds, and the status flag set to 3 for weapon on and state change.  After 3 seconds, another DE Fire PDU was transmitted incrementing the duration correctly. STAGE then transmitted an Entity State PDU with the appearance bits set to Slight Damage and still active.  After 3 seconds, the F-16 HEL transmitted a DE Fire with the status flag set to 2 for weapon off and state change.  The F-16 HEL also transmitted a Detonate PDU with the correct event ID, weapon type, and detonation result.  STAGE then transmitted a Damage Status PDU showing medium damage, moderate smoke, and grey smoke.  Five seconds later, STAGE transmitted an Entity State PDU with the appearance bits set for moderate damage and smoke plume, but still active.The F-16 HEL – STAGE PDU exchanges are shown in Table 2.EntityPDU TypeTimeParametersF-16 HELDE Fire1.32.075480Duration: 0 SecF-16 HELFire1.32.075485Kinetic Fuze ContactF-16 HELDE Fire1.33.075603Duration: 1 SecSTAGE TankDamage Status1.33.112707Avg Temp: 300; Minor Damage, White SmokeF-16 HELDE Fire1.34.075105Duration: 2 SecSTAGE TankEntity State1.34.135941Slight DamageF-16 HELDE Fire1.34.075105Duration: 2 Sec, HEL OffF-16 HELDetonation PDU1.35.074731Entity ImpactSTAGE TankDamage Status1.35.093095Avg Temp: 300; Medium Damage, Grey SmokeSTAGE TankEntity State1.39.250747Avg Temp: 300; Medium Damage, Grey SmokeTable 2:  F-16 HEL - STAGE PDU ExchangeThe F-16 HEL – STAGE PDU exchanges were consistent with algorithms defined in PCR 152 (Ref [1]), and the unclassified DE damage tables provided.

The JCATS did not process any DE Fire PDUs, only the Fire and Detonate PDUs.  JCATS responded to the standard Fire and Detonate PDUs.  Another experiment was run using the F-16 HEL and STAGE, with the STAGE DE Fire and Damage Status PDU user modules disabled.  Results similar to the F-16 HEL – JCATS PDU exchanges were observed.  The fidelity – interoperability experiment proved that the proposed DE PDU exchange model worked for these two legacy CGFs only.  Other legacy simulations should be tested because they may read and process PDUs differently, and the simulation may crash.Detailed PDU Log files have been saved on the DISNAT logger for further analysis if necessary.ConclusionsThe DE Experiment was extremely successful because proposed DE models and algorithms were tested before incorporation into a standard.  Once the test results were analyzed, PCR 174 (Ref[6]) was created and submitted that corrected the deficiencies and omissions in PCR 152 (Ref[1]).  PCR 174 (Ref[6]) also added a capability to the Damage Status PDU that allows for damage records from multiple engagements in one PDU.  AcknowledgementsThe DMOC thanks the DE Tiger Team for providing the models and algorithms described in section 2.

The DE Fire PDU and Fire PDU  are sent once when the DE weapon is initially fired. A Hi-Hi DE Simulation shall process the DE Fire PDU and a Basic DE Simulation may process the Fire PDU.  Thereafter a DE Fire PDU is sent during the engagement based on the DE Fire PDU issuance rules. (5)3. A Hi-Fi DE Target Simulation shall reflect any damage during the engagement by issuing Entity Damage Status (DE) PDUs, as well as, issuing an Entity State PDU if applicable. (3, 4, 6, 7).  There is no requirement to send the Entity DS PDU or an Entity State PDU as a result of receiving a DE Fire PDU unless damage, or a change in damage, is determined.8 and 9. A DE Fire PDU with Weapons Status set to Off and a Detonation PDU are sent simultaneously at the end of the engagement.  A Hi-Fi Target Simulation will output an Entity DS PDU and Entity State PDU if applicable and a Basic DE Target Simulation will output an Entity State PDU if any damage was assessed based on the Detonation PDU.3.  The Target Simulation outputs an Entity State PDU to reflect the damage assessment based on receiving the Detonation PDU.AABBBBBBBBBABBBHi-Fi DE SimulationBasic DE SimulationAB7.
