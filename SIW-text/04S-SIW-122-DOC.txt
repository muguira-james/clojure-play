Traditionally, testing of these sensors has emphasized chamber and field tests. However, the vast number of possible field scenarios, along with many environmental variables, including terrain, backgrounds, and meteorological variations, render an exhaustive field testing program logistically burdensome and cost-prohibitive. Moreover, the release of live CB agents into the atmosphere is precluded through treaty and environmental/health concerns. This added obstacle necessitates the use of simulants for field CB testing. Many of these simulants, while approximately mimicking the behavior of CB agents in a limited number of areas, are dissimilar enough in others to restrict their effectiveness. Therefore, in order to enhance CB sensor testing, modern day methodology needs to grow to incorporate the use of virtual CB environments and analysis tools as a complement to on-site field testing. The Virtual Proving Ground (VPG) is designed by the US Army Developmental Test Command as a modeling and simulation (M&S) program to link the capabilities of the individual test centers. As part of the VPG, the Synthetic Environments working group created the Synthetic Environment Integrated Testbed (SEIT). The objective of SEIT is to provide a virtual environment where entire CB contamination scenarios can be represented. SEIT incorporates High Level Architecture (HLA) compliant simulations, physical test equipment, virtual and real sensors, near real-time meteorological data, and human operators to represent terrain, friendly and enemy entities, command and control (C2) messages, CB hazards, and CB sensors. The information provided by SEIT helps to answer the “what-if” types of scenarios that can best be represented in a virtual world. The WDTC is a key player in the SEIT, providing virtual chemical and biological hazards to the synthetic environment. WDTC currently uses the ITT Industries developed Nuclear, Chemical, Biological, and Radiological Environment Server (NCBR) to model the hazard environment, and Chemical Biological Dial-A-Sensor (CB DAS) software (also developed by ITT) to model standoff and point chemical sensors. SEIT uses these virtual chemical sensors to feed Command, Control, Communications, Computers, & Intelligence (C4I) systems with hazard detections. A significant obstacle to analysis of field test data is manifested in the ability to correlate test item alarm information with the referee instrumentation that reports the physical state (e.g. location, concentration) of the hazard. ITT’s CB Analyzer software aids post-test data processing by outputting a number of important hazard parameters from referee instrument input, including azimuth, elevation, distance to target, location, and concentration information. This information can be compared to test item alarm data for verification purposes. WDTC has successfully used CB Analyzer for the analysis of field data from standoff chemical agent detector and nuclear, biological and chemical reconnaissance vehicle tests. 1. Introduction and BackgroundRecent political events have heightened the need to develop chemical and biological (CB) sensors.  Before any of these CB sensors can be used, however, extensive testing must be conducted in order to determine the accuracy and performance of these systems.  Accomplishing this task requires many years, many millions of dollars, and thousands of man-hours to ensure that a detector will perform as designed.  The West Desert Test Center (WDTC) at Dugway Proving Ground (DPG) was established by the Department of Defense as the primary test facility for CB sensors.  The Materiel Test Facility (MTF) at WDTC is an environmentally controlled chamber facility that allows CB sensor testing with live agent under a variety of synthetically produced environmental conditions.  These types of tests provide valuable information regarding sensor detection and alarm performance in the presence of CB agents.  Unfortunately, the physical limitations of this type of testing (e.g., a limited number of backgrounds) cast a great deal of uncertainty upon the correlation of controlled chamber to real-world performance.  Additionally, due to treaty, regulatory and safety considerations, release of live CB agents into the environment is generally prohibited.  This restriction necessitates the use of CB simulants, which mimic live agent spectral signatures.   However, these compounds yield only rough approximations of live agent response, since only a relatively few characteristics can be approximated by a single simulant.  For example, while the spectral signal from a simulant might very closely approximate the live agent, other properties such as viscosity or chemical reactivity might be dissimilar enough to affect the way a generated simulant threat cloud propagates through the battlefield environment. As mentioned, both field and chamber testing of CB sensors requires large amounts of time and money.  Even so, not all possible scenarios can be tested in the field.  For example, field tests are usually conducted under relatively calm, warm conditions.  Detector performance seen under these ‘ideal’ conditions tends to vary when exposed to “non-ideal” conditions (e.g., cold and windy).  Additionally, testing performed in an isolated desert setting will not necessarily be applicable to mountainous or maritime environments.  The actual testing under all meteorological and geographical conditions is simply not feasible due to time and budgetary constraints.  Therefore, to help fill some of these testing gaps, WDTC has employed virtual environments with modeling and simulation (M&S) hardware and software tools to enhance CB sensor testing.  The Synthetic Environment Integrated Testbed (SEIT) program started as an initiative by the US Army Developmental Test Command (DTC) Virtual Proving Ground (VPG) Synthetic Environment Focus Group (SEFG) with the objective of developing an integrated and standard synthetic environment representation to support testing.  The SEIT program was developed to bring together mature test environments in an interacting and dynamic framework that provides a standard test environment and is adaptable throughout the United States Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) T&E commodity areas.  The purpose of this paper is to describe recent advances at WDTC using M&S virtual environments integrated during the SEIT process to aid in sensor testing.  Descriptions of the most significant M&S accomplishments to date are provided, and how these accomplishments can be extrapolated for use in evaluating detector performance as well as used in experimental design.  2. SEIT The United States Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) through the DTC is sponsoring the development and application of a Synthetic Environment capability operating in a distributed test framework to support the testing of technologically advanced and complex Army systems that support today’s warfighter.  Current and Future Forces are being challenged to operate in increasingly dynamic and challenging Battlefield environments, while facing opposition forces employing asymmetric threats.  To face this challenge, DTC is engaged in a program to tie the Command’s geographically dispersed Test Centers together to benefit from the resultant synergies realized from multiple commodity specific test capabilities functioning in an integrated and interactive framework.  The distributed test capability is supported by live, virtual and constructive test tools developed through DTC investment in instrumentation and the VPG, while leveraging program funds to create program-specific test capabilities.  Many of these synthetic environments and test capabilities are integrated into SEIT.SEIT integrates environmental components currently in use at DTC test centers supporting commodity specific testing and provides standard and optimized terrain and meteorological effects.  High resolution environmental representations include the CB Threat environment for testing CB agent sensors.  These high resolution test components are immersed and interact with a relatively low resolution constructive semi-automated forces (SAF) model.  The SAFs used in SEIT, One SAF Testbed Baseline (OTB) and Janus, provide an overarching environment that provides blue and red force structures and doctrinally correct tactical scenarios as well as low fidelity tactical platforms to associate virtual or live test systems.SEIT integrates high-resolution representation of the natural and man-made environment from physics-based M&S and live test capabilities using High Level Architecture (HLA) and legacy Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) architecture to facilitate dynamic interactions among components.  SEIT is supported by a distributed test framework founded on the High Performance Computing Modernization Program’s (HPCMP) Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN), which extends to the seven DTC Test Centers.2.1 SEIT IOCsSEIT development occurred through a series of three initial operational capability (IOC) demonstrations.  IOCs were conducted using a spiral development approach predicated on an evolving and increasing level of capability to support distributed and increasingly complex test requirements, culminating in a demonstration.  The SEIT IOC demonstrations used HLA federates, DIS, physical test equipment, sensors, and human operators to represent the operational battlefield.  Tactical scenarios included blue/red forces, command/control (C2) messaging, CB hazards, CB and infrared (IR) sensors, platform mobility effects, autonomous unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) activities, logistics aerial drops and live ground and aerial platforms coupled with near-real time meteorology data.  Additionally, the demonstrations were complemented through the use of several simulation tools including a simulation logger, a DIS-to-HLA (RPR FOM) gateway, and a 3D stealth visualization tool.2.1.1 IOC 1IOC 1 involved three separate threads integrated together to provide a synergistic test capability demonstrated in March 2003.  The three threads were created using mature technologies from DTC for displaying current capabilities in C4, IR ISR and CB ISR.OTB was used to generate three scenarios labeled Course of Action 1, Course of Action 2 and Course of Action 3.  Each took place on terrain modeled from Yuma Proving Ground (YPG) .C7b/.C71 terrain databases.  Scenario files captured vehicles and units, their time phased assigned tasks and movements and control measures required to execute a given scenario.The scenario used for SEIT IOC 1 and 2 was designed as a plausible blue and red force battlefield situation that would demonstrate the key capabilities of the tools included in the CB, command, control, communication and computer (C4), and IR intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) threads.  A 20 x 20-km YPG terrain box was chosen as the environment in which the scenario would take place for three primary reasons:  YPG is the VPG center of excellence for digital terrain databases; the southwest corner of YPG contains the requisite weather stations, topography, and man-made edifices required for the scenario; and the terrain could potentially be selected for Future Combat Systems Test and Evaluation (FCS T&E).WDTC Meteorology Division, National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and Northrop Grumman Information Technologies (NGIT) collaborated on the 1.1 kilometer resolution weather database superimposed over the YPG terrain database.  YPG had sufficient weather stations located within the 20 x 20-km box to provide high fidelity weather in support of the scenario.2.1.2 IOC 2IOC 2 built on the foundation established in IOC 1 and was demonstrated in August 2003.  The capability was distributed across the DREN among the seven DTC Test Centers and included the C4, IR ISR and CB ISR threads with the addition of the rotary wing platform sensor to the IR thread and the Robotics Intelligence thread.  The same terrain, meteorological inputs and scenario were used as in IOC 1 but in a distributed environment.  The scenario was expanded with Janus to include additional blue and red forces providing a more enhanced tactical scenario for a more robust test environment.  Test control and real-time data collection and analysis tools were added.  The architecture evolved from and HLA-DIS hybrid in IOC 1 to an HLA backbone with some DIS federates interacting in the HLA environment.  In addition, SEIT was integrated with the infrastructure supporting distributed testing in ATEC, particularly using the capabilities of the Inter Range Control Center (IRCC).2.1.3 IOC 3IOC 3 built on the foundation established in IOC 2 and was demonstrated in December 2003.  Technologically IOC 3 was similar to IOC 2.  The threads previously described, meteorology inputs, terrain and architecture were reused, although some of the underlying thread capabilities were optimized to support FCS test requirements.  In addition, the scenario was changed to reflect a mission for the Future Force scheduled to employ the FCS materiel, the Unit of Action (UoA).Through the decomposition of the UoA missions into tasks related to FCS required capabilities, a Task Ordered Event List (TOEL) was developed to drive the distributed test and provide requirements traceability to ensure that test data generated will result in valuable information to support evaluation of FCS systems.  This test framework and process generate data for the evaluation of components, subsystems and the overall SoS in an appropriate mission context.  Additionally the TOEL provides a “script” to conduct distributed testing, indicating simulation activities, operator activities, data collection points and driving some data collection elements for C4ISR testing. 3. West Desert Test CenterWDTC is the Department of Defense (DoD) focal point for T&E of CB defense equipment.  The CB defense test mission centers around testing equipment and methodology for contamination avoidance, decontamination, and collective and individual protection.  Testing is conducted with real chemical and biological weapons agents in surety and biosafety level-3 laboratories or chambers and with agent simulants on field test grids.  The DoD has focused resources at WDTC providing the infrastructure and expertise for a Joint Service (JS) developmental and operational CB defense testing capability unsurpassed throughout the world.  Additionally, WDTC is home to an internationally recognized meteorological division, which plays an integral role in the CB defense test mission. WDTC is developing and implementing computer M&S and digital testing to augment and enhance the CB defense test mission in coordination with the DTC VPG program. The DTC VPG will be the T&E cornerstone for DoD’s Simulation Based Acquisition (SBA) initiative, a revolutionary process for conducting heretofore traditional DoD acquisitions.  As part of a new way to conduct CB defense equipment testing, the WDTC is developing and acquiring models and simulations that provide digital representations of important test parameters and systems under test.  WDTC has teamed with ITT Industries to provide a digital representation of the CB threat environment using the Nuclear, Chemical, Biological, and Radiological Environment Server (NCBR) and the CB Dial-a-SensorTM (DAS) M&S tools.4. SimulationsSuccessful CB test simulations require a number of real-world components to be modeled.  For use in SEIT and field testing simulations, WDTC uses tools providing realistic virtual representations of CB sensor response (CB Dial-A-Sensor), meteorological conditions (4DWX), and CB environment (NCBR), along with tools necessary to render chemical threat scenarios in a virtual 3-dimensional world (MäK Stealth). Additionally, a post-test data analysis tool (CB Analyzer) allows a “replay” of real-world field simulant testing via a simulation, facilitating validation of sensor alarm data and scenario/experimental design. 4.1 CB Dial-A-SensorCB Dial-a-Sensor (DAS) is a tool (Figure 3.1-1) designed to simulate point and standoff, active and passive, chemical and biological sensor systems.  DAS enables users to dial in parameters to set performance characteristics for a known or proposed set of detector technologies including point ionizing chemical detectors, standoff passive chemical detectors, point particle-counting biological sensors, active imaging sensors and others using extensible markup language (XML) technology.  The user is able to attach these sensor models as NBC sensor payloads to a variety of platforms including unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned ground vehicles.  DAS provides data, in the form of ASCII files, or to other simulations, live sensors, or sensor or C2 system operators (man-in-the-loop) to stimulate sensor-to-user interface and NBC warning and reporting.  The DAS software architecture is modular and scalable so that it can be easily extended to support new technology classes of NBC sensors.Figure 4.1-1. Modular Dial-a-Sensor architecture4.2 Four Dimensional Weather (4DWX) System The Four Dimensional Weather (4DWX) System is a physics-based model used to generate meteorological data for SEIT.  4DWX predicts atmospheric phenomena with 1.1 km resolution, and simulates ground truth measurements providing historical, virtual, and real-time weather.  Numerical weather prediction models, terrain and land surface characteristics, and data from weather measurement systems are used by 4DWX to create the meteorological data sets.  4DWX serves as the meteorological data for the Ocean, Atmospheric and Space Environment Server (OASES) HLA meteorological server for use in SEIT.  OASES was developed by the Defense Modeling and Simulation Office (DMSO) as part of the EnviroFed program.  OASES ingests and publishes the natural environment for distributed simulations.  OASES converts standard meteorological files (e.g., Gridded in Binary (GRIB)) for use by distributed simulation.  OASES does not generate the meteorological data.  The user determines what data is published during the ingestion process.4.3 NCBR Environment ServerThe Nuclear, Chemical, Biological and Radiological (NCBR) Environment Server is an existing simulation developed by a consortium led by the Army’s Edgewood Chemical Biological Command (ECBC) and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) to provide hazard clouds for distributed simulation. In real time, the NCBR calculates a high fidelity, three-dimensional (3D) hazard environment as a function of hazard delivery system (source term), meteorological conditions and complex (3D) terrain. The DTRA SCIPUFF and the Naval Surface Warfare Center’s Vapor, Liquid, Solid Tracking (VLSTRACK) Gaussian puff models provide the means for the NCBR to calculate CBR hazard environments. The NCBR makes the data available to other simulations via full 3D representations of the environments (instantaneous air concentration), 2D grids (dose, deposition, air concentration, and lethal dose, or LD, contours), and at a point via a subscription process.  Figure 4.3-1 portrays a sample 2D conformal (to terrain) NCBR instantaneous air concentration calculation showing the effect of complex terrain on the cloud. ECBC has served as the proponent for configuration control and release of the NCBR, and DTRA supported the migration of the tool to the DoD’s emerging HLA standard for distributed simulation.Figure 4.3-1  NCBR representation of  SEIT IOC 3 chemical hazard4.4 3D VisualizationTo provide three-dimensional visualization of the elements of the test, this effort employed MäK Stealth commercial software from MäK Technologies, Inc.  ITT software engineers used the plug-in capability in MäK Stealth’s architecture to enable visualization of the 3D hazard as recorded from the synthetically generated Gaussian puff hazard calculated by the NCBR Environment Server.  Figure 4.4-1 portrays a snapshot of MäK Stealth portraying the terrain, the reconnaissance vehicle platforms with their standoff chemical agent detectors, and the chemical release.Figure 4.4-1 MaK  Stealth visualization of SEIT IOC 2 chemical threat4.5 CB AnalyzerCB Analyzer is a Linux-based post-test data analysis tool that was specifically developed by ITT to evaluate actual CB detector field test hazard release data.  WDTC uses the tool to compare the hazard cloud position and concentration relative to any number of standoff chemical detectors, both vehicle-mounted and stationary.  CB Analyzer is highly customizable, with scan angle limits, angular resolution, and detector thresholds all user-definable through simple extensible markup language (XML) configuration files.  In order to perform each analysis, measured values of the elapsed time, heading, length, width, height, easting, and northing of the chemical hazard release are collected from the referee IR camera data.  For concentration data, time-dependent values measured by the scanning referee instrumentation are used.  Each detector has recorded data points for elapsed time, easting, northing, heading, and speed.  Using these data, CB Analyzer simultaneously determines the position and concentration-pathlength (CL) of the hazard relative to any number of detectors on the test grid and generates a series of XML files that can be exported into a spreadsheet program for analysis and plotting.  The plots created from the CB Analyzer data are used to validate detector alarm data.  The types of data generated by CB Analyzer are shown in Table 4.5-1.                     Table 4.5-1.  Data Generated by CB AnalyzerOrdinateAbscissaDescriptionMax CLTimeMaximum detected CL valuesAzimuth @ Max CL TimeAbsolute or relative azimuth to the hazard at max. CL Elevation @ Max CL TimeElevation angle to the hazard at max. CL Azimuth RangeTimeMax/min azimuth angles that hit the hazardElevation RangeTimeMax/min elevation angles that hit the hazardDistanceTimeDistance to the nearest point on the hazard surfaceFigures 4.5-1 through 4.5-3 depict three of the types of plots that can be generated by Analyzer. Figure 4.5-1 shows the maximum detected concentration pathlength (CL) values measured by two vehicle mounted detectors as a function of time representative of a recently conducted field test.  This plot illustrates that both vehicles recorded nearly identical CL values during the indicated time interval.  By comparing these maximum CL values with the other Analyzer plots, one can determine how each detector was positioned relative to the hazard cloud and how this position affected the observed CL data.  In addition, Figure 4.5-2 shows the maximum/minimum elevation angles for one of the detectors that hit the hazard as a function of time along with representative test item alarm data.  This plot provides information on where the cloud was located at any given time relative to the detector.  The examination of the alarm data within the CB Analyzer data assists in the validation of the alarm data.  Similar plots describing the azimuth angles that hit the hazard are also produced (Figure 4.5-3), thereby giving a complete hazard cloud representation.  Finally, in addition to position, Analyzer can also provide information on the distance to and/or through the hazard relative to the detector.Figure 4.5-1.

Conclusions/Future PlansSEIT was developed with a relatively low cost and accelerated schedule to meet the pressing requirement for FCS testing.  Development and implementation costs were controlled by leveraging mature capabilities and high quality expertise throughout DTC.  SEIT has provided an avenue for demonstrating the usefulness of M&S-based test technologies developed through the DTC VPG and has greatly advanced ATEC distributed testing.  Additionally, the resulting capability has a much broader application to joint service research and development, test and evaluation, and training applications and systems. WDTC has capitalized on the suite of modeling and simulation tools integrated in SEIT to demonstrate a CB defense equipment distributed test capability that will serve the joint CB defense community both now and in the future.  The program managers for CB detectors are already taking advantage of the M&S capabilities integrated and demonstrated during SEIT IOCs 1-3.SEIT is still optimizing its environmental representations and distributed test capabilities to enhance its capability to support Army testing, in particular FCS.  The next demonstration of the capability is planned for the Distributed Test Event 4 (DTE 4) scheduled for August 2004.JAMES A.
