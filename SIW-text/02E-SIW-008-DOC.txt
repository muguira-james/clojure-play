It is often said that America and Britain are two nations separated by a common language, indicating that this first standard needs to be reinforced by others. Manifestly an effective language translator would be a great assistance in achieving interoperability. The US-UK military communities have a history of success with regard to the deployment of liaison officers to act as translators and so improve communication. Experience gained from this success can be applied to the modelling & simulation community.The National Center for Simulation in Orlando is regarded by many as the current crown of the modelling & simulation world, and the US Army Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation Command (STRICOM) as the jewel in that crown. In order to assist the community in achieving interoperability this paper gives an English translation of STRICOM. It will describe, in terms understood by Britons and most other Europeans, the mission, tasks and organisation of STRICOM. How the US military identify and meet training requirements will be explored. The Paper will also detail current and future US Army simulation programmes. Finally it will outline the arrangements for commercial contract agreements with STRICOM and point out how Europeans can get help.Whilst not identifying any technical standards necessary for simulation interoperability the rationale of this paper is to improve communication between Europeans and STRICOM. 1.   IntroductionEffective communication is an essential prerequisite for interoperability. The medium of communication is language. Every schoolmaster knows that teaching is in essence a special form of conversation and that language is at the heart of the process [1].  Every good commander knows that is as true for military operations and training as it is for teaching.  To be an effective weapon language needs to be honed as much as any sword. Consider a group of American and British soldiers standing outside a building awaiting their instructor. The instructor arrives and tells the group to ‘stand in 3 ranks on the pavement’. This command produces 2 squads of soldiers about 5 yards apart! A translation of the command then becomes necessary.On allied military operations communication is made effective by the deployment of liaison officers to act as translators.  The liaison officers express the aims, intent and purpose from one command to another. An excellent example was shown during the planning phase  of Operation Desert Storm in December 1990. At the start of this phase VII (US) Corps and 1st (BR) Armoured Division exchanged liaison teams. The liaison enabled a smooth and efficient passage of lines operation to be executed prior to maximizing the combat power of all the Corps’ divisions. “It was important to me that British officers should be integrated within the American planning staff in order that they could represent a British view and contribute to the development of an operational plan that would maximize the combat potential of the British Forces. I discussed this with General Schwarzkopf at an early stage and he readily agreed.” de la Billière [2].A key aspect in the current transformation of military forces is training. The need to utilize simulation to enable this training is clear and present. STRICOM is the US Army’s leader for simulation and as the British Liaison Officer to the Command one of my tasks is to enable US-UK interoperability. The aim of this paper is to assist in ensuring effective communication.2.   The National Center for SimulationWhen you talk simulation you have to talk about Orlando, Florida. This not just because Mickey Mouse happens to live there: Orlando is home to over 160 simulation and training companies, The Institute for Simulation & Training at the University of Central Florida, two military simulation and training commands (Naval Air and Army), and the Air Force Agency for Modeling and Simulation. NASA is only 30 minutes drive away near Cape Canaveral. No surprise then that the National Center for Simulation (NCS) was formed and headquartered in Orlando in 1994. No doubt it did help that Disney’s Magic Kingdom and Universal Orlando were already in Orlando and contained some of America’s favourite entertaining simulation rides.The NCS is a unique and innovative non-profit organization whose mission is to serve as the Nation’s focus and catalyst for the development, understanding and advancement of simulation technologies. A secondary aim is to create and enhance jobs in Central Florida; in order to do this NCS members design, develop and produce some of the world’s best interactive instructional systems using a tailored mix of computer technology, virtual reality, simulation, artificial intelligence and multimedia techniques. [3].The brainchild of business and government leaders, NCS is an open consortium of government, defence industry and academic members. The NCS sits within a much wider partnership known as ‘The Florida Simulation Center’. This is composed of 14 governmental agencies, educational institutions and defence contractors’ groupings. The 3 main commercial groupings are The Florida High Tech Corridor Council, The Economic Development Commission of Mid Florida, and The Orlando Chamber of Commerce. The grouping enables a wide variety of experience and developed applications to be exchanged for mutual benefit. Commerce may gain insight into government developed technologies, whilst the military can exploit advanced techniques developed for the consumer. Defence readiness is improved, space exploration is enabled, education is supported, and the use of simulations is extended. The result is that both the theme park ride and the military training simulation are world class.The NCS is not be confused with the ‘National Simulation Center’. The latter is based at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas and is an Army organization with the US Army’s Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC).  The organization is essentially responsible for defining the military requirement for training systems.3.   US Army Training & Simulation VisionThe US Army’s intent to be more strategically responsive and dominant across the entire spectrum of future conflict has necessitated a requirement for more effective training. The Army training system is being revitalized by updating training doctrine, refocusing institutional education and leader development, improving home station training, enabling deployed training and modernizing the Combat Training Centres (CTC). [4]. The doctrine will state that commanders must be provided with the necessary Training Aids, Devices, Simulations and Simulators (TADSS).The availability and quality of TADSS to support training will be increased. The Major Army Commands have been directed to conduct a thorough analysis of all TADSS requirements, fielding schedules and upgrades. Project Managers will have to adjust programmes as deemed appropriate by TRADOC. Embedded training is becoming the preferred method to field simulations and resources have been directed to this area.  The Simulations and Modelling for Acquisition, Requirements and Training (SMART) initiative is likewise the preferred method for developing training solutions. Evolutionary Acquisition (sometimes referred to as ‘spiral development’) is now accepted as the best way to provide capability in a timely manner.In our ancestors’ day they used old strategies and shot arrows. Today we use new strategies and fire rifles. It would be a mistake to use the old strategy with new weapons. [5].The update in training doctrine will allow for the Contemporary Operational Environment, which encompasses globalization, asymmetry and digitization; and provide a stronger link to joint operational doctrine.Institutional education and leader development is to be refocused in order to produce the ‘right education and right leader at the right time and in the right place’ no matter where and when the correct teaching moment occurs. Distance learning, reachback support, and feed forward tutoring are essential elements. Another stated principle is to ‘rekindle the passion for training.’Home station training is to be improved to allow the brigade commanders to train their own brigades in the priorities of their Mission Essential Task List (METL). Improvements will be tailored to each station but will include Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT) facilities, and Digital Multi-Purpose Range Complexes To enable deployed training, wherever practicable the key systems enabling home station facilities must be transportable to wherever the brigade is on operations. The CTCs will produce the full spectrum operational environment needed to enable the required preparedness short of actual operational missions. CTCs will provide a realistic, comprehensive and multi-dimensional collective training experience. The achievement of instrumentation commonality across all CTCs, so to allow for seamless training and provide economy of scale in acquisition, is a major aim. Tactical engagement systems (TES) will need to replicate the effects of future weapons – including non line of sight weapons. The use of the Army Battle Command System (ABCS) will be fully integrated into the common CTC instrumentation architecture. The linkage of TES, ABCS and the instrumentation will enable a thorough after action review (AAR) process.STRICOMSTRICOM has the task of turning this Vision into actual equipment. The Command is “On Point for the Army in Interoperable Training, Testing, Instrumentation, and Simulation Solutions for the Army’s Transformation”. The Command prides itself on its core competencies of Acquisition Excellence, Logistics Power Projection, and Technology Generation & Application. The Command was created in 1992, and is part of the Army Materiel Command (AMC). AMC exists to provide the Army with everything it needs: if the soldier eats it, wears it, flies it, drives it, shoots it, pulls it, listens to it, or watches it then it’s from AMC! 4.1 Mission.STRICOM’s Mission contains 4 essential tasks:Provide training and test simulation, simulators, target and instrumentation products and services. Thus STRICOM has to develop and procure all simulations and simulators required to meet training and testing needs. This includes being the Army’s Executive Agent for CTC Instrumentation. Note that ‘testing’ is in outline the function of the Ordnance Board in UK.Create a common synthetic environment to test notional concepts and to support research & development designs. This is essentially implementing the SMART Initiative for all STRICOM’s programmes, as well as offering modelling and simulation support to the rest of AMC so that all AMC products are the best that can be developed and fielded.Generate and maintain science and technology initiatives, and leverage all 3 simulation domains to develop a system of systems that ‘train as we fight’. This is akin to executing a UK applied research programme to ensure that the military aren’t wholly dependent on commercially developed products and ideas.Provide materiel life cycle support from concept development through disposal. Thus even after fielding STRICOM has to maintain the kit, upgrade it, and dispose of it when necessary.4.2 Organization.STRICOM’s organizational framework is a Headquarters, which controls 4 full colonel military project managers (PM), and 4 support directors. A PM covers each of the simulation domains: live, virtual, constructive, and test.The Headquarters contains the one star commanding general (CG)(who is also the PM for the Joint Simulation System – JSIMS), a civilian deputy who is a member of the Senior Executive Service (ie a top ranking civil servant) a full colonel military chief of staff, and their associated support staff. There is a Chief Scientist, attached from academia under the governmental inter department act, who ensures that the Command is aware of what may be technically possible in the near future. The Principal Deputy for Acquisition (PDA) is the expert on implementing acquisition policy – see more under ‘doing business with STRICOM’. The head of the Command Analysis and Planning Office (CAPO) is responsible for the coordination and integration of all cross Command activities and functions. CAPO also maintains the strategic plan and historical record. The final piece of the HQ team is PM Simulation Technology Integration (STI), who is an army lieutenant colonel.  PM STI was once described to me as the CG’s odd job man. In reality his 2 main functions are to provide overwatch on external projects of concern to more than one PM – the best example being digitization-simulation integration and interdepency – and to act as the initial filter for new business (again see more under ‘doing business with STRICOM’.)The PM Training Devices (PM TRADE) is the ‘live’ training systems/simulation man, so is responsible for their acquisition and life-cycle management. Specific tasks include: serving as the Executive Agent for CTC Instrumentation and System Acquisition; fielding of Tactical Engagement Simulators and MOUT facilities; support of training the digitized force in the live environment; and support to institutional learning and training programmes. PM Combined Arms Tactical Trainers (PM CATT), has to manage the development, acquisition, fielding, and life cycle support of the virtual synthetic environment and associated TADSS, in support of individual, institutional, and collective training. PM CATT looks after the Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT) – the mother of our own CATT system. Platform specific trainers for the army’s ground, air and command elements are run from this PM’s area, as is support to the Special Operations Command (SOCOM).PM Warfighters’ Simulation (PM WARSIM) develops and sustains constructive simulations supporting the Army's command and staff training requirements from Company/Battalion through to Corps/Army levels across the full mission spectrum.These simulations are also used to train in a Joint Service environment. PM Instrumentation Targets and Threat Simulators (PM ITTS) manages the research, development, design, acquisition, fielding, modification, and capability accounting of major instrumentation, targets, and threat simulators required for both developmental and operational test and evaluation (T&E) and training. He develops and implements policy direction and control over funding and execution of ITTS projects and is the  Army's single manager for acquiring all the materiel. note bene: for the PMs there are equivalents in the UK’s Defence Procurement Agency (DPA). Readers will know that within the DPA the integrated project team responsible for the procurement of ‘simulation’ systems is known as the Joint and Battlefield Trainers Simulations & Synthetic Environment Team (JBTSE). JBTSE has managers for the live, virtual, constructive and targetry domain, but none for instrumentation and threat simulators. The Contracts Directorate develops, plans and manages STRICOM’s acquisition process and contracting activities. The Directorate is following an approach to migrate to an Electronic Business/Electronic Commerce (EB/EC) environment in order to achieve rapid product delivery while most effectively using enterprise resources.The Engineering Directorate see themselves as pathfinders, the providers of choice for vital advances in applications of modeling, simulation and instrumentation technology. They run a technology base research programme and give technical advice on design and test to all PMs.The Operations Directorate’s mission is Program Management for Life Cycle Support and Operations. This is akin to what the Defence Logistics Organisation (DLO) does in UK. There are 4 tasks: plan and manage an integrated logistics support and materiel readiness program to support programs in development and fielded systems world-wide; provide provisioning and supply support for acquired systems and the command; maintain and manage STRICOM’s property records and facilities; and procure and manage any Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) required.The Resources Directorate are the money managers. They provide full resource management support to the command including: providing a planning, programming, budgeting and execution system (PPBES) service: providing quantitative analysis primarily related to cost and economic analysis; and conducting cost realism evaluations for the command. 5.   Key ProgrammesSTRICOM is currently handling over 160 separate programmes covering all domains and the science & technology base. The following outlines are unclassified translations of the Operational Requirements’ Documents (ORD) for the key ones.Common Training Instrumentation Architecture (CTIA). CTIA will provide the baseline training architecture for all future live training capabilities worldwide. It will be in the CTCs, homestations and deployed.  It will enable the CTCs sytems, digital range complexes, MOUT, and the One Tactical Engagement Simulation System. It will allow for integration of constructive (One Semi-Automated Forces/WARSIM) and virtual simulations (Close Combat Tactical Trainer) into live digital training events and will provide the linkage with Army operational C4ISR systems. One Tactical Engagement Simulation System (OneTESS). OneTESS provides a live environment tactical engagement simulation system that replicates weapon effects of combat systems in the conduct of collective training. It will provide the architecture for future systems to maximize embedded training capability; support precision live combined arms force-on-force exercises at homestation, CTCs and deployed sites; and is compliant with CTIA. It will incorporate the Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement Systems XXI (MILES XXI) enhancements. These enhancements include discrete player identification for all participants, enhanced audio-visual cueing effects, event recording and display, increased programmability of weapon characteristics, and increased ability to account for side, flank, corner, and rear shots.New Generation Army Targetry Systems (NGATS). Targets are needed to portray realistic opposing threats. NGATS is the future ground system that will provide high fidelity target signatures, evasive targets, shoot-back capability, and remote scoring. Using commercial-off-the-shelf technology NGATS will provide a more reliable system at lower cost. The NGATS will be mobile, transportable, deployable, and capable of continuous support. Aviation CATT (AVCATT). The AVCATT system brings the CCTT virtual environment to aviation units. It will provide a fair-fight, realistic, high intensity, task-loaded, synthetic combat environment composed of attack, reconnaissance, cargo, and utility aircraft reconfigurable simulator platforms, semi-automated forces workstations, AAR capability, a Battle-Master Control console, and workstations for ground role players. Close Combat Tactical Trainer XXI (CCTT XXI). CCTT XXI integrates Force XXI digitized command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence (C4I) systems into CCTT. Systems included are Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2) and The Army Tactical Command and Control System (ATCCS). FBCB2 is integrated into appropriate vehicles and command posts to provide situational awareness and command and control to the lowest tactical echelons. CCTT XXI facilitates a seamless flow of battle command information across the battle space. Warfighters Simulation (WARSIM). WARSIM is the next generation constructive simulation for use in providing U. S. Army command and staff training. It will use advanced modeling and simulation techniques, and will incorporate WARSIM Intel Model (WIM), which is the intelligence driver for WARSIM. WIM can replicate division through national intelligence collection sources and will support training command posts and their military intelligence (MI) staffs.One Semi-Automated Forces (OneSAF). OneSAF is a composable, next generation Computer Generated Force (CGF) that will represent a full range of operations, systems, and control process from entity to battalion level. With a variable level of fidelity it can support all the user domains (research, acquisition, and training). It also will represent the physical environment and its effect on simulated activities and behaviors. OneSAF will be the future entity level battalion and below constructive simulation that, when linked with WARSIM and the CATT family of virtual simulators, will seamlessly integrate live, virtual, and constructive simulations into realistic synthetic battlespaces. OneSAF will represent C4I, combat, combat support (CS), and combat service support (CSS). Its fielding will significantly reduce exercise overhead. Army Battle Command System Integration (ABCSI). ABCSI will enable instrumentation systems to collect digital data to prepare the after action review (AAR). This program is critical in providing a bridge between the legacy and objective instrumentation systems. It enables the CTC legacy instrumentation systems to collect digital data for the preparation of AARs for ABCS-equipped units. The Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT). The ICT is a partnership programme with the entertainment industry to advance the army’s knowledge, expertise, and capabilities in creative simulation technologies to support military acquisition, analysis, and training in the 21st century. An aim is to replicate compelling realistic experiences, in the same way that Hollywood does!6.  Doing Business with STRICOM STRICOM quite naturally strives to get ‘the biggest and best bang for each buck’. They are always looking to improve their acquisition process and to expand the use of commercial products and processes to lower costs. The Command developed an easier way to initiate business no matter how large or small. The STRICOM Omnibus Contract (STOC) system was set up to better meet the goal of acquisition excellence. The Principal Deputy for Acquisition (PDA) has fielded a STRICOM Knowledge Centre aimed at improving business efficiency and productivity. The PDA also acts as Ombudsman.6.1 Initiating Business.There are 3 simple ways to initiate business with STRICOM: Via the web. Go to  HYPERLINK http://www.stricom.army.mil/ http://www.stricom.army.mil/ and click on the large red area, which states ‘Doing Business with STRICOM’. Then select the "Initial Customer Contact Form" button displayed and fill out the form as fully as possible – or not, whatever - then press the "Submit" button. Via mail. Send an e-mail directly to this address:  HYPERLINK "doing_business@stricom.army.mil" doing_business@stricom.army.mil, or write to either the PDA or PM STI at: US Army STRICOM, 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, Florida. 32826-3276. USA.Via telephone. Telephone 001-407-384-3773, there are multiple lines and multiple people available for this number. (Fax is 0014073843528)In each of the cases you will get through to a member of the PM STI Team. The team has military and civilian members who are aware of the entire scope of STRICOMs programmes so can answer any enquiries. A STRICOM representative will contact you within 24 hours of your inquiry.6.2 STRICOM Omnibus Contract (STOC).In April 2001 STRICOM awarded an eight-year Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract to support the business domains of all 4 PMs. In order to leverage the cooperation of the military organizations co-located in Orlando, STOC is also used by The Air Force Agency for Modeling and Simulation (AFAMS); Joint Simulation System (JSIMS); Marine Corps; U.S. Coast Guard; and the Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD). This Multiple Award Contract (MAC) was designed to meet the requirement for a streamlined, quick response contractual vehicle for the long-term simulation, needs of STRICOM. The MAC established a group of thirty-three highly qualified large and small business contractors capable of competing on future requirements within each business domain. Awards were made to contractors on the basis of their qualifications and ability to furnish a complete range of products and services within a specific business domain. Delivery/task Orders are issued under this MAC for tasks throughout the total acquisition life cycle. [5]STRICOM’s preferred contract method is now STOC. This contractual vehicle permits the issuance of task orders for modelling and simulation efforts at any phase within the acquisition life cycle. Current opportunities can been seen via the STRICOM HomePage given in 6.1. The total estimated ceiling for this acquisition is an aggregated $4B for all contracts, Lots, and resulting Delivery/Task Orders. The ordering period is eight years. Changes to the list of contractors will be possible.6.3 The Knowledge Centre.The fielding of the Knowledge Centre (accessible through STRICOM Home Page) was part of an Army wide shift to improve knowledge management. The use of information technology tools coupled to better management tools and more available knowledge is aimed at improving productivity and effectiveness. The Centre will allow instant messaging to and through the workforce as well as instant access to information and information sharing between subject matter experts and programme managers. A more informed workforce is less likely to duplicate effort and more likely to leverage information across the Command.6.4 The Ombudsman & Competition Advocate.The PDA serves both these roles. As the Command Ombudsman the PDA provides an unbiased review process of requirements and competition, and is available to act as an independent agent from the contracting officer to handle concerns and issues from industry. As the Competition Advocate the PDA is responsible for identifying and removing challenging barriers such as unnecessarily detailed specifications or burdensome contract clauses. The combined positions were established in 2001 in order to improve communications among all interested parties involved in the acquisition process.7.   ConclusionsEffective communication is an essential prerequisite for interoperability and thus success on allied operations. The exchange of liaison officers to facilitate translation will enable such communication. The principle also applies to collaborative business practices.The US Army is committed to a significant transformation. In the midst of this transformation the Army must maintain its ability to fight and win. This requires more effective training. Our armies may no longer need skilled horsemen, but controlling a future combat system requires even greater skill than horse riding. [7].Modelling and simulation are the critical enablers that will allow the Army both to train and maintain its readiness and develop & field the Objective Force. Simulation is a dynamic multi-billion dollar high technology business used world wide to improve productivity and effectiveness. Central Florida contains the largest concentration of simulation business in the world.The Army has a clear vision and a stated intent to increase the availability and quality of training simulation systems. It is STRICOM’s job to make this vision a reality.STRICOM has a simple organization with clear lines of responsibility. It has the resources, knowledge, techniques and motivation required to succeed in its mission.Any commercial enterprise wanting to be part of the training modernization needs to understand and do business with STRICOM.STRICOM’s acquisition and business processes are easily accessible, open, fair, competitive and robust. The processes are regularly examined and any identified weaknesses improved.If you can’t do business with STRICOM then you probably won’t be in business long.The British Liaison Officer exists to help you.**********************8.
