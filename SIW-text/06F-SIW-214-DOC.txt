Also, I had three consecutive papers jointly with the SNE/SENS forum (in their room)….BUT it crossed two sessions (i.e. one before the first break and two after the first break)….that meant that my forum had to move back and forth between rooms multiple times during the first two sessions….this caused some confusion…and I know for a fact two people failed to attend a presentation because they were not aware the “joint” sessions had ended.  Still everything ran smoothly and the presentations were well received.
