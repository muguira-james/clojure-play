Simulation Conceptual Modeling Study GroupChairJake BorahVice ChairVacantSecretaryVacantObjectives for this Workshop:Update Study Group members on progress made since the Fall 03 SIWPresent and discuss future plans for transitioning the SCM SG to a SCM Product Development Group at the Fall 04 SIW Comments and Recommendations:All new attendees to the study group were urged to sign-up on the SCM SG email reflector.Attendees were reminded that a data call has been made for readily available empirical evidence of simulation conceptual modeling.  Several new sources for data were suggested by the attendees.  These sources will be investigated by either the person making the suggestion or the SCM SG chair.All attendees were given homework assignments to complete in the next four months.  The homework assignments were to review and comment upon the SCM Vision Statement, the SCM Annotated Bibliography, the draft SCM SG Final Report, and SCM PDG Product Nomination.  These are artifacts that the SCM SG will leave as a foundation for the SCM PDG.Enthusiasm for a SCM SG remains high particularly in view of the dependencies the Base Object Model PDG and VV&A FEDEP Overlay PDG have for a simulation conceptual modeling product. Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)29Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)29Peak attendance (including joint sessions)N/ATotal papers presentedN/A“No-show” presentationsN/AOther presentations and panel discussionsN/ARecommended Reading List nominations (including previous nominations):N/A
