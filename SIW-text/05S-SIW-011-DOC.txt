"Technical and Operational Constraints for Web Based M&S Services for the Global Information Grid"Johnny GarciaGeneral Dynamics7025 Harbour View Blvd suite 101 Suffolk, VA. 23435John.garcia@gd-ais.comKeywords:Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (C4ISR), High Level Architecture (HLA), Webservices, Command and Control Information Exchange Data Model (C2IEDM), Battle Management Language (BML), Base Object Models (BOMS), Open Standards, Model Driven Architecture (MDA).Abstract:  Modeling and Simulation services should be developed as a weapon system or C4I systems are developed for the Global Information Grid (GIG).  Related M&S standards should address key technical aspects of simulation design necessary to advance composability within the GIG environment, but avoid overly constraining implementation details. These requirements may assist the, Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (C4ISR) and Models and Simulation (C4ESIM) Systems developer on technical and operational constraints addressing a full range of services from training, analysis, alternative course of action analysis, Effects based operations, acquisition requirements and many other requirements, each of which may have different objectives that order different representational details, timing constraints, dispensation demands, etc. This paper will narrow down some technical standards and frameworks to develop semantic composable M&S services for insertion into the GIG as embedded Modeling and Simulation Services for Joint Command and Control. While many of these services will operate within HLA, JTA DODAF and JC2 standards, some may require parallel processing or other unique configurations, bringing with them their own set of requirements. These developers will require some standards to follow for development of their services for this environment.  This paper will look at the uses of a common data exchange mechanism (C2IEDM), levels of conceptual interoperability Model (LCIM), use of Battle Management Language (BML), Military Missions and Means Framework (MMF), Model Driven Architecture (MDA), Web enabled Modeling and Simulation Services (XMSF), Semantic Web, and other technologies and frameworks with light and mobile battle-space visualization to prove that semantic composability is achievable.	 IntroductionIn my 16 years of working in the Department of Defense Modeling and Simulation Community there has been a lack-luster effort in developing composable simulation frameworks outside of Military training and experimentation, which does not promote the mentality of “train as we fight”.  Where do we (DOD M&S community) go to prove that these wonderful tools we have developed can be utilized to save lives and assist the decision makers develop alternative course of Actions and non-kinetic warfare.  There has been much progress on the theoretical side of M&S composability, most notably complexity results for the component selection problem [1][2][3][4], and a formal theory of composability [1][5][6]. Dissimilarity this lack of progress in introducing composability for command and control and modeling and simulation interoperability, which in the last ten to fifteen years has netted the warfighter with an overabundance of technologies that, has advanced Military Operations Research, and the Department of Defense Modeling and Simulation communities. But these technologies and frameworks have created an even larger problem of interoperability, reprocess and composability. With the development or inception common practices of utilizing Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) [7], Aggregate Level Simulation Protocol (ALSP) [8], High Level Architecture (HLA) [9], Extensible Modeling and Simulation Framework (XMSF) [17], Battle Management Language (BML) [21], Command and Control Information Exchange Data model (C2IEDM), Military Missions and Means Framework (MMF) [31], Model Driven Architecture (MDA), Base Object Models (BOM), C4ESIM Technical Reference Model (TRM), Defense Information Initiative Common Operating Environment (DII COE) , Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES), and Global Information Grid (GIG) to name a few, has given developers tools to glue together Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Security, Reconnaissance (C4ISR) and Models and Simulation (C4ESIM) components into a federation of proprietary services.   I will no longer use Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Security, Reconnaissance (C4ISR) and Embedded Models and Simulation throughout the text I will use C4ESIM.  These developed proprietary services have proven ineffective in providing effective use of valid M&S to C2 federations. As the need for valid and doctrinal sound simulations increases for real world operations the importance of common information exchange mechanisms, common frameworks and common practices will have to formed and utilized.  I will utilize the military sense making process as the platform to perform experiments and analysis to either prove or disprove that current technology and frameworks exist to foster semantic composability.  Within the command and control process, sense making is a creative process with very limitedly support from C4ESIM Systems.  Sense making has been defined in the context of Net-centric Operations as follows:"Making sense of a situation begins with putting the available information about the situation into context and identifying the relevant patterns that exist…. The capability now exists to detect, identify, track, and destroy … traditional military formations of tanks, ships at sea, and aircraft in flight. … Being able to bring available information to bear involves more than collecting needed information. … Sense making is much more than sharing information and identifying patterns.  It goes beyond what is happening and what may happen to what can be done about it.  This involves generating options, predicting adversary actions and reactions, and understanding the effect of particular courses of action”[10]Command and control quality has been increased by an order of magnitude as we have moved from data-driven solutions (a System-centric approach exchanging text messages) towards information-driven solutions (a System-of-systems Net-centric approach utilizing a common operational picture).  To reach the next level of command and control quality, information has to be applied in the given context, leading to the rise from information to knowledge in the net centric quality chain.  To this end, procedural knowledge must be applicable.  Technically, Simulation applications can do this with procedural knowledge. Simulations must be initialized with the same operational data from the underlying command and control infrastructure.  In other words: Modeling & Simulation (M&S) functions and data manipulation will become an integral component within Net-centric operations. This paper will argue that current Command and Control and simulation technology can be effectively integrated to support a commander's sense making abilities.  This paper will describe capabilities that the author will use as part of his research to introduce that composability can be advanced by utilizing a common specification for fusing components of services mentioned in the text.  I will give a brief introduction or refresher on these taxonomies, ontology’s and frameworks and conclude how I will try to fuse each as part of my research.  Background2.1 DIS Distributed Interactive SimulationIn 1983 the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) sponsored the SIMNET (SIMulation NETworking) program to create a new technology to expand the current single task trainers into networked team trainers. SIMNET was tremendously successful, producing over 300-networked simulators with the technology that was to develop into DIS [7]. In the past, DIS and SIMNET were often confused, but the ambitions of DIS are considerably larger than those of SIMNET. SIMNET devices used the same technology, whereas DIS is aimed simulators using dissimilar technology. [11] In distributed interactive simulation, real people can take part, using real equipment, to do the things they have to do in a real war, fighting against or alongside other people and systems that are simulated by computer models. This allows armed forces personnel to be trained (or to develop tactics or to evaluate the utility of a particular system capability) while the influence and interactions of other people, units, and systems are simulated. With modern communications, the various simulators do not need to be in the same location, allowing participants to use the very same equipment in the simulation that they would use in war. This also makes the experience more realistic and directly transferable to wartime operations, which is particularly important for providing commanders the opportunity to develop and evaluate operation plans. Even during a war, alternative plans can be experimented through simulation before being implemented. These two ideas are expressed as train-as-you-fight and take-the-simulation-to-war. To make distributed simulation possible, the various models and communications must comply with a consistent set of protocol standards. [12]2.2 Aggregate Level Simulation Protocol (ALSP)Aggregate Level Simulation Protocol (ALSP), both software and a protocol, is used to enable disparate simulations to communicate with one another.  It is used extensively by the United States military to link analytic and training simulations to support training requirements for Corps and above [8]. ALSP consists of three components:   The ALSP Infrastructure Software (AIS) providing distributed runtime simulation support and management; A reusable ALSP Interface consisting of a set of generic data exchange message protocols (i.e., formal rules for information exchange) to enable interaction among objects represented in different simulations; Participating simulations adapted for use with ALSP.2.3 High Level Architecture (HLA)The HLA is a technical framework that focuses primarily on application interface challenges. The Defense Modeling and Simulation Office (DMSO) are overseeing HLA development [13,14,15,]. The High Level Architecture (HLA) provides a common architecture supporting reuse and interoperation of simulations across the U.S. Department of Defense. The HLA is based on the premise that no one simulation can satisfy all uses and users. An individual simulation or set of simulations developed for one purpose can be applied to another application under the HLA concept of the federation: a composable set of interacting simulations. The intent of the HLA is to provide a structure, which will support reuse of capabilities available in different simulations, ultimately reducing the cost and time required to create a synthetic environment for a new purpose. The Defense Modeling and Simulation Office (DMSO) is leading a Defense Department-wide effort to establish a Common Technical Framework to make simulations interoperate with each other and with C4I (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence) systems. The High Level Architecture (HLA), as a component of the Common Technical Framework, provides the structural basis for interoperability.  [16].2.4 Extensible Modeling and Simulation Framework (XMSF) The Extensible Modeling and Simulation Framework (XMSF) is defined as a modeling-&-simulation tailored set of self-consistent standards, processes and practices employing a set of web-based technologies and services to enable a new generation of Internet-distributed applications to emerge, develop and interoperate. Many software systems that composably scale to worldwide scope utilize the World Wide Web. Therefore, it is evident that an extensible web-enabled framework offers great promise to scale up the capabilities of M&S systems to meet the needs of training, analysis, acquisition, and the operational warfighter. By embracing commercial web technologies as a shared-communications platform and a ubiquitous-delivery framework, C4ESIM can fully leverage the burgeoning commercial web services industry. XMSF has several high-level requirements derived from years of experience with M&S frameworks, and the challenges of their effective deployment across diverse networks and systems. XMSF must enable simulations to interact directly and scalable over a highly distributed network, achieved through compatibility between a web framework and networking technologies. XMSF must be equally usable by human and software agents. Clearly XMSF must support composable, reusable model components. XMSF use cannot be constrained by proprietary technology or legally encumbering patents which might discourage the free, open, ad hoc development of interconnected tactical models and simulations. XMSF has two primary thrusts: development of exemplars to demonstrate the feasibility of XMSF technologies, and community outreach and engagement to encourage broad involvement and acceptance, especially with respect to development of broadly acceptable, open standards. These two thrusts provide feedback to each other. The exemplars inform the development of community standards. The community outreach encourages and engages other practitioners and users to enrich the pool of exemplars. It is only through broad experimentation and open discussion that we’ll achieve standards that serve the entire C4ESIM community. WEBSIM consortium between SISO, Web3D, OMG and OGC, and the WebSim conferenceOver the past decade a new style of architecture for information systems has emerged. This style is characterized by the lack of any central administrative authority, loosely coupled - autonomous components, and the ability to rapidly change in response to new capabilities and requirements following the principles of self-organizing systems. The World Wide Web is the most well known implementation of this style. One field that is not well represented is Modeling and Simulation (M&S). The goal of the WebSim Partnership is to encourage the development and application of open standards and conceptual guidelines that will enable the M&S community to leverage this new style of architecture and to integrate their products into systems with a broader scope. The WebSim Partnership vision is of M&S components participating as part of a horizontally integrated system of systems architecture using web technologies and aligned business practices. Under this style of architecture, M&S components should be autonomous systems capable of interfacing with other operational systems, data feeds, and data consumers in real-time. Decision makers should be able to task M&S systems as part of their set of normal operational tools. M&S systems, in turn, should be able to integrate components of the operational system with simulated components and data to perform rapid and relevant what-if analysis for decision makers. Migration of legacy components must be supported as well [19]. 2.5 Battle Management Language (BML) is defined as the unambiguous language used to command and control forces and equipment conducting military operations and, provide for situational awareness and a shared, common operational picture. It can be seen as a representation of a digitized commander’s intent to be used for real troops, for simulated troops, and for future robotic forces.  [20]  "BML is the unambiguous language used to Command and Control forces and equipment conducting military operations and to provide for situational awareness and a shared, common operational picture."In other words, BML was developed as a common standard to represent military tasks, actions and missions, both in simulations and Command and Control systems and therefore is applicable in the context of this section as well. A proof of principle BML prototype was developed in the domain of ground forces (for a US Army Mechanized Brigade).  BML will allow a commander to develop a plan and exchange data with other organizations – the commander's subordinates, his superiors and his equals. To this end, three views are necessary to cope with all BML challenges:• BML doctrine: Every term used within BML must be unambiguously defined and must be rooted in military doctrine. Doctrine is also the basis for the strategic views and business processes supported by the Platform Independent Model (PIM).• BML representation: The representation structures and relates the terms defined in the doctrine in a way that they result in the description of executable missions and tasks. A mission is hereby defined by a sequence of tasks that must be executed in an orchestrated manner. This is done using extensions and enhancements of the Command and Control Information Exchange Data Model (C2IEDM) that I will discuss later in the text.  • BML protocols: In order to communicate the necessary initialization data into BML and the resulting executable missions and tasks from the BML to the executing system, communication protocols are needed. XBML uses XML to structure the data and web services and SOAP to communicate. Figure 5 shows the scope of the BML methodology Figure 5 Scope of BML Methodology2.5.1 Extensible Battle Management Language (XBML)   The US Defense Modeling and Simulation Office’s (DMSO) Extensible M&S Framework (XMSF) initiative has started with this BML prototype (consisting of a future US Army C2 System and a US Army Entity Level Simulation) is transforming it into a joint and coalition solution (using a Joint C2 System and a Joint Simulation) based on open standards. The XMSF prototype will demonstrate a web-enabled Extensible Battle Management Language (XBML). This version is based on the NATO C2 standard, the Command and Control Information Exchange Data Model (C2IEDM) and will be extended by applying the standards promoted by XMSF. The goal of XBML is a methodology for developing standard doctrinal terms and allowing these to be accessed as web services in the context of an operational mission plan. Figure 6 [21] shows the first architecture phase of XBML as an XMSF exemplar.   Figure 6 XBML first XMSF ExemplarModel Driven Architecture Model Driven Architecture (MDA) [22] defines three viewpoints (levels of abstraction) from which some system can be seen. From a chosen viewpoint, a representation of a given system (viewpoint model) can be defined. These models are (each corresponding to the viewpoint with the same name):  Computation Independent Model (CIM), Platform Independent Model (PIM) and Platform Specific Model (PSM).  MDA is based on the four-layer metamodeling architecture, and several OMG’s complementary standards; which is shown in figure 7. These standards are Meta-Object Facility (MOF) [23], Unified Modeling Language (UML) [24] and XML Metadata Interchange (XMI) [25]. Layers are: meta-metamodel (M3) layer, metamodel (M2) layer, model (M1) layer and instance (M0) layer.Figure 7. MDA four-layer MOF based Metadata ArchitectureBase Object Models (BOM’s) A BOM is reusable package information representing or supporting a pattern of interplay.  It is also used to support composable simulation environments. Once developed, BOMs would offer a standard way to define the communication patterns, which would be required among components, as well as to provide a means for encapsulating packages of data and behavior (objects) that could be shared among diverse simulation tools - hence Encapsulated BOMs. The technical challenges facing ECAP-BOMs are not difficult, given that the groups building web browsers, web servers, and other applicable web technologies have solved basic interchange problems, like SRML. However BOMs can only go so far in that an interest group will need to be established in order to standardize the specific communication patterns needed for process-oriented BOMs (P-BOMs) to interact. Encapsulated P-BOMs could potentially be a useful standard that would enable various simulation packages to interchange models. A more difficult challenge facing BOM standards in the near term will be that of gaining broad support of an interested set of developers and vendors, which could influence and support future BOM development and use. Figure 8 Describes the BOM Conceptual Model that I will extend to support C4ESIM. Command and Control Information Exchange Data Model (C2IEDM)In 1978, NATO’s Long-Term Defense Plan (LTDP) Task Force on Command and Control (C2) recommended that an analysis be undertaken to determine if the future tactical Automatic Data Processing (ADP) requirements of the Nations, including that of interoperability, could be obtained at a significantly reduced cost when compared with the approach that had been adopted in the past.  In early 1980, the then Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe initiated a study to investigate the possibilities of implementing the Task Force’s recommendations.  The ATCCIS approach comprised more than just another data model.  It was designed to be an overall concept for the future C4I systems of the participating nations.  One of the most important topics of ATCCIS was that each nation could still build independent systems with their own “view of the world” and respective applications, business rules, implementation details, etc.  Thus, ATCCIS defined a common kernel to facilitate common understanding of shared information and, therefore, facilitated facing the general challenge to reach interoperability based on various heterogeneous IT solutions.  The technical feasibility was demonstrated several times and ATCCIS based systems were a reliable part of the annual Joint Warrior Interoperability Demonstrator (JWID) programs.  Finally, the ATCCIS data model became a NATO standard with the Allied Data Publication Nr. 32 (ADatP-32) with the new name Land Command and Control Information Exchange Data Model, which was adapted in 1999.  In April 1998 the Multilateral Interoperability Program (MIP) was established by the project managers of the Army Command and Control Information Systems (C2IS) of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America in Calgary, Canada.  MIP replaced and enhanced two previous programs: BIP (Battlefield Interoperability Program) and QIP (Quadrilateral Interoperability Program).  The aim of these programs was similar to the present MIP but each was active at a different level of command. [27] By 2002, the activities of ATCCIS/LC2IEDM and MIP were very close, expertise was shared, and specifications and technology were almost common.  The merger of ATCCIS and MIP was a natural and positive step and this was recognized by the almost immediate publication of a NATO policy that endorsed MIP.  LC2IEDM became the data model of MIP, which established the Message Exchange Mechanism (MEM) and the Data Exchange Mechanism (DEM) based on replication mechanism. Finally, in 2003 the name was changed to Command and Control Information Exchange Data Model (C2IEDM).  Figure 9 is the current DMSO view on how to utilize C2IEDM as the common language for C4ESIM, the Depiction is high level and I will generate a vigorous ontology to support embedded simulations within the context of C4ESIM.   Figure (9) C2IEDM as an Interlingua Military Missions and Means FrameworkMMF is not a theory of war. Rather, it is a framework for explicitly specifying the military mission and quantitatively evaluating the mission utility of alternative warfighting Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership, Personnel, and Facilities (DOTMLPF) services and products [28].  MMF has been successfully applied in these areas:• Future Combat Systems (FCS) operational requirements definition (Purdy, PM-FCS)• Joint Training System (JTS) life cycle (Rothmann, OSD/P&R)• Naval aviation training (Duke, NAWC-TSD)• Comanche analysis of alternatives and Army Battle Control System test and evaluation (Krondak, TRAC-FLVN)• Air Operations Center design (Andrew,). More recently, [29] and [30] report that the MMF has been employed to help define the FCS test and evaluation concept. The Missions and Means Framework (MMF) uses 11 fundamental elements to organize and specify military operations. As shown in Figure 10 [31].Figure 10. Two-sided view of the Missions and Means FrameworkC4ISR TRM Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Technical Reference Model (TRM). A Technical Reference Model (TRM) is defined in the SISO C4ISR Systems-to-Simulations Data and Interface Lexicon [32] as a conceptual framework that provides the following: A consistent set of service and interface categories and relationships used to address interoperability and open-system issues; conceptual entities that establish a common vocabulary to better describe, compare, and contrast systems and components; a basis (an aid) for the identification, comparison, and selection of existing and emerging standards and their relationships.  The figure 11 depicts the types of data that must be exchanged between C4ISR and simulation systems in order to conduct effective events. As used here, “effective” means satisfying the user requirements for an event (e.g. fair fight, level playing field, real-time, data capture and replay). “Event” means any interaction between C4ISR and simulation systems, irrespective of the purpose (e.g. training, testing, planning and analysis).  I will take this frame and extended it to support C4ESIM later in the document.   Figure 11.  C4ISR Technical Reference Model for Simulation to C4ISR InteroperabilityLevels of Conceptual interoperability ModelThis section introduces the Levels of Conceptual Interoperability Model (LCIM). This focus lies within the data to be interchanged and the interface documentation, which is available. The layers are defined as follows: On level 0, no connection is established at all. On level 1, the technical level, physical connectivity is established allowing bits and bytes to be exchange. On level two, the syntactical level, data can be exchanged in standardized formats, i.e., the same protocols and formats are supported. On level 3, the semantic level, not only data but also its contexts, i.e. information, can be exchanged. Common reference models define the unambiguous meaning of data. On level 4, the pragmatic/dynamical level, information and its use and applicability, i.e. knowledge, can be exchanged. The applicability of information is here defined in an unambiguous form. On level 5, the conceptual level, a common view of the world is established, i.e. an epistemology.1 this level not only comprises the implemented knowledge, but also the interrelations between these elements [33].  At the present time the author of LCIM is extending it to support other levels and I hope this research support these extensions. The following figure displays the five levels of conceptual interoperability.Figure 12 LCIM LevelsDII CoeThe DII COE serves as a foundation for building interoperable systems across the Department of Defense (DoD). The DII COE should be considered a “plug and play” open architecture designed around a client/server model. Functionality is easily added to or removed from the target system in small manageable units, called segments. Segments are defined in terms of functions that are meaningful to users, not in terms of internal software structure or size. Structuring the software into segments in this manner is a powerful concept that allows considerable flexibility in configuring the system to meet specific mission needs or to minimize hardware requirements for an operational site (as was will be discussed in BOMS). Segmentation is the process of packaging application software into segments. This process includes conforming to a specified directory structure, creating segmentation descriptor files, and automating the installation of the software so that it can be installed with the tools provided by the DII COE runtime environment. Segmentation is necessary but not sufficient to achieve the required level of DII COE runtime compliance mandated in the Joint Technical Architecture (JTA) [35]. Site personnel perform field updates by replacing affected segments through the use of a simple, consistent, graphically oriented user interface.  Recognizing the need to increase the interoperability of mission applications for the war-fighter while lowering their cost, the Department of Defense since 1996 has directed that all new Command, Control, Communication, Computer, and Intelligence (C4I) systems, and other systems that interface to C4I systems, be in compliance with the Joint Technical Architecture (JTA), which in turn mandates use of the Defense Information Infrastructure Common Operating Environment (DII COE). The DII COE is a multifaceted framework for interoperability that encompasses [36] [37] [38].  Guidelines for software construction, packaging, and behavior; Guidelines for the operating environment; Guidelines for the accompanying documentation; Several compatible reference implementations of the operating environment for representative platforms, in the form of kernel and infrastructure support software; Guidelines for the reuse and sharing of software and data; A repository of shareable software and data; and Tools and procedures for registering, verifying, submitting, and certifying mission applications as being DII COE compliant.  Global Information GridThe DoD Transformation Planning Guidance defines the desired outcome of transformation as "fundamentally joint, network-centric, distributed forces capable of rapid decision superiority and massed effects across the battle space." The goal of this chapter is to help Program Managers and Sponsors/Domain Owners implement the DoD policies that are intended to achieve this outcome.   Net-centricity is "the realization” of a robust, globally networked environment (interconnecting infrastructure, systems, processes, and people) within which data is shared seamlessly and in a timely manner among users, applications, and platforms. By securely interconnecting people and systems, independent of time or location, net-centricity enables substantially improved military situational awareness and significantly shortened decision making cycles. Users are empowered to better protect assets; more effectively exploit information; more efficiently use resources; and unify our forces by supporting extended, collaborative communities to focus on the mission."  The Department's approach for transforming to net-centric operations and warfare aims to achieve four key attributes: reach, richness, agility, and assurance. This approach uses the Global Information Grid as "the organizing and transforming construct for managing information technology throughout the Department." It envisions moving to trusted network-centric operations through the acquisition of systems and families-of-systems that is secure, reliable, interoperable, and able to communicate across a universal Information Technology infrastructure, to include National Security Systems. This Information Technology infrastructure includes data, information, processes, organizational interactions, skills, and analytical expertise, as well as systems, networks, and information exchange capabilities.   The Global Information Grid (GIG) is the organizing and transforming construct for managing information technology (IT) throughout the Department. GIG policy, governance procedures, and supporting architectures are the basis for developing and evolving IT capabilities, IT capital planning and funding strategies, and management of legacy (existing) IT services and systems in the DoD. In discussing the GIG and how a particular program interacts with, supports, or relies upon the GIG, it is useful to think of the GIG from three perspectives-its vision, its implementation, and its architecture.  The GIG vision is to empower users through easy access to information anytime and anyplace, under any conditions, with attendant security. Program managers and Sponsors/Domain Owners should use this vision to help guide their acquisition programs. This vision requires a comprehensive information capability that is global, robust, survivable, maintainable, interoperable, secure, reliable, and user-driven. The goal is to increase the net-centricity of war-fighter, business, intelligence, DoD enterprise management, and enterprise information environment management operations by enabling increased reach among the GIG users, increased richness in the information and expertise that can be applied to supporting operational decisions, increased agility in rapidly adapting information and information technology to meet changing operational needs, and increased assurance that the right information and resources to do the task will be there when and where it is required.  Figure 13. GIG Mission areasNCES The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) created the Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) program to provide enterprise services in support of the Global Information Grid (GIG). NCES will provide Department of Defense (DoD) organizations ubiquitous access to reliable, decision-quality information through a net-based services infrastructure and applications to bridge real-time and near-real-time communities of interest (COI).  NCES will empower the edge user to pull information from any available source, with minimal latency, to support the mission.  Its capabilities will allow GIG users to task, post, process, use, store, manage and protect information resources on demand for warriors, policy makers and support personnel.  NCES will provide robust security and coordinated management of netted information resources.  It will also enable edge users to rapidly and precisely discover information resources, to efficiently task information providers, to post any information they hold, and to dynamically form collaborative groups for problem solving.  NCES compresses decision cycles by providing near real-time connectivity and computing power for warfighters and other national security users to pull the right information, at the right time, in the right format to meet operational and tactical needs.  In business and support, it provides net-based services to reduce the need to build similar redundant capabilities and communities.  By proving a core set of common services, NCES will enable system developers to focus more on providing value added capabilities, vice building infrastructure, and allow end-users greater access to the information and functions needed to support their missions.  All these capabilities allow for rapid exploitation of diverse data sources by individual and organizational users in a manner that can be customized to meet specific mission demands. M&S COI  In June 2004, the Defense Modeling & Simulation Office stood up the M&S Community of Interest and chartered its activities with an Operating Guideline. The mission is to establish an M&S COI, ensure the integration of M&S services into the GIG, and provide a forum for the M&S community to work within the COI to influence, advise, and educate the more global community with regard to M&S. The purpose is to identify M&S web-based services for inclusion in the GIG, make M&S data and services visible to the GIG user community, and to coordinate with other COIs. Like other COIs, M&S will manage its Metadata registry, establish taxonomies and ontology’s to enable discovery and retrieval services, and conduct prototype experiments or demonstration exploring the most appropriate services to enable GIG users in the key tasks of planning, training, sense-making and decision making. To be effective the M&S COI must promote Service and Joint collaboration in the use of emerging technology to adapt services for the GIG and recommend standards and architectures that will best support M&S as and Enterprise Service. Coordination across other communities will be critical as M&S has roles that span several domains. The final shape of M&S services will depend upon the design and execution of near-term proof of principle demonstrations. DMSO chairs the M&S COI, which will include representation from the stakeholders of M&S across the DoD. Like the COI the membership is under construction and is expected to be flexible, expanding to include new participants with services to provide or users with needs to be addressed [40].Name Space Management The name space management efforts of all COIs are based on the Net-Centric Data Strategy of DoD. To enable information sharing between different communities, mediation services are provided to translate between the different name spaces. Figure 14 shows how the CES and COI services are organized relative to the GIG user. The Terms are defined as:Figure 14. GIG ServicesGIG Enterprise Services (GES): Web-enabled capabilities and services available to users (humans and systems) on the GIGCore Enterprise Services (CES): Fundamental set of computing, networking, and data sharing services provided for enterprise user support Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES): Program designated to provide Core Enterprise Services on the GIGDomain: Major area of functional responsibility, less than DoD enterprise scope, comprising persistent requirements and resources, spanning organizations and other Communities of Interest (COIs)Community of Interest (COI): A collaborative group of users who exchange information in pursuit of their shared goals, interests, missions or business processes.Taking into account the description of the GIG just given, there are significant implications for future M&S programs. M&S applications and services provided by programs will need to use the CES services rather than develop their own. M&S programs will also need to participate in COIs to ensure that their data is visible and accessible to GIG users.Taxonomies and Ontology’sSo what is the purpose of this paper and why is it important to the Department of Defense and Modeling and Simulation Community? Taxonomy is an ordered list or hierarchy of terms.  Ironically, there is no agreed-upon definition for the term taxonomy or for the elements that compose it. For the purposes of this document, I will use the term taxonomy inclusively to refer to any classified collection of components.  Although the art of taxonomy and the resulting forms of taxonomic structures are rooted in the works of Aristotle, Linnaeus, and Darwin, the meaning of the term taxonomy has been expanded to cover new purposes. We now use taxonomies for creating metadata, or common words to describe an object, for information retrieval, categories supporting browse navigation, schemas governing Web page layout and structure, and data control lists used in support of data mining (searching thousands of data records to uncover patterns and relationships contained within the activity and history store to fulfill a reporting request). Examples of these classification systems and the resulting taxonomies vary in structure, composition, and purpose, but they are all organized according to defined principles.  One type of taxonomy supports information retrieval through searching. By developing and maintaining a core set of controlled vocabularies, a company can consistently label or tag its content with descriptive metadata selected from these authorized vocabularies. In addition, vocabularies can capture knowledge worker terminology and map it to a company's preferred terms. Another type of taxonomy is aimed at discovering information through browsing. Once again the taxonomy provides a controlled vocabulary, but rather than using it in the background for manipulating queries, you can display this taxonomy to knowledge workers to help them find the information they need. The navigational taxonomy consists of labels applied to categories of content based on knowledge workers' mental models of how the information is organized. A navigational taxonomy is based on user behavior and not on content. As a result, the category labels may be organized differently from the concept-based descriptive taxonomy, and they also may contain words or phrases that would not meet the standards of a descriptive taxonomy. A fundamental difference between descriptive and navigational taxonomies is that navigational taxonomies are often specialized and unique to an instance of information presentation (a portal, a site, an intranet), and multiple content management systems do not typically reuse them as they would a descriptive taxonomy. Navigational taxonomies are therefore not governed by the same rules about which taxonomy terms can be changed.  A final taxonomy that is valuable in the C4ESIM community is the data management vocabulary. This taxonomy is a short list of authorized terms without any hierarchical structure that is used to support transactions.  Until recently, this type of taxonomy, used for data management, had been considered separate from the descriptive taxonomy, used for content management. But there are areas of overlap. The taxonomy used for reporting data and the taxonomy for accessing content should be the same. Besides providing a consistent user experience, sharing taxonomy for two different purposes avoids duplication of effort, thus saving time and money.   Ontology is a specification of a conceptualization. The word "ontology" seems to generate a lot of controversy. It has a long history in philosophy, in which it refers to the subject of existence. It is also often confused with epistemology, which is about knowledge and knowing. In the context of knowledge sharing, I use the term ontology to mean a specification of a conceptualization. That is, ontology is a description (like a formal specification of a program) of the concepts and relationships that can exist for community like C4ESIM. This definition is consistent with the usage of ontology as set-of-concept-definitions, but more general. And it is certainly a different sense of the word than its use in philosophy. What is important is what an ontology is for. In my Research and work on projects designing ontology’s for the purpose of enabling knowledge sharing and reuse. In my context, ontology is a specification used for making ontological commitments. The formal definition of ontological commitment is given below. For pragmatic reasons, we choose to write ontology as a set of definitions of formal vocabulary. Although this isn't the only way to specify a conceptualization, it has some nice properties for knowledge sharing to support the formalism of C4ESIM. Practically, an ontological commitment is an agreement to use a vocabulary in a way that is consistent (but not complete) with respect to the theory specified by ontology. I want to take others research and prototypes and fuse the taxonomies to generate an ontology and Methodologies to discover toolsets for a full-scale interoperable formalism for the Levels of Conceptual Interoperability Models (LCIM) to support sense making. Composability complexity In modeling and simulation (M&S), composability is the capability to select and assemble components in various combinations to satisfy specific user requirements meaningfully. It has sometimes been seen as the elusive holy grail of modeling and simulation; past Department of Defense (DoD) efforts to achieve it have had distinctly mixed success despite the many technological developments that have occurred over the past 5 to 10 years. In [1], the authors identified key elements for defining a path to future success. The appealing imagery of arbitrary plug-and play is fatally flawed for complex models, even with adherence to the standards of DoD’s high-level architecture.  The basic reason for this is that composing models is not as simple as composing software components that provide straightforward and readily compartmented services. That is, while the engineering of pure software composition is notoriously difficult, model composition is much more difficult, something often not appreciated even by good software engineers: Models are different.  The more-complex model components have typically been developed for particular purposes and depend on context-sensitive assumptions, some of which are implied.  Figure 14 describes the difficulty of model composability.  Figure 14 Factors affecting the composability DOD M&SIn [1] the authors presented some important keys and some technological progress, as in reuse of at least a significant number of common components, the use of metadata for search and ranking of plausible components, and rapid evaluation in new contexts. The capabilities are quite different, depending on whether the function intended is simple or, as is the case in HLA fairly loose, even if complicated as DII COE.  Composability in the recent past has taken some turns for the worst in a recent workshop of experts who understand the difficulty of model composability have argued that the efforts on going in DOD model composability would ill server the end user.  I can argue both points but the thrust of this paper if how to advance composability but in the context of C4ESIM not DOD M&S.    “DoD should focus its composability efforts on those domains and circumstances in which they actually make most sense—not for their own sake, but in a “business-case” sense” [Dr. Paul Davis, RAND]. His discussions support the need for C4ESIM in the context of Sense making as discussed earlier.  I have discussed some of the needed taxonomies and ontology’s to support C4ESIM and hope to fuse these efforts to support my experiments.  Taking the Embedded Simulation Infrastructure (ESI) to C4ESIM.The Navy is working on the on the Navy’s Embedded Simulation Infrastructure (ESI)Program and describes the ESI methodology for integrating embedded models and simulations into those C4I systems that are compliant with the Defense Information Infrastructure Common Operating Environment (DII COE). The ESI Modeling and Simulation Software Development Kit (M&S SDK), provides standard software tools to link simulations to internal DII COE and C4I functions. It also provides software methods to manage both simulated data and variable time bases in C4I systems. There have been many papers that support C4ESIM [41][42][43][44], but only ESI has developed some tools that can support the research and the experiments.  Many simulation based C4I applications require a number of very similar software functions. Common M&S software functions and standard links to DII COE services are being designed to support the general class of applications. But these services need to be developed to support Functional Domains.  The standard M&S functions or services are grouped into a relatively small number of functional areas and designed to interact. These functional domains provide the organization for developing a number of standard M&S services such as force generation, time management and common display functions. Hence, structuring several relatively simple software functions can perform very complex tasks. ESI uses an Application Server as does all DII COE applications; this is where the major change of C4ESIM has to take place.  C4I Mission Applications use the client-server configuration extensively and will probably evolve to a Service Oriented Architecture based on webservices.  There are many programs in place as we speak that evolve the DII COE from a client server environment to an SOA, but the one that affect this research is the Evolution of Joint Command and Control (JC2).   Figure15 ESI Architecture Figure 15 shows the general high level ESI architecture. This configuration contains four functional modules surrounding an application server (i.e., the simulation), all layered over the DII COE. This is the example that the Navy uses and I will take this high level view of ESI with the C4ESIM TRM and generate OV’s and TV’s of the C4ESIM Architecture.  Dr Layman’s Research has made much progress and I hope to provide an ontology that supports, extends and provide a composable solution to ESI within JC2.  The development of C4ESIM I have gone over many ontology’s, taxonomies, frameworks, programs and projects that I have either worked on or have close ties to in my short carrier within the DOD C4I systems development and M&S services development, but my challenge is to fuse these ideas into a composable set to support the formalism I now call C4ESIM.   Needed steps to develop the C4ESIM experiments:C4ESIM OV-1, 2, 3 & 5C4ESIM SV-2, 4 & 11 C4ESIM TV-1 & 2Ties to the DODAF and JTA within C4ESIM TRM will be developed from the current C4ISR TRM and adopted to support C2IEDM extensions. This supports the taxonomy to ontology efforts of C2IEDM to XBML A Web services Architecture to support Net-Centric Services and extend the ESIXMSFWEBSIMOpen Standards and Open SourceProvide data sets to support the Missions to Means Framework Generation of Base Object Models for C4ESIM that supports JC2MDA to support development of PIM and PSM for C4ESIMC4ESIM must support scenario definition, scenario execution, scenario post-processing and scenario visualization.XC2I, BML, RD3 and XBMLThese steps are not in any order and will be generated as parts and pieces of my research.Figure 16 depicts how this research will have to bridge the operational and Modeling and Simulation communities to be successful.  With the evolution of a transformational M&S community and JC2 within the next few years the time is ripe for this research to take place.  Both communities have done things in a vacuum and have netted common capabilities for both communities but this research can foster composability between both. SHAPE  \* MERGEFORMAT              Figure 16. Semantic Composability for C4ESIM within the GConclusionThe need for this research is evident in recent military campaigns and planning.  This research will prove that either C4ESIM is an advantage or disadvantage to the end user and the military decision makers when it comes to sense making as explained earlier.  Is what I am proposing doable? I believe it is and I hope to prove that C4ESIM is valuable in supporting the DOD M&S master plan the development of the Global Information Grid and the evolution of JC2. References[1] Davis, P.K, Anderson. “Improving the Composability of Department of Defense Models and Simulations.” RAND:  HYPERLINK "http://www.rand.org/" http://www.rand.org/ 2003 [2] Ernest H.
