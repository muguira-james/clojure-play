However, the process by which one creates and maintains standards with standards bodies is not always straightforward; nor is there only one option. There are several options within the IEEE for maintaining these standards. This paper discusses the options for standardization within the IEEE, and the approval process for each of those options.IntroductionThe Simulation Interoperability Standards Committee (SISC) is the IEEE Computer Society's Sponsor for simulation interoperability standards.  SISC is responsible for the Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) standards [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]1278.1-1995 - Standard for Distributed Interactive Simulation - Application Protocols,1278.1a-1998 - Supplement to Standard for Distributed Interactive Simulation - Application Protocols,1278.2-1995 - Supplement to Standard for Distributed Interactive Simulation - Communication Services and Profiles, P1278.3-1996 - Recommended Practice for Distributed Interactive Simulation--Exercise Management and Feedback,1278.4-1997 - Trial-Use Recommended Practice for Distributed Interactive Simulation--Verification, Validation, and Accreditation,P1278.5  - Standard for Distributed Interactive Simulation - Fidelity Description Requirements, and the High Level Architecture (HLA) draft standards [5, 6, 7]1516 - Standard for Modeling and Simulation High Level Architecture - Framework and Rules,1516.1 - Standard for Modeling and Simulation High Level Architecture - Object Model Template Specification, and1516.2 - Standard for Modeling and Simulation High Level Architecture - Federate Interface Specification.These two groups of standards are at very different stages in their evolution.  In this paper we describe their status and suggest some  options for their future.  All of these standards may be ordered directly from the IEEE at  HYPERLINK "http://standards.ieee.org/catalog/index.html" http://standards.ieee.org/catalog/index.html.At this writing, 1278.1, 1278.1a, 1278.2, and 1278.3 are balloted, approved standards.  1278.4 is a trial use standard and is positioned to transition to an approved standard.  P1278.5 was only submitted as a PAR, but the sponsoring forum asked that it be withdrawn.  The IEEE Review Committee (RevCom) has just withdrawn it.1516, 1516.1, and 1516.2 are currently in ballot recirculation.  Ballots are due back to IEEE by July 6.Once the 1516 standards are also approved, all these standards are eligible for revision.  In the following section we describe the IEEE process for updating standards.  In sections  REF _Ref486734445 \r \h 3 and  REF _Ref486734449 \r \h 4 we provide recommendations for proceeding with DIS and HLA, respectively.Updating IEEE Standards The following text is excerpted from the IEEE Standards Board Operations Manual [8].“If a standard is not reaffirmed, revised, or withdrawn within five years of the date of publication, the Secretary of the IEEE-SA Standards Board shall notify the Sponsor that the standard will be submitted to the IEEE-SA Standards Board for withdrawal. The Sponsor may request, within 30 days of the date of notification, an extension of time.  The Sponsor shall provide evidence that action to update has been initiated. The standard remains in effect until withdrawal action is taken by the IEEE-SA Standards Board.”Reaffirmation“Standards that continue to reflect the state of the art and contain no significant obsolete or erroneous information may be submitted by the Sponsor for reaffirmation when accompanied by a ballot indicating approval by at least 75% of the interested and affected parties. When the Sponsor ballots a standard for reaffirmation, the entire document, including amendments, is open to review by its balloters. Objections may indicate the need to revise the standard rather than to reaffirm it.”Revision “The Sponsor shall initiate revision of a standard whenever any of the material in the standard (including all amendments, corrigenda, etc.) becomes obsolete or incorrect. The Sponsor may initiate revision of a standard when new material becomes available and normal evaluation of need and feasibility indicates revision is warranted. The procedure is the same as for new standards. A revision or reaffirmation is required for the cumulative scope of the project (including all approved amendments and corrigenda). This must occur within five years of the initial approval of the base standard and each subsequent revision or reaffirmation. In a revision, balloters may register objections to any part of the standard, as the revision process opens the entire document to comment. All comments shall be addressed during the ballot resolution period. (The amendment process is used when new material and possibly corrections of a limited scope are proposed.) According to 5.5, the draft revision document submitted to the IEEE-SA Standards Board shall be a complete version of the revised document. A complete document shall include both the changed and the unchanged text, with balloted changes incorporated into the document.When a standard is revised, or reaffirmed, its approved amendments and corrigenda shall be withdrawn as separate documents. These shall be included in the scope of the document (since that scope has been revised to include these). When a standard is revised, its corrigenda and amendments shall either be integrated into the document or eliminated as determined by the Sponsor balloting process.” REF _Ref486741124 \h Figure 21 shows the relationship of SISC and its standards working groups to the IEEE, its Computer Society, and its Standards Association.  Based on these relationships the process for revising a standard is essentially the same as it is for producing an initial one:Sponsor: Submit PAR to IEEE-SA for approval WG: Draft a specification and recommend that the sponsor        forward it to ballotIEEE & Sponsor: Form a balanced balloting group Sponsor: Approval to ballotSponsor: Manage ballot resolution, typically by delegating resolution of ballot comments to a ballot resolution committee (BRC)IEEE: Ballot the draftSponsor, via the BRC: Work to resolve all comments, objections, and negative votes; recirculate all technical changes, unresolved negative votes, and rebuttalsSponsor: Approve forwarding of draft to IEEE-SAIEEE-SA Stds. Board: Review and approve draftThe bottom line on balloting is this:At least 75% of the ballot group must return their ballotsAt least 75% of the returned ballots must be affirmative votes.Anything less on either count requires invocation of the ballot resolution process.Figure  STYLEREF 1 \s 2 SEQ Figure \* ARABIC \s 1 1.  SISC Standards Drafting ProcessWithdrawal“Standards that are no longer useful or of any value should be recommended for withdrawal by the Sponsor. A recommendation for withdrawal shall be supported by a ballot with a 50% return and at least a 75% approval. When the Sponsor fails to show any action to reaffirm, revise, or withdraw an IEEE standard at the end of five years from the date of publication, the Secretary of the IEEE-SA Standards Board shall, after approval of the Administrative Committee, send a 30-day ballot to the members of the IEEE-SA Standards Board on the question of withdrawing the standard. Notice of the proposed withdrawal shall be sent to all liaison representatives. Approval by not less than 50% of the members of the IEEE-SA Standards Board is required for withdrawal. When a standard is withdrawn, its amendments are also withdrawn.”DISIn accordance with the IEEE standard update policy, 1278.1-1995 and 1278.2-1995 are due for their five-year review by the end of this calendar year.  As their Sponsor, SISC has the options of reaffirming, revising, or withdrawing them.  1278.1a is also effected by this cycle because it is a supplement to 1278.  A supplement is intended to be used in conjunction with the standard which it supplements.  So, if 1278.1 is withdrawn, it affects 1278.1a.  The latter does not come up for review for another three years.  However, the withdrawal of 1278.1 would leave 1278.1a with a “pointer to the weeds” since it assumes that the reader has access to 1278.1 which would be removed from the IEEE’s catalog.  If SISC moves to withdraw 1278.1, we have also decided implicitly to withdraw 1278.1a when it comes up for review in three years.Within the US DoD over the last four years, HLA has begun to supercede as the standard for interoperability of distributed simulations.  New simulation systems are being build HLA-compliant from the beginning and many legacy systems are being converted to native HLA compliance.  However, many legacy DIS systems are being transitioned using a “gateway” architecture, i.e. they are still natively DIS.  Furthermore, these transitions are happening more in the US than among our allies.  Many of their legacy DIS simulations are being transitioned more selectively.  These systems will have to be maintained over the coming years by engineers who do not already know the DIS standards.  Given that there are still many legacy DIS systems both in the U.S. and among our allies, at a minimum the recommended wise course is to reaffirm 1278.1 and 1278.2 now, and review the future of DIS again in three years when 1278.1a comes up for review.  Reaffirmation requires balloting the entire standard using the same balloting process in which we are currently engaged for HLA:75% must return the ballot to close it.75% of the returned ballots must vote to approve the ballot to pass it.A failed ballot requires the formation of a ballot resolution committee to resolve comments associated with negative votes, followed by reballoting.Alternatively, if there is a need to revise 1278.1 to support these legacy simulations, we must act quickly to begin revisions and to request an extension.  The request for extension must include evidence that we have initiated revisions.  If we revise 1278.1, we should also take into account any impacts on 1278.1a.  In fact, given their close relationship, it may be advisable to revise them at the same time although it would be early for 1278.1a.  Doing so would put them on the same revision schedule.1278.3-1996 will come up for review in four years.1278.4-1997 was approved as a trial use standard in 1997.  The following excerpt from the IEEE-SA Standards Board Operations Manual [10] explains trial use standards.“Trial-Use standards are effective for not more than two years from the date of publication. In the absence of comments received in the trial period, the document is subject to adoption as a full-status standard by the IEEE-SA Standards Board upon recommendation of the Sponsor. Trial-Use standards shall contain a published scheduled cutoff date for receipt of comments and for further revision and approval action. This cutoff date shall be at least six months before the end of the trial-use period for the standard.The approval period for a trial-use standard that is adopted as a full-status standard without change shall be for a total of five years from the start of the trial-use period. If the trial-use period demonstrates that a trial-use standard has to undergo changes to become a full-status standard, a PAR for revision of an existing standard shall be prepared.”The cutoff date for submission of comments against 1278.4 was January 20, 2000.  As no comments have been submitted, 1278.4 may be upgraded to a full standard via submission of a petition (fax, email, or regular mail) to the IEEE SA RevCom.1278.5 has been withdrawn administratively, which is in accordance with SISC’s wishes.HLAIn contrast to the DIS standards, the HLA standards are at the beginning of their life with the IEEE.  Hopefully by the time you read this, the HLA standards will have passed the recirculation ballot and moved from draft standards, to balloted standards.SISC’s minimum responsibility for the HLA standards is to do nothing until 2005.  However, there are already discussions about making revisions. This should not be an unexpected consequence of any widely used standard.  The process for making revisions is fundamentally the same as the process we used for developing 1516 originally.  A standards working group must be formed of interested parties.  This working group must adhere to IEEE requirements for openess.The working group would work through a series of draft standards, culminating in a set which meets SISC’s needs.These standards are then submitted to IEEE as a PAR.The PAR is balloted with the balloting process described above.Based on the experience of the 1394 (FireWire) Trade Association [9], it is possible to submit a standard for balloting to the Sponsor immediately subsequent to IEEE’s approval of the PAR.  This process requires forming a new working group immediately after the ballot is approved.  We may choose to take this approach given that we will have an approved, working standard in place which will continue to work while the working group is refining the draft revisions.  Submitting a PAR to IEEE for a standard which is essentially ready to pass a ballot will shorten the approval cycle for revisions.  We must remain cognizant that proposed changes, vs. additions, have impacts on fielded systems which have already invested funds and resources becoming compliant with the first approved standard.  As their representative standards organization, we have a responsibility to ensure that changes are in the best interest of the whole community and meet a very real need.ConclusionsAs the IEEE Sponsor for the 1278 and 1516 standards, SISC has responsibility for their maintenance.  Immediate action is required of us on some standards within the 1278 series, as well as a plan for the next few years.  While we have no immediate responsibility to take action on 1516 beyond completing the ballot, it is in our best interest to evaluate the standards' future and begin planning for a smooth transition.  Doing so now will ensure that the M&S interoperability community will continue to have standards which meet its needs.References [1]	IEEE Standard 1278.1-1995 “Standard for Distributed Interactive Simulation - Application Protocols,” 1995.[2]	IEEE Standard 1278.1a-1998 “Supplement to Standard for Distributed Interactive Simulation - Application Protocols,” 1998.[3]	IEEE Standard 1278.2-1995 “Supplement to Standard for Distributed Interactive Simulation - Communication Services and Profiles,” 1998.[4]	IEEE Standard 1278.3-1996 “Recommended Practice for Distributed Interactive Simulation--Exercise Management and Feedback,” 1996.[5]	IEEE Standard 1278.4-1997 “Trial-Use Recommended Practice for Distributed Interactive Simulation--Verification, Validation, and Accreditation,” 1997.[6]	Proposed IEEE Standard 1278.5- “Standard for Distributed Interactive Simulation - Fidelity Description Requirements,” 1996.[7]	Proposed IEEE Standard P1516 “Standard for Modeling and Simulation High Level Architecture - Framework and Rules,” draft 5, 2000.[8]	Proposed IEEE Standard P1516.1 “Standard for Modeling and Simulation High Level Architecture - Object Model Template Specification,” draft 5, 2000.[9]	Proposed IEEE Standard P1516.2 “Standard for Modeling and Simulation High Level Architecture - Federate Interface Specification,” draft 5, 2000.[10]	IEEE-SA Standards Board Operations Manual, IEEE, February 2000, available at http://standards.ieee.org/guides/opman/index.html.[11]	http://www.1394ta.org.Author BiographiesPHILOMENA ZIMMERMAN is currently the HLA Program Manager for the HLA program within DMSO.
