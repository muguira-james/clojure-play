Conceptual Modeling- How do we move forward?—The Next StepJack “Jake” BorahAEgis Technologies Group12565 Research Parkway, Suite 390Orlando, FL 32826407-380-5001 HYPERLINK "mailto:jborah@aegistg.com" jborah@aegistg.comKeywords:Conceptual modeling, simulation development processABSTRACT:  At the Spring 02 Simulation Interoperability Workshop, the author presented a paper entitled “Conceptual Modeling- The missing link of simulation development” [02S-SIW-074.  That paper advocated that engineers engaged in simulation development needed to step back and develop a clear understanding of the role of conceptual modeling in the simulation development process.  As the author stated in the paper, and reaffirmed at that SIW, conceptual modeling is a lively topic of discussion.  His paper was well received by the workshop attendees and stimulated a lot of discussion during the remainder of the workshop on the topic of conceptual modeling with respect to simulation development.This paper will follow-up on that earlier work.  The author had also previously stated that, “once the role of conceptual modeling was established then the requisite elements of a sound conceptual model can be defined as a part of ongoing discussion of sound simulation development practices.”  At the 02 Spring SIW, this was the question that lingered after the paper presentation, how does the Modeling and Simulation (M&S) community move the discussion of conceptual modeling forward?  In this paper, the author will discuss the rationale for forming a SISO study group on conceptual modeling as well as recommend a strawman  conceptual modeling development process.  The objective of forming a SISO conceptual modeling study group will be the assessment of the merit of establishing a SISO Recommended Practices Guide(RPG)  for Conceptual Modeling.  A Conceptual Modeling RPG would be useful to the M&S community as a companion document to the Federation Development and Execution Process (FEDEP) RPG.  The Conceptual Modeling RPG would document the state-of-the-art, amplify the best practices of conceptual modeling as used by SISO members, facilitate peer-to-peer technical discussions, and serve as a guide for novice simulation developers. IntroductionThis paper is the second by this author in the extended discussion surrounding the use of the term “conceptual model” within the context of simulation and High Level Architecture federation development.  In the previous paper [1], the author stated that the role of a “conceptual model” and even the very definition of the term have been the basis for much discussion within the M&S community.    In yet another attempt to resolve the dilemma posed by a “conceptual model”, he advocated in that paper that the M&S community should develop a widely accepted definition and methodology for conceptual modeling by starting with a  of review some basic principles of simulation development.  This approach was well received by the workshop track attendees.  There was a lot of discussion on conceptual modeling directly following the paper’s presentation and on the side in the halls during the remainder of the workshop.Thus in this paper the author will attempt to maintain the momentum generated during the Spring Interoperability Workshop for a broad-based definition for conceptual modeling and the establishment of a sound methodology for performing conceptual modeling within the greater context of simulation design and development. Conceptual Model DefinitionThe definition established in the earlier paper for a “conceptual model” was “an abstract representation of something generalized from particular instances.”  This definition while accurate is usually not precise enough for practical use by simulation engineers and software developers.  Therefore more contextual references are needed to aid in the comprehension of conceptual modeling.  A conceptual model will be defined by the way it is used within a particular simulation development. Previous authors such as Pace [2], Lacy [3] and Haddix [4] in recent SIW papers have stated various uses for conceptual models.  Pace has stated that, “ a simulation conceptual model is a simulation developer’s way of translating modeling requirements  (i.e. what is to be represented by the simulation) into a detailed design framework (i.e., how it is to be done), from which the software, hardware, networks (in the case of distributed simulation), and systems/equipment that will make up the simulation can be built.”  Lacy noted in summarizing the outcome of a Defense Modeling and Simulation Office meeting, “The overloading of the term ‘conceptual modeling’ was discussed.  Participants eventually described two types of conceptual models—the domain-oriented Functional Descriptions of the Mission Space (FDMS) and the design-oriented Conceptual Models of Systems (CMoS).”  Finally as Haddix points out, “Many terms, including ‘Conceptual Modeling’ (CM) have multiple usages throughout the system development literature. … Does conceptual model refer to the conceptual model of the user or the conceptual model of the system designer?”In the author’s previous paper he stated that there were three generalized uses for a conceptual model.  First, it is to be part of Jeff Rothenburg’s cost-effective model constructed for a cognitive purpose [5].  Second, it is to be an embodiment of the communications in Bernard Zeigler’s modeling process [6].  Third, it is to be the result of the “art of modeling” or the process of analysis, abstraction, simplification, and synthesis within a simulation development process.  In summary, there is no single conceptual model per se because of the essence of the “art of modeling”.  There are multiple iterations of the conceptual model, which evolve as required by a simulation development process.  A simulation conceptual model is a “living” document that grows from an informal description to a formal description to communicate between the diverse groups (sponsors/users, modelers, systems engineers, and software designers) participating in a simulation development.  Conceptual Model Study GroupLast year while performing the research for the first paper on conceptual modeling, other than the previously referenced SIW papers, the author discovered a distinct lack of authoritative reference material on conceptual modeling as a part of simulation development.  Conceptual modeling has not been a term discussed in-depth within modeling and simulation textbooks.  In the last six months, the author has been tasked support the conceptual modeling of two of the Missile Defense Agency’s Core Modeling and Simulation assets.  The key word internet word searches conducted by the author in support of these task has led to a diverse set of web sites, books, and articles, most of which contributed little, if anything, to the body of knowledge of simulation development conceptual modeling.  The author found that conceptual modeling was most often a term related to database structures in the World Wide Web.  A clear and concise guide to conceptual modeling for simulation development does not exist.  This circumstance should not come as a surprise to the participants of the Simulation Interoperability and Standards Organization (SISO).  After all, it is the cause for all the earlier SIW papers.Further, the author has discovered, first through his work as a member of the drafting group for the Federation Development and Execution Process (FEDEP) Product Development Group (PDG), and later as a result of his previous paper presentation, that among the many facets of distributed simulation development under discussion within SISO, conceptual modeling is a high interest topic for SISO members.  Following the presentation of the previous paper, one of the audience members expressed the idea that perhaps it was time for SISO to form a study group on conceptual modeling.  His suggestion was well received by the other track attendees.  This suggestion was highlighted at the Spring SIW outbrief..The idea of a conceptual modeling SISO study group is a sound and practical suggestion given the role that SISO has within the M&S community.  Quoting from the Vision document, “SISO is dedicated to the promotion of modeling and simulation interoperability and reuse for the benefit of diverse M&S communities, including developers, procurers, and users, world-wide.”[7]SISO has been the body for collegial discussion of the standardization of simulation development practices beginning with the Distributed Interactive Simulation protocol, and continuing on to the recent FEDEP PDG.  No where else is the view so collectively focused upon simulation development issues than at the SISO SIW workshops.  It is the simulation engineers that most often encounter trouble with the lack of a well supported conceptual model definition and sound methodology for conceptual modeling.  At the SISO SIWs, they can become stakeholders in the solution to this problem.  One outcome envisioned for a SISO concept model study group would be the development of a recommended practices guide (RPG).  If the membership of the study group determines that such a product would be useful to the larger M&S community, then SISO would have another opportunity act as a standards body and to meaningfully contribute to the state of the art for modeling and simulation.  SISO is the proper place for this activity since SISO Vision statement states that “SISO is concerned with all factors that affect interoperability, from semantics and terminology, through agreement on the characteristics of the environment and interactions that are being modelled.”          The Basing the Conceptual Model RPG on the FEDEP ModelA widely supported RPG available in the M&S community is the FEDEP model.  Currently it is undergoing a standardization process and it is in its fourth draft in preparation for balloting as a standard.  The author proposes that the development of a SISO RPG for conceptual modeling be done as a companion document to the FEDEP RPG.  This suggestion is made partly because the FEDEP RPG embodies the state of the art in developmental practices for a functioning distributed simulation environment.  The FEDEP was written to guide novice and experienced project managers, software developers, and simulation engineers though each phase of a distributed simulation development in a logical manner.  Beginning with problem formulation then though the steps of conceptual analysis, federation design, federation development, federation integration and testing, federation execution, and ending with data analysis and output, the FEDEP presents what has been successfully used in the past to construct distributed simulation environments in several different M&S domains to assist others in their work.Another reason for this suggestion is that the utility for conceptual models spans the breadth of distributed simulation environment development.   Conceptual modeling begins in the first step of the FEDEP, Define Federation Objectives.  Guidance currently contained in the Federation Development and Execution Process (FEDEP) Model, Version 1.5, Activity 1.1, Identify Needs [8] states that “The primary purpose of this activity is to develop a clear understanding of the problem to be addressed by the federation.”  As well as, “an explicit and unambiguous statement of federation needs is critical to achieving clear communication of intent among the developers of the federation.  Failure to establish a common understanding of the required product can result in costly rework in later stages of the federation development process.”  Historically, it has been the costly failures to achieve the common understanding of purpose that have accentuated the importance of the primary purpose for a conceptual model.  As was stated earlier, a conceptual model is to be a cost-effective model constructed for a cognitive purpose.  A conceptual model can a lower cost substitute for the real system and describes key elements of the problem for detailed examination and evaluation.  One of the motivations for constructing a conceptual model is its affordability as compared to the real system.  The common understanding of the problem to be simulated is a necessary basis for any distributed simulation environment development and can be depicted in a conceptual model.  Using a conceptual model in this way is direct support of the author’s second stated purpose for a conceptual model, the embodiment of a communication process between the sponsor and the developers.   The communication process starts here and is documented for future reference in a conceptual model.  Conceptual modeling is directly addressed in FEDEP Step 2: Develop Federation Conceptual Model.  Among the products created in this step is a federation conceptual model or a “conceptual representation of the intended problem space based on their interpretation of user needs, federation objectives, and the defined environment.”   The FEDEP model states that “The federation conceptual model is a description of the entities and actions that need to be included in the federation in order to achieve all federation objectives.  These entities and actions are described without any reference to the specific simulations that will be used in the federation.”  Further, the FEDEP document adds that, “the federation conceptual model provides an implementation-independent representation that serves as a vehicle for transforming objectives into functional and behavioral capabilities; the model also provides a crucial traceability link between the federation objectives and the design implementation.”  This highlights the author’s third purpose for a conceptual model, which is to be the evolving product of the art of modeling, or the process of extraction, abstraction, simplification, and synthesis.  Here the FEDEP also states that, “this model can be used as the structural basis for many federation design and development activities (including scenario development) and can highlight correctable problems early in the federation development process when properly validated.”   Once again the cost-effectiveness of employing a conceptual model is highlighted.  This quote also indicates the utility of a conceptual model for the upcoming third and fourth steps of the FEDEP, Design Federation and Develop Federation.Activity 3.1 of FEDEP Step 3 is Select Federates.  The explanatory text for this activity states that, “The purpose of this activity is to determine the suitability of individual simulation systems to become members of the federation. This is normally driven by the perceived ability of potential federation members to represent objects, activities, and interactions in the federation conceptual model.”  The objects, activities, and interactions of the federation conceptual model are the end of result of the art of modeling.  This is further evidence of the close coupling between a conceptual model and the FEDEP model which would support the development of a Conceptual Modeling RPG linked to the FEDEP RPG.  The demonstration of this coupling continues in Activity 3.2 Allocate Functionality which states, “Once all federates have been identified, the next major activity is to allocate the responsibility to represent the entities and actions in the federation conceptual model to the federates.”From this point forward, a federation conceptual model becomes a useful tool supporting the remaining FEDEP steps.  The text for Step 4 Develop Federation indirectly references the use of a conceptual model in Activity 4.1 Develop FOM.  “Using the federates identified to meet federation requirements and the allocation of responsibilities for representation of entities and actions in the federation conceptual model across these federates, the FOM is developed to support the data exchanges required among the federates to meet the federation objectives.”  Activity 4.2 Establish Federation Agreements also indirectly references a conceptual model.  “Although the FOM defines and documents the full set of data that is exchanged among federates to achieve federation objectives, there are other types of agreements that must be reached among the federates (prior to implementation) that are not necessarily documented in the FOM.  Such agreements are necessary to establishing a fully consistent, interoperable distributed simulation environment.  For instance, federation members must use the federation conceptual model to gain an understanding and agreement on the behavior of all federation objects and how federation objects will interact with each other during the execution.”  Activity 4.3 Implement Federate Modifications continues to indicate the use of a conceptual model.  Written in the explanatory text is, “the purpose of this activity is to implement whatever modifications are necessary to the federates to ensure that they can represent assigned objects and associated behaviors as described in the federation conceptual model (step 2), produce and exchange federation data with other federates as defined by the FOM, and abide by the established federation agreements.  The usage of a conceptual model is not mentioned in any of the activities of Step 5  Integrate and Test Federation. In Step 5, the federation conceptual more is available for use, but as the focus at this point is to assemble and test the federation the conceptual model does not have a featured role.  The final reference to a conceptual model occurs in Activity 6.3 Prepare Results.  The FEDEP model suggests the federation conceptual model should be among those federation products that are archived for possible future use.  As the federation conceptual model when properly used should have documented much of the underlying assumptions and limitations of the art of modeling that occurred early in the distributed simulation environment process, it is a valuable reference artifact of this federation.  Those wishing to exam the results of the federation will need the federation conceptual model to establish the context for the federation design, development and execution.  Indeed, the federation development participants may find it useful to use the federation conceptual model to review the circumstances which drove particular engineering decisions.In conclusion, the author saw at the Spring SIW that the idea of a Conceptual Modeling RPG meets the technical acceptance principles written in the draft SISO Balloted Products Development Process document [9].  As a product a Conceptual Modeling RPG is relevant to the Modeling and Simulation community.  The audience response to the author’s previous paper at the Spring 02 SIW indicated that conceptual modeling definition and methodology was a high interest topic.  SISO members are in the position through the formulation of a Conceptual Modeling Study Group able to provide meaningful information and/or results to the M&S community.  Further, the Conceptual Modeling RPG will be timely particularly f it is linked to the FEDEP RPG as proposed as the FEDEP RPG is nearing balloting.  Once the FEDEP completes the balloting process, then the attention and energy of the interested SISO members can be focused upon a Conceptual Model RPG.  Finally, though the SISO process a Conceptual Model RPG will receive review by the technical community which needs it.  A critical mass has been achieved within SISO on conceptual modeling, now is the time to form a study group and take the next step toward standardizing the recommended practices for conceptual modeling.  References[1] J.
