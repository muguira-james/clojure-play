Simulation Conceptual Modeling Study Group (SCM SG)  ChairJake BorahVice ChairVacantSecretaryVacantObjectives for this Workshop:The presentation of two papers relevant to the development of a simulation conceptual modeling process model to spur interactive discussion.The identification of the components constituting a simulation conceptual modeling best practice.The construction of a draft simulation conceptual modeling process framework using those identified components above.The continuation of the Spring 04 SIW Final Report preparations. Comments and Recommendations:Definitive guidance on simulation conceptual modeling practices for the M&S community is long overdue.Simulation conceptual modeling is an important element of other ongoing SISO PDGs (BOM and VV&A FEDEP Overlay).The development of simulation conceptual modeling guidance requires the creation of a “vision statement” for SCM, the establishment of a set crisp definitions for SCM terminology, and the organization of a set of development concepts for SCM.A SCM PDG should be created at the earliest opportunity to maintain the momentum associated with the SCM SG. Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)40Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)40Peak attendance (including joint sessions)40Total papers presented2“No-show” presentations0Other presentations and panel discussions0
