AGENDA 	      WEDNESDAY EVENINGECONOMICS OF MODELING AND		             CYPRESS ROOM	SIMULATION 1900-2100A second meeting on the topic of ‘The Economics of Modeling and Simulation’ will be held to pursue the formation of a Study Group identified as desirable during the Fall ’99 SIW.  This meeting will reprise discussion offered at the last Workshop, including a transcript of attendees’ declared interest in the economics of modeling an simulation and suggestions for constructive pursuit of the topic within the SISO constituency and beyond.  This meeting will provide a venue for individuals and organizations concerned with economic issues to exchange ideas in general, and to pursue the establishment and execution of a Study Group for the elucidation of M&S economics considerations of particular import to SISO.  Meeting agenda will include a very brief introduction to recent activity in the area of M&S economics, discussion of a draft Terms-of-Reference charter for the Study Group, and determination of a prospective course of action for actively pursuing this topic consistent with the mission and operational infrastructure of the SISO.Modeling and simulation (M&S) has always had an economic aspect.  Simulation was perceived as being "worth doing" and we did it.   In this respect, simulation has been like many other supporting technologies such as mathematics -- you did it when you needed to, but you may well not have accounted for it explicitly.  The state of our collective appreciation of the economics of modeling and simulation is certainly varied and is somewhat a matter of debate.  We are concerned here with the intersection of the domains of economics and modeling and simulation, and particularly with the economics of M&S (rather than with the M&S of economics).There are a variety of reasons to care about the economics of modeling and simulation.  First and foremost, economic considerations affect what we do in conducting the business of M&S.  Economic factors influence our estimation of the prospective value of investment in simulation development or in the use of simulation assets.  Similarly, economics is a determinant of many critical decisions.  Shall we pay the price (cost) to invest in M&S or not?  Sellers, for instance, invest in bringing products and services to market (in order to make a profit).  Buyers invest in product and service assets (to get best value).  Users invest in procuring and employing simulation assets for improved operational efficiency (e.g., the do-your-mission "faster, better, cheaper, or only way" point-of-view).  The bottom line is that what we know (and do) about the economics of simulation matters - it influences how well we do the business of M&S.Since economics is important to us all and since many of the issues of the economics of modeling and simulation are interesting independently of M&S technology or application domain, diverse participation is expected.  The opportunity for simulation professionals in many application domains to collaborate has never been better; there is no topic that is more generally interesting or more likely to be illuminating and productive than the economics of modeling and simulation.Anyone interested in participating in and affecting the exploration of the economics of modeling and simulation is welcome to this organizational meeting.Bill Waite or Charlotte Sallas				AEgis Research Corporation	6703 Odyssey DriveSuite 200	Huntsville, AL 35806256.922.0802 Office HYPERLINK "mailto:BWaite@AEgisTG.com" BWaite@AEgisTG.com; CSallas@AEgisTG.comhttp://www.AEgisTG.comPAGE  77PAGE  89
