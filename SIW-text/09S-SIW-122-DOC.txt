Inputs from SISO membership were requested.San Diego location excellent for SISO operations. Noise issue in Brickstone moderated over the day, but was significant early.Increasing emphasis on agent based modeling additions to warfare simulations seen.Suggest SMAS be renamed “System Lifecycle Forum”.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)20Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)23Peak attendance (joint sessions)35Total papers presented7“No-show” presentations0Other panel presentations1Recommended Reading List nomination:  056                 2008 FALL SIW OUTBRIEF FORM
