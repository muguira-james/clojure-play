TES has allowed troops to train for practical missions in highly realistic combat environments without the associated risks involved with live weaponry and munitions.  This has been possible because current TES has relied largely upon the Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) and similar systems for a number of years for direct-fire weapons, using a laser to pair the shooter to the potential target(s).  Emerging systems, on the other hand, will use a pairing method called geometric pairing (geo-pairing), which uses a set of data about both the shooter and target, such as locations, weapon orientations, velocities, and weapon projectile velocities, nearby terrain to resolve an engagement.  A previous paper [1] introduces various potential sources of error for a geo-pairing solution.  This paper goes into greater depth regarding the impact of errors that originate within orientation sensing errors, beginning with a short introduction into the TES system (TESS).  The next section will explain the characteristics of the orientation sensing hardware and software that may be used by a TESS followed by a mathematical analysis illustration of the impacts of that representation.  A summary and conclusion containing recommendations will close this paper.                            IntroductionLegacy tactical engagement simulation systems (TESS) have typically used lasers to pair a shooter and target during a simulated engagement.  While proven to augment training through the decades of its use, the laser has numerous weaknesses for this application.  As such, attempts have been made – and are ongoing – to provide the Army with an improved system that does not rely solely upon lasers to resolve tactical engagements.  This paper, as part of an ongoing series of analysis papers, addresses the issues involved with geometric pairing with regards to terrain representation.The following section begins with a detailed description of the OneTESS program.  OneTESS has implemented geo-pairing for demonstrations that took place in July of 2005, December of 2005 at the Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation & Education Conference, and February of 2006 on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, and thus, provides a perfect context for the subject matter presented herein.The next section provides an explanation of the types of instrumentation that is used to measure weapon orientation and the error associated with those instruments.  That is followed by a mathematical analysis of how those errors can negatively affect the outcome of a geo-pairing algorithm.  The conclusion provides a summary of the paper, and interpretation of the analysis, and suggestions for overcoming the potential sources of error stemming from orientation sensing equipment when implementing geo-pairing.This paper is the third in a series of papers detailing and analyzing potential sources of error associated with a geo-pairing solution [2].OneTESSOneTESS is the Army’s program for the next-generation of TESS.  For greater context, consider that live training for military purposes dates back millennia [3].  Hand-to-hand combat drills under highly constrained conditions and target practice likely have histories as long as that of warfare, itself.  With the introduction of the Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) in the 1970s, live, tactical training took a quantum leap forward.  For the first time, soldiers could conduct force-on-force training under safe and, at the same time, relatively unconstrained conditions, closely reflecting the conditions experienced during actual warfare.  The application of what was then state-of-the-art laser technology enabled this advance, but this technology now faces two significant disadvantages: Lasers cannot represent indirect fire, or Non-Line-of-Sight/Beyond-Line-of-Sight (NLOS/BLOS) engagements without additional support, such as what is provided by Simulated Area Weapon Effects – Radio Frequency (SAWE-RF)Opaque and translucent obscurants that do not stop bullets, such as foliage and fog, can block laser beamsFigure 1 opposite shows a military training exercise taking place with the use of MILES equipment.  Note the equipment that makes up MILES.  The weapons in the photograph have attachments on the ends that look like metal boxes, approximately 1” X 2” X 3” in size.  These attachments fire the infrared encoded laser beams that constitute an electronic bullet.  These infrared pulses must intersect with one of numerous sensors integrated within the soldiers’ clothing.  In the picture, these sensors can be easily differentiated from the rest of the equipment as black circles, approximately one inch in diameter.  These sensors are most noticeable in a halo pattern on the Kevlar helmets and on straps going down the soldiers’ ribcages.Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 1.  Soldiers training using MILES equipmentOneTESS is intended to address this shortcoming with current equipment as well as others that have been identified over the many years of MILES service.  As such, OneTESS will support Force-on-Force (FOF) and Force-on-Target (FOT) training exercises at the Brigade level and below in all Battlefield Operating Systems at Homestation, maneuver Combat Training Centers, and deployed sites using technologies other than just lasers to pair shooters to the potential targets.  As part of these goals, OneTESS will simulate a multitude of different engagements, proper doctrines, and weapon capabilities as well as stimulate detectors, sensors, monitors and countermeasures [4].  As mentioned previously, in legacy TESS, the most common method of pairing the shooter to potential targets is with the use of infrared laser beams.  However, this paper has already identified weaknesses of this approach.  Thus, OneTESS will use a pairing method called geometric pairing (geo-pairing).  Geo-pairing uses a collection of data about the shooter, the target, and the terrain.  That data includes:Location of the shooterLocation of the targetTime of the trigger pullCharacteristics of the weapon and its ammunitionOrientation vector of the weaponAtmospheric conditionsTerrain dataWeapon orientation vectors, or rather the accuracy of such, greatly impact the accuracy with which a geo-pairing algorithm can pair a shooter to its targets.  The following section describes the orientation sensing equipment that likely would be used with TESS in general and OneTESS, specifically.Orientation Sensing EquipmentThe geo-pairing algorithm must obtain orientation measurements for the firing weapon.  This allows the algorithm, with the assistance of different physics-based munitions flyout models, Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) systems, and high-resolution digital terrain representations to estimate where the projectile will impact with the terrain.  However, the accuracy of the hardware used to determine weapon orientation can greatly impact the outcome of an engagement.According to the OneTESS Operational Requirements Document (ORD), the threshold requirement for this type of device in the context of geo-pairing indicates [5]:The system determines the miss distance or the relationship of where the projectile passed through a vertical plane relative to the optimum aim point at the target for each type of ammunition simulated.Furthermore, it has been estimated that these devices, to serve OneTESS most effectively, must have the ability to measure an absolute weapon orientation relative to true North with an accuracy no worse than 0.1 degrees, 3 sigma.As such, the OneTESS Demonstration of Technology and System (DOTS) team has investigated numerous potential weapon orientation sensors.  The TIAX Weapon Orientation Measurement sensor (WOM), a precision attitude sensor, can mount on weapons such as the M16 assault rifle. This sensor self-calibrates without the use of moving parts and eliminates the need for independent calibration by additional hardware correction devices.The internal software combines with documented field procedures to eliminate the deviational errors that arise as a result of close proximity to fixed iron masses. Using data from the field calibration procedure, the internal software provides its estimate of the quality of the calibration in terms of residual root mean square (RMS) heading error.  When a sensor must endure recalibration, the internal software then reports updated calibration data, which allows the sensor to consider updated calibration coefficients.  This capability provides the opportunity to compare old and new calibration data in an attempt to determine how the system and external environment might have changed over time or through change in geographic location.Figure 2 below shows a photograph of the TIAX WOM.Figure 2.  TIAX WOM [X]In addition to the WOM, the OneTESS DOTS team performed an industry survey to document the current state of Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs).  Table 1 illustrates the findings of that product survey.  At the time of this study, no COTS devices were located that possessed the capability to provide the navigation-grade performance while still fitting within the specified size, weight, and power constraints listed within the OneTESS ORD [5].  However, the numbers may be interesting to study in an attempt to determine the effects of poorer performance upon the accuracy of a geo-pairing solution.Incidentally, the U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM) and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) both are currently funding efforts to build a next generation IMU that can be used on OneTESS if built to the OneTESS time budget.Compass MfgPart Number/NameAccuracy Heading (deg)Accuracy Tilt (deg)PNITCM2-501.0 deg level/ 1.5 deg tilted0.4 degMicrostrain3DM-GX11.00.93CrossbowCMX5431.01.0VerhaertItrack1.01.0HoneywellHMR30000.50.5Advanced Orientation Systems Inc.EZ-Compass-30.50.5LeicaDMC-SX0.50.50CybernetTerraNav<10.0<0.1Microbotics IncMIDG II0.40.4NovasolGeosight<0.1<0.1TIAXWPV Sensor<0.1<0.1Atair AerospaceGPS-INU<2.0N/ATable 1.  Accuracy results of IMU technology surveyThe heading and tilt values in Table 1 have great importance for the outcome of an engagement resolved through geo-pairing.  The heading affects the modeled trajectory of a projectile to the left and the right, while the tilt affects the range.  Variances of even less than one degree can significantly impact the outcome of a geo-pairing engagement.  Even weapons with wide area effects can suffer from adverse consequences due to inaccuracies in the heading and tilt values measured by the orientation hardware.One last technology investigated by the OneTESS DOTS team is the Penn State Sub-harmonic Lateral Mode MEMS Gyro (SLMG).  This product has an allure because of its high level of stability, as demonstrated by its bias stability of 0.01 degrees per hour.  Product survey research determined that this capability is two orders of magnitude better than what is achievable with other MEMS gyros that are currently still under development. The SLMG also has the following advantages over other technologies investigated and considered feasible for OneTESS:Volume less than 10 cubic inchesPower requirement less than 0.5 wattsCost less than $5KRuggedLow powerHighly reliableCan fit within a sensor volume of less than 1 cubic inchThe SLMG concept is covered under Penn State University Invention Disclosure 795 entitled “A MEMS Gyro with Sub-Harmonic Electro Optical, Lateral Mode Dither Drive”.While this section provides a brief insight into the technology that exists and that could be used by OneTESS, it does little to explain – either explicitly or implicitly – what impact the errors intrinsic within those technologies would have upon the geo-pairing algorithm to be used by OneTESS.  The next section provides a mathematical analysis of how the error associated a hypothetical weapon orientation sensor – regardless of the technology employed – may affect the outcome of simulated engagements [6].  Mathematical AnalysisThe previous sections provided an understanding as to the variety of orientation sensors available and accurate they each perform their job.  This section takes that understanding and reveals the performance of a generic orientation sensor used for geo-pairing.  Applications of the orientation sensor to direct and indirect fire weapons are considered.It should be noted that for the duration of this paper two terms refer to specific concepts:Sensor-based weapon – a modeled weapon that relies upon an orientation sensor to resolve simulated engagements using a geo-pairing solutionPhysical weapon – an actual weapon used in the course of battleTo begin, this section briefly describes the methods for modeling the orientation error and determining the accuracy of the model for both direct and indirect fire. Because these are thoroughly described in [7], this paper only summarizes instead of delving deeply into the methodology.  Rather, the aim is to provide a sufficient understanding of the method used for the sake of illustrating the impact that this nature of error has in the accuracy of a geo-pairing solution.  That is followed by a description of the effort to model a generic orientation sensor using the method described and its performance, measured as the percentage accuracy of correct outcome with respect to the physical weapon’s accuracy of correct outcome engaging a 0.5 meter wide by 1.5 meter tall, planar target.Modeling Sensor AccuracyThe approach used for the work described in this paper is to model the sensors’ error distributions and weapon dispersion, and to use those models in a computational tool to determine the performance of a sensor with respect to a specific weapon.  The following subsection first describes how the distributions work, then provides an overview of the determination of a correct shot, and, lastly, explains how to put the two components together to determine the performance of the sensor responsible for modeling the physical weapon.Error DistributionsOrientation sensor measurements tend to follow a normal distribution.  This holds true for weapon dispersions, as they also follow a normal distribution. Thus, the error distributions used here are normal distributions centered on the nominal.  Therefore, a point at 0 in the normal distribution represents no error and would have the highest probability.  For this work, these distributions were discretized – or separated –into a finite and specific number of bins.    Each bin in the distribution corresponds to one measurement, and, since the distributions are finite, maximum errors are defined near the tails of the normal distribution. These maximum errors correspond with 3 sigma values in the distribution and encompass 99.7% of the possible error values.Figure 3 illustrates a normal distribution with discrete sections.Figure 3.  Normal distribution with discrete sectionsShot ResolutionIn this study, the term direct fire is to describe weapons with a nearly linear trajectory, such as small-arms.  With that in mind, a shot resolves as a hit if the shot vector – the vector that describes the flight path of a projectile – when projected out to the range of the target, intersects with the target.  Since the model in this study does not use a flyout algorithm, the accuracy in the roll measurement of the orientation sensor goes unused.  Therefore, the model is only concerned with four parameters:Azimuth of the shotElevation of the shotHeight of the targetWidth of the targetIt is assumed that the shot is perfectly aimed at the center of mass of the target and, thus, error values from the error distribution for both azimuth and elevation are selected to determine the shot vector.  These steps are performed for both shots, modeling the physical weapon – weapon dispersion – and shots modeling a sensor-based weapon – sensor measurement error. This process is performed over all possible error combinations in azimuth and elevation, from weapon dispersion or sensor measurement error, to determine the performance of the weapon as described in the following section.System PerformanceThis section aims to characterize the performance of a direct fire weapon with a predefined maximum variation in its shot vector.Both the physical weapon and the sensor-based weapon vary in their shot vector from shot to shot.  So, a 100% accurate orientation sensor is not needed, or necessarily even desired.  Instead, it must match the probability of hit or miss of physical weapon it is modeling.  Thus, the ability of a sensor-based weapon to reflect the same outcome is determined. That is, whether the model resolves as a hit or miss, as compared to the physical weapon it is modeling to measure its performance. When using this methodology, choosing a representative target size is critical.  For the study, a 0.5 meter wide by 1.5 meter tall target is used to correspond roughly with the potential size of a dismounted infantry.  Matching the same physical outcome – that is, matching the exact trajectory of the physical shot – is not examined because it requires incredibly accurate sensors as mentioned in [7].The purpose of this experimentation is to determine the probability of correct outcome for a sensor-based weapon and compare it to the probability of correct outcome for the physical weapon modeled.  To accomplish this, the probability of correct outcome for the physical weapon is computed first followed by the probability of correct outcome for the sensor-based weapon.  The probability of correct outcome is computed by evaluating every possible error combination for all error sources, applying it to the appropriate engagement model, and determining whether the correct outcome occurs.  If it does, the probability of each applied error is extracted from its error distribution and combined all together to determine the probability of this combination of errors occurring.  All combinations that result in the correct outcome are then added together.  The resulting value is the probability of correct outcome for the sensor-based or physical weapon with the given error distributions.  This calculated number for the sensor-based weapon is compared to the probability of correct outcome for the physical weapon.  If the sensor-based weapon has the same or larger probability of correct outcome as the physical weapon then it can accurately model the physical weapon.  If it does not, then a proportion of sensor-based weapon probability of correct outcome to physical weapon probability of correct outcome indicates the accuracy of the sensor-based weapon with respect to the physical weapon.ResultsThis paper strictly addresses the error introduced to a geo-pairing solution by the orientation sensor component.  To demonstrate the inaccuracy that is introduced by current orientation sensors, the average orientation sensor accuracy represented by current technology is modeled.  Ignoring the most accurate and least accurate orientation sensors to get a firmer understanding of the average case, this study was conducted using data from current orientation sensors, resulting in a composite orientation sensor with an azimuth accuracy of 0.85 degrees and an elevation accuracy of 0.48 degrees.The results shown in this paper are presented in tabular form.  The results are produced by discretizing the error distributions into 80 bins.  The table is labeled with the maximum (3 sigma) errors for the orientation sensor and the rows represent the different ranges of the engagement and the percent accuracy of the sensor-based weapon.  The percentages represent how well the physical weapon is modeled by the sensor-based weapon with the given orientation sensor errors.Direct Fire ResultsTo analyze the performance of the orientation sensor, as explained in Section 4.1.3, the accuracy of the physical weapon must be defined as a basis for comparison.  The physical weapon chosen to be modeled for direct fire is an average rifle with groupings of about 3 inches at 100 yards, or 7.5 cm at 91 meters.  The probability of correct outcome is abbreviated as Pco.  Both Pco values for sensor and weapon are represented as percentages, along with the sensor accuracy.Range(meters)Pco(sensor)(%)Pco(weapon)Sensor Accuracy5086.2610086.2610054.2410054.2420023.5810023.5840011.1099.8611.168002.7888.863.13Table 2. Accuracy of today’s sensors in modeling the average rifle (0.5 m x 1.5 m target)There is an obvious trend that as the range of engagement increases, the ability of the sensor to accurately model the weapon’s probability of correct outcome decreases nearly proportionally.  This is caused by the method used to determine whether an engagement resolves as a hit or a miss.  The method uses the dimensions of the target to provide more leeway than attempting to exactly match the weapon’s bullet trajectory to a dimensionless point in space.  As the range of engagement increases, the size of the target relative to the range decreases, thus making the target more difficult to hit.  While the average sensor today can not correctly hit a target at 50 meters 100% of the time, the average rifle is capable of hitting a target 100% of the time out to 400 meters.  Thus it is clear that the accuracy of current orientation sensors does not sufficiently model the average current small arm.Indirect Fire ResultsWhen considering indirect fire engagements, the problem becomes significantly more difficult.  Determining the accuracy for a direct fire engagement appears straightforward, but a question regarding indirect fire must be posed because of the area weapons effects associated with indirect fire munitions.  Can the accuracy of an indirect fire engagement truly be determined?  To address this question, this study looks simply at the case where an indirect fire weapon is aimed toward just one target.  If that target is within the burst radius – or kill radius – of the weapon munition, then the sensor-based weapon accurately performed to the parameters of the physical weapon, assuming the physical weapon would have produced a hit.This study recognizes the limitations of this method that result from not accounting for an engagement intended to affect multiple targets or the false positives that would occur if a sensor-based weapon’s shot hit targets that the physical weapon’s shot would not hit.  A more comprehensive model is thoroughly described in [7].For this study of indirect fire engagements, a crew-served weapon with an accuracy of 25 meters at range of 2000 meters, with a burst radius of 10 meters, and a muzzle velocity of 250 meters per second is examined.  Ranges beginning at 500 meters out to 2000 meters are considered.  To simplify, it is assumed that the munition explodes upon impact with the ground and thus, only simple ballistics flyout models for the munition are used.  Therefore, only the initial velocity and gravity affect the trajectory of the munition, meaning that no drag or other variables are considered.The same average orientation sensor that was used in the direct fire study is used in the direct fire study: an azimuth accuracy of 0.85 degrees and an elevation accuracy of 0.48 degrees.  Recall that Pco represents the probability of correct outcome.Range(meters)Pco(sensor)(%)Pco(weapon)Sensor Accuracy50032.3322.50100100030.9022.10100150028.1920.65100200025.1018.76100Table 3. Accuracy of today’s sensors in modeling a crew-served indirect fire weapon (0.5 m x 1.5 m target)The results reveal that for an acceptably accurate generic crew-served weapon, current orientation sensors are capable of manifesting a sensor-based weapon that matches or exceeds the accuracy of the physical weapon.  However, one should note that this study focuses strictly on hitting a single point target and does not account for situations in which other targets may or may not have been hit in the process of the engagement.  This type of scenario is further studied and reported in [7].Summary and ConclusionAs the other papers in this series have demonstrated in varying levels of detail and areas of concern, in a geo-pairing solution for engagement resolution, numerous sources of error can propogate.  In this case, the accuracy of the weapon orientation sensor component has been examined closely.Like all measurement instruments, there are limitations to how accurately a weapon orientation sensor, regardless of the technology employed, can measure orientation.  These limitations are often governed by physical restraints, methodology, and the quality of subcomponents.  The aim of the study described in this paper was not to identify the best possible instruments for OneTESS, but to define the parameters of an average weapon orientation sensor and to study the effects of its limitations upon a geo-pairing algorithm.To that end, the mathematical analysis, performed using modeling and simulation techniques, demonstrates conclusively that the accuracy affects the results of geo-pairing.  This is shown by comparing the results of a fictionalized weapon orientation sensor based upon a collection of actual sensors studied by the OneTESS DOTS team to the results of an actual weapon that meets its design specifications.This study also revealed two other factors in addition to the capabilities of the weapon orientation sensor that impact the results of geo-pairing:Range of engagement – the experimental results show that the further the range of the engagement, the less likely that the enagement will resolve correctlyType of engagement – the experimental results also show that the capabilities of the weapon orientation sensor impacted the results of a direct fire engagement far more significantly than those of an indirect fire engagement.  In fact, the capabilities of this average weapon orientation sensor surpassed the accuracy requirements needed for indirect fire engagements.While the brute-force approach to a solution would yield the most accurate weapon orientation sensor available, such a solution could potentially be prohibitively expensive in both monetary cost and weight cost.  Instead, some tradeoffs must be accepted as a sensor that fits into the cost and weight budgets for OneTESS may suffer in accuracy.Based upon the results, another path that should be investigated is the implementation of a type of hybrid approach that uses two or more different types of weapon orientation sensors.  Depending on the weapon system, the types of engagements, and the range of those engagements, different sensors could be used.  For long-range, indirect fire engagements, an average sensor may be appropriate.  At the other end of the spectrum, short range, direct fire small arms may require sensors with more accurate capabilities.Either way, more study is necessary to draw any additional conclusions.References[1]	Ford, Louis, and Bradley C.
