The core of the methodology is the decomposition of the ‘intended purpose’ into acceptability criteria (AC). The V&V effort focuses on determining whether these criteria are met. The AC are made quantifiable by Measures of Effectiveness (MoE), and through a further decomposition into Measures of Performance (MoP) and Dimensional Properties. It often turns out to be a highly subjective effort to quantify the items of evidence underlying these various measures.Around the turn of the century SISO sponsored two study groups on a common fidelity definition and implementation. The work of these study groups resulted in two significant reports stressing the importance of fidelity definition and measurements within any VV&A process. Based upon this work, amongst others, TNO Defense, Safety and Security developed a methodology to systematically define, specify and measure simulation fidelity.This paper presents a practical approach how the TNO fidelity methodology can be used within the REVVA Generic Process to provide items of evidence that support the simulation validity and acceptability criteria. The approach is illustrated with some results and lessons learned from a practical case-study.IntroductionIn today’s society, simulations are more and more used in crucial decision-making processes during engineering design, test and evaluation, acquisition of new systems, and in training and instruction. This increasing reliance on simulation results, the greater complexity and more frequent reuse of simulations have caused a great interest in comprehensive methods for verification, validation and accreditation (VV&A)  REF _Ref135733285 \n \h  \* MERGEFORMAT [7]  REF _Ref135732650 \n \h  \* MERGEFORMAT [18]. The availability of such comprehensive methods is essential in assessing the credibility of the outcomes of future simulations. Since the early development of simulation technology, the notion of fidelity, i.e. how well a simulation relates to reality, has been an apparent, critical and recognized part of modeling and simulation (M&S) validation  REF _Ref135732650 \r \h [18]. Despite this observation, the ability to systematically quantify and utilize fidelity characterizations within the VV&A process is even today a largely uncultivated area. Both these concerns have been expressed by a wide variety of M&S user communities  REF _Ref135732614 \r \h [6]  REF _Ref135733285 \r \h [7]  REF _Ref422533265 \r \h [8]. In 2003 this has been one of the reasons for the Western European Armament Group to initiate a research project to develop a common methodological framework for the VV&A of models and simulations  REF _Ref136418717 \r \h [9]. This project named REVVA was funded by five European nations. On behalf of the Netherlands TNO Defense, Safety and Security participated in this project. The developed REVVA methodology is currently further improved and formalized in the follow-on project called REVVA2.In the late nineties TNO also participated in the two SISO study groups on fidelity definition and implementation  REF _Ref422533265 \r \h [8]  REF _Ref136420891 \r \h [15]. Based upon the results from both these study groups, amongst others, TNO and the Delft University of Technology cooperated in de development of a common methodology to systematically define, specify and measure simulation fidelity  REF _Ref135732650 \r \h [18]. All this was done from a general simulation system life-cycle perspective, not limited by any specific problem domain aspect, approach or process. This paper presents a possible way to integrate the major concepts, metrics and recommended practices of the TNO fidelity methodology within the REVVA Generic Process. The objective of this paper is to illustrate how both methodologies complement each other and can enhance their practical applicability.The paper starts with a summery of the major elements of the REVVA methodology (Section  REF _Ref136425372 \r \h 2). Next in Section  REF _Ref136425725 \r \h 3 a brief overview of the basic elements of the TNO fidelity methodology is given. Section  REF _Ref137731160 \r \h 4 introduces the reader to the TNO fidelity methodology concepts, metrics and techniques, which can be used within the REVVA generic process model to enhance the definition and assessment of the acceptability and validity criteria along with the supporting items of evidence (Section  REF _Ref141613264 \r \h 5). To make this fidelity assessment within the REVVA generic process more explicit the paper proceeds with a practical simulation VV&A case-study executed for the Royal Dutch Army (Section  REF _Ref136428500 \r \h 6). The paper ends in Section  REF _Ref136426151 \r \h 7 with a summary of the major results and directions for future research.The REVVA MethodologyThe REVVA methodology has been the result of a joint WEAG defense research program between France, Italy, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands. The objective of this program was to develop a common integrated set of VV&A methods, techniques and standards, which are used to determine and assess the confidence in the intended user purpose of a M&S product. In this section the three major building blocks, also known as the pillars, of the REVVA methodology will be discussed. For more background information about the underlying assumptions and key concepts of these pillars the reader is referred to  REF _Ref137098089 \r \h [10].Pillar One: The OrganizationThis pillar identifies all participating parties and their roles in the REVVA generic process (Paragraph  REF _Ref137098431 \r \h  \* MERGEFORMAT 2.2). Parties can be an organization or divisions of organizations. REVVA utilizes four different categories of parties. The first one is the customer or the organization that  uses a M&S solution. The second is the supplier or the developer of a M&S solution. The third category is a third party VV&A agent, an external and independent VV&A organization. The last party is the acceptance authority or an external and independent trustful organization.Actors from the above parties can play various roles in the REVVA generic process. Each of these roles are described in terms of required knowledge and skills to complete the assigned tasks, the actor’s authority and responsibility in the process, and the interaction with other roles. The major active VV&A roles identified by the REVVA methodology are the end-user, acceptance leader, V&V leader and V&V executioners. Besides these roles also affected roles are defined, which are those actors taking advantage of the REVVA methodology but are not directly involved in the implementation of the REVVA generic process.Pillar Two: The Generic ProcessThe heart of the REVVA methodology is the generic process model. This VV&A process model consists of seven iterative phases that lead to official acceptance of a M&S solution for the intended purpose. Each phase is defined in terms of activities that have to be performed plus the involved roles and their type of involvement in these activities. The process also specifies both the input and output products for each phase (Paragraph  REF _Ref137103391 \r \h 2.3).  The generic process starts with the development of  the target of Acceptance (ToA) based upon the intended purpose of the M&S solution. In the second phase all available information about the system of interest and the simulation model is acquired. This knowledge is used and improved in all the other phases. From the ToA a Target of Validation and Verification (ToVV) is developed in phase three. Using the ToVV, the actual validation and verification is conducted in phase four, which followed in phase five by the assessment of the probative force of these V&V results. The results of this last phase are combined in phase six to assess whether the acceptance criteria in the ToA are passed. Based upon these outcomes a recommendation whether to accept or reject the M&S product is developed in phase seven. A full description of the generic process model phases can be found in  REF _Ref137103448 \r \h [12].Pillar Three: The ProductsThe third REVVA pillar is a description of all products developed in the above presented generic process model. In this paper only the four REVVA products are discussed that are relevant in the context of fidelity assessment.The Model Information and System Knowledge is used as the basis to determine whether the simulation has a correct and valid representation of the system of interest. It is a collection of knowledge of both the real system and the simulation model identified and available during the VV&A process. So far the REVVA methodology only provides a very high level of classification of types and how information could be specified. The Target of Acceptance (ToA) and the Target of Validation & Verification (ToVV) together with the Items of Evidence (IoE) form the core and most innovative part of the REVVA methodology. VV&A efforts address the question whether a simulation representation of reality fits its intended purpose  REF _Ref135732614 \r \h [6]  REF _Ref422533265 \r \h [8]. A ToA is a directed acyclic graph of (sub)objectives with its root being the intended purpose statement and its leaves being precise measurable acceptability criteria ( REF _Ref137704017 \h  \* MERGEFORMAT Figure 21). In this sense the ToA specifies what must be assessed in terms of measures of effectiveness (MoE). Furthermore, the ToA states for each acceptability criterion the impact on its parent nodes up to the intended purpose if the criterion isn’t met. A more detailed description of the ToA can be found in  REF _Ref136418738 \r \h [4].Like the ToA the ToVV is a directed acyclic graph with its roots being the acceptability criteria of the ToA. The ToVV specifies how for each acceptability criteria it is demonstrated whether a criteria is or isn’t met. Compared to the ToA the focus of the ToVV is not on the user but on the internal model and simulation system structure, their characteristics and behavior. The leaf-nodes of the ToVV specify what V&V tasks have to be performed and what items of evidence, in terms of Measures of Performance (MoP), need to be collected. Figure  STYLEREF 1 \s 2 SEQ Figure \* ARABIC \s 1 1 ToA, ToVV and IoE relationshipsThe IoE resulting from the executed ToVV tasks provide all the evidence for the claim that an acceptability criterion has passed. To substantiate such a claim it is necessary that for each item of evidence a judgment of it’s probative force is stated. Based upon the integration of these IoEs and their probative force it can be assessed how convincingly the collected evidence for the acceptability criteria states that the criteria have passed. A more detailed presentation of the IoE in relationship with to the ToVV and ToA can found in references  REF _Ref136418738 \r \h [4],  REF _Ref137098089 \r \h [10] and  REF _Ref137103448 \r \h [12].The TNO Fidelity MethodologyFrom their collaborative research into distributed simulation technology, TNO and the Delft University of Technology (DUT) developed concerns regarding fidelity in relationship to the credibility, reuse and interoperability of simulations. Concerns similar to those expressed elsewhere in the M&S community. This resulted in two fidelity study groups sponsored by SISO  REF _Ref422533265 \r \h [8]  REF _Ref136420891 \r \h [15]. Based upon their participation in these study groups and their own experience, TNO together with DUT embarked on  a new fundamental research project on simulation fidelity theory and practice  REF _Ref137711936 \r \h [13]  REF _Ref137712177 \r \h [14]  REF _Ref137712179 \r \h [16]  REF _Ref137711966 \r \h [17]. This research eventually resulted in a common fidelity methodology (TNO-FM) to systematically define, specify and measure simulation fidelity. This section gives a brief overview of the fidelity methodology. For a complete description the reader is referred to  REF _Ref137098089 \r \h [10].Fidelity Definition, Concepts and PrinciplesAs shown by the SISO fidelity study group results there exist many connotations of what is considered to be the fidelity of a simulation. The common denominator in all these fidelity connotations is the ability to make a comparison between reality and the simulated reality and a specification of the degree of correspondence between both. It is this specification that is often called the degree of realism and this is considered within TNO-FM as the most conceptual right for the term fidelity. Based upon this premise fidelity is define by the TNO-FM as: ‘the inverse difference between reality and simulated reality’. A very compact and context free formulation for fidelity, which explicitly captures the essential principle underlying its measurement; which is the comparative analysis between reality and simulated reality. The inverse difference satisfies the normal apprehension that high fidelity implies a small difference. Figure  STYLEREF 1 \s 3 SEQ Figure \* ARABIC \s 1 1 Esoteric versus pragmatic fidelityA practical implementation of this fidelity definition is never attainable in real-life. The main reason for this is the limited human capability to directly and objectively compare reality against the simulated reality through his own sensory systems or some technical equipment. This means that fidelity can only be measured indirectly by a comparative analysis of knowledge specifications for both reality and simulated reality. A knowledge specification is always the result of a process that comprises observation, experimentation, processing, abstraction, interpretation and specification. Such a process is always error prone and will contain uncertainties. Uncertainty in this regard is characterized as incomplete or lacking information, which limits the exact correctness with which any kind of real-world knowledge can be known  REF _Ref137739125 \r \h [11]  REF _Ref137739152 \r \h [20]. Reality and simulated reality are thus knowledge sources. This yields a weaker but pragmatic definition for fidelity being, ‘The formal specification of the inverse difference between the referent and the simulation knowledge specification’. It is this definition of fidelity that is used as the basis of the TNO-FM. The difference between both fidelity formulations is visualized in  REF _Ref137801124 \h  \* MERGEFORMAT Figure 31.In this formulation of fidelity the referent is a codified, structured and formal specification of the real entity that is simulated. This concept of the fidelity referent is similar to the one developed by the SISO study groups  REF _Ref422533265 \r \h [8]. The TNO-FM provides a generic template for a referent, which builds upon Zeigler’s hierarchy of system knowledge specification and complemented with additional elements for managing its contents  REF _Ref137711966 \r \h [17]  REF _Ref137796321 \r \h [24]. The simulation system knowledge specification is concept  similar to the fidelity referent except it contains knowledge about the simulation system itself and its representation of reality. A description of the associated TNO-FM template for this knowledge specification can be found in  REF _Ref135732650 \r \h [18]. Fidelity measurement now becomes an activity of quantifying and qualifying the inverse difference between both knowledge specifications and the assessment of the errors and uncertainties related to these inverse differences. This formulation of fidelity (F) is formally expressed in the TNO-FM by the following sextuple:        EMBED Equation.3  In here  EMBED Equation.3   is a set containing all practical available and applicable fidelity evaluator functions that quantify and/or qualify the difference between the referent (Rref) and simulation knowledge specification (Sspec). Fidelity evaluator functions are the implementation of one of TNO-FM’s twelve basic theorems which state that fidelity is not a singular value but an enumeration of various multidimensional and multifaceted metrics.  EMBED Equation.3   is the set of inverse proportional scaled differences resulting from executing all fidelity evaluator functions in  EMBED Equation.3  ,  EMBED Equation.3   and  EMBED Equation.3   are respectively the error and uncertainty of each measured (inverse) difference.Fidelity Characterization and TaxonomyThe application of Zeigler’s hierarchal system knowledge specification in the TNO-FM enables a uniform and coherent characterization of fidelity at different levels of abstraction or (de)composition. This results in a fidelity characterization in terms of the next eight descriptive concepts: detail, resolution, accuracy, interaction, temporality, causality, precision and sensitivity  REF _Ref422533265 \r \h [8]  REF _Ref136420891 \r \h [15]  REF _Ref137711966 \r \h [17]. Together, these concepts outline the basis for the development of practical fidelity evaluator functions or in short fidelity metrics. The TNO-FM comprises a basic taxonomy with the most common and elementary fidelity metrics. Top down the taxonomy classifies fidelity metrics into quantitative and qualitative metrics ( REF _Ref137814519 \h  \* MERGEFORMAT Figure 32). Each class is subdivided in structural and behavioral metrics.Figure  STYLEREF 1 \s 3 SEQ Figure \* ARABIC \s 1 2 The TNO-FM fidelity metrics taxonomyStructural fidelity metrics objectively characterize and quantify the simulation fidelity in terms of resolution or the level of detail. These metrics are the most course grained metrics to quantify the difference between reality and simulated reality in terms of whether (sub)systems and/or their characteristics properties and interactions are represented by the model or simulation.Behavioral oriented fidelity metrics focus on the pair-wise comparison between the specified behavioral knowledge found in the fidelity referent and the simulation system specification knowledge base. These metrics and methods objectively characterize and quantify the simulation fidelity in terms of accuracy of the behavioral replication of the complete real-world system and/or its subsystems. Following a similar approach as proposed by Birta  REF _Ref137813480 \r \h [3], the behavioral fidelity metrics are further catalogued by the taxonomy in the following four categories: non-causal system behavior, behavior samples, ordinary causal and logical relationships, and interaction causality metrics.Although quantitative metrics are preferred, the use of qualitative or subject matter expert (SME) based methods and metrics are usually inevitable. These qualitative metrics are structured in the taxonomy according to three categories ( REF _Ref137814519 \h  \* MERGEFORMAT Figure 32) in which both real-world referent and simulation system knowledge is elicited and interrelated by an SME. Furthermore, the TNO-FM provides a formal and systematic approach, consisting of several statistical analysis methods and expertise level ratings, to increase the reliability and repeatability of subjective SME evaluations. Useful TNO-FM Results for REVVABoth the TNO-FM and the REVVA do propose full methodologies for VV&A. Since REVVA is still under development and targeted for larger user community, the concepts and results of the TNO-FM can be used to fill some of the current blanks in REVVA. Hereby, improving the REVVA methodology. The next paragraphs discuss how the TNO-FM results can address the following open issues in REVVA. There exist in REVVA:No formal definition for validity.No precise definition for all REVVA products.No aids to integrate evidence in the ToA/ToVV.Validity in terms of Fidelity Requirements Fidelity and validity are closely related but are no synonyms. Comparison of the TNO-FM definition for fidelity and the commonly known definitions for simulation validity  REF _Ref135732599 \n \h  \* MERGEFORMAT [2]  REF _Ref135732614 \n \h  \* MERGEFORMAT [6]  REF _Ref135733285 \n \h  \* MERGEFORMAT [7], allows for expressing validity in terms of fidelity as follows: ‘A simulation is considered to be valid if its level of fidelity is sufficient for its intended purpose’. This implies that a model or simulation is said to be valid when the actual achieved level of fidelity meets the required level of fidelity. In this section the formal TNO-FM definition for fidelity requirements is presented along with two other VV&A related fidelity concepts: fidelity measure of performance and effectiveness.The development of a simulation system, like any other system, starts with the identification of the user needs that arise from a problem, question or deficiency (Section  REF _Ref137103391 \r \h 2.3). Besides the regular (non)functional requirements a simulation has a special class of requirements, which specify the required real-world representational and behavioral capabilities to achieve the users needs. These kind of requirements are know as fidelity requirements  REF _Ref422533265 \r \h [8]. Based upon the formal definition of fidelity presented in paragraph  REF _Ref138652897 \r \h 3.1, fidelity requirements (Frequired)in the TNO-FM are formally defined by the following triplet: EMBED Equation.DSMT4  Where  EMBED Equation.DSMT4   is the required fidelity referent. This is an essential element since it specifies how and from what sources the real-world reference knowledge is elicited, and what the quality of this real-world knowledge should be in terms of allowed error and uncertainty. The second element,  EMBED Equation.3  , is the set of required fidelity evaluator functions, which covers those real-world aspects that have to be evaluated or measured during the simulation fidelity specification of the target simulation system. The last element,  EMBED Equation.3  , is the set of fidelity tolerances, which specify for each fidelity evaluator function the tolerated deviations of the simulated representations and behaviors from its fidelity referent counterparts. These tolerances are specified in terms of an upper ubound and lower bound lbound. Together the  fidelity tolerances enclose an n-dimensional space inside which all measured deviations from the fidelity referent must reside to properly fulfil the simulation application purpose. Hereby validity in the context of simulation becomes a transparent Boolean proposition in terms of the fidelity adjectives required and available, which is either true or false. For a fictive one-dimensional fidelity case validity reduces to the following Boolean proposition: EMBED Equation.DSMT4  This Boolean proposition is true when the measured difference between the required fidelity referent  and the available simulated reality  EMBED Equation.DSMT4   resides within the required fidelity tolerances. Fidelity Templates for REVVA productsAs discussed in paragraph  REF _Ref137103391 \r \h 2.3. the model and system knowledge specification is one of the essential REVVA products.  Except for a top-level description its is up to the REVVA user to define how and what knowledge should be specified. The TNO-FM real-world reference and simulation system knowledge specification together serve a similar purpose and do contain similar types of knowledge. Within TNO-FM both these products are defined by means of advanced and interrelated template structures  REF _Ref137711966 \r \h [17] REF _Ref135732650 \r \h [18]. Compared to REVVA these templates provide the user much more details on what and how knowledge must be collected and structured. Furthermore, these templates are easily translated in equivalent spread sheets and XML-DTD’s for support tool implementations. At the terminal nodes of the ToA/ToVV a clear task description is needed of what and how IoE’s must be elicited and evaluated. So far REVVA lacks guidelines on how to formulate these tasks. These tasks are similar to defining fidelity requirements in the TNO-FM as was  described in the previous paragraph. The TNO-FM also provides a detailed template structure for this purpose  along with a set of guidelines to populated this structure  REF _Ref137712177 \r \h  \* MERGEFORMAT [14]. To this extend, the TNO-FM furthermore provides a taxonomy of fidelity metrics (Paragraph  REF _Ref139949591 \r \h 3.2) that serves as a repository of readily to be used measures. Measures which provide well defined fidelity IoE’s in a quantified fashion for the ToA/ToVV.Fidelity Effectiveness for Integrating EvidenceIn M&S it is common practice that one often has to evaluate several models or simulation system for their validity. Usually certain parts of the fidelity requirements are not fully met by a single model or simulation. In other words there isn’t a perfect alternative that meets the validity proposition outlined in paragraph  REF _Ref141599898 \r \h 4.1. Therefore, one has to select the simulation alternative that best fits the fidelity requirements instead. This selection not only involves the integration of fidelity measurement outcomes at different aggregation levels of interest but also evaluation of the relative importance of each fidelity requirement in achieving the intended simulation purpose. Although REVVA is focused at the front-end validity and acceptability of simulations, the way in which evidence is aggregated through the ToA/ToVV is comparable to the TNO-FM approach for aggregating fidelity scores.In TNO-FM the found fidelity outcomes are aggregated by means of the so-called fidelity effectiveness measure  EMBED Equation.DSMT4  . This dimensionless score characterizes the degree of validity of the alternatives, i.e. how effectively the available fidelity of a simulation and/or its constituent components suit the given specific set of fidelity requirements. The basis for this fidelity effectiveness is a rating function,  EMBED Equation.DSMT4  , which specifies how well each fidelity evaluator function result meets its associated required tolerances.  The range of any fidelity effectiveness rating function must vary from one to zero. A value of one indicates that the requirement is fully achieved. The higher the effectiveness rating the better fulfillment of the requirement. Therefore a Fidelity effectiveness rating function provides a means to rate the impact or severity of the relaxation of fidelity tolerances in the simulation application purpose context. Some typical examples of such rating functions are shown below.Figure  STYLEREF 1 \s 4 SEQ Figure \* ARABIC \s 1 1 Fidelity effectiveness rating function SamplesUsing the fidelity rating function the fidelity effectiveness is formally specified as follows: EMBED Equation.DSMT4  			In here wj is defined as the jth weight of the normalized relative importance weight vector for the ith fidelity evaluator function output vector: EMBED Equation.DSMT4  			These weights are assigned by means of SME judgments using the Saaty’s pair-wise comparison scale  REF _Ref139028032 \r \h [1]. Fidelity effectiveness measures can be constructed on various aggregation levels and for different sub-areas of interest within the context of a specific simulation purpose. Therefore, fidelity effectiveness measures provide a useful means to assist in integrating evidence within the ToA/ToVV structure.Applying TNO-FM Products in REVVA The TNO-FM provides a management process model, which specifies a series of practical guidelines to assist in developing and applying the previously discussed TNO-FM results  REF _Ref139681263 \r \h [13]  REF _Ref135732650 \r \h [18]. Base-upon this model this section discusses how the TNO-FM products can be applied in the REVVA process.Develop a ToA, ToVV and Acquire InformationFrom a fidelity perspective the first three phases of the generic REVVA process primarily comprise the development and formal specification of the simulation fidelity requirements. The REVVA process starts with the ToA development by identifying the objectives from the intended purpose of the simulation. These objectives can be expressed in terms of abstract fidelity acceptability criteria, which give an initial textual specification of the fidelity that’s required. The recommended practice from the TNO-FM for this phase is the specification of the simulation experimental frame in terms of the simulation execution scenarios with the help of the customer party. This is because scenario’s identify the major and coarse-grained structural, behavioral and other functional aspects of the desired real-world from a situational and operational perspective. These scenario’s form the starting point for acquiring all required information and knowledge about the reality to be simulated to populate the fidelity referent. Acquiring information about reality is a separate phase in the current version of the REVVA process. Recommended practices and experiences with the TNO-FM show that elicitation of real-world knowledge for a fidelity referent is not a sequential activity. Instead it is an iterative process which is best conducted concurrently throughout the whole ToA/ToVV hierarchy development. The type and quality of the fidelity referent knowledge is selected according to the prioritized objectives in the ToA. This also involves assessing the nature, magnitude and impact of possible uncertainties  EMBED Equation.3   and errors  EMBED Equation.3  . With the use of the first version of the fidelity referent the fidelity effectiveness measures can be identified or developed from the fidelity acceptability criteria at the bottom of the ToA. Depending on the type and complexity of such a fidelity acceptability can be either directly specified as a ToVV fidelity effectiveness node with the underlying fidelity evaluator functions (IoE) or decomposed into a hierarchy of derived fidelity effectiveness nodes. In the latter case a relative importance weight allocation must be made to properly aggregate the result of each separate fidelity effectiveness node into a parent node. Furthermore, suitable fidelity tolerance must be allocated along fidelity effectiveness rating functions that specify the impact and severity of not fully meeting the tolerances. Both activities depend on the evaluation and associated risks analysis with respect to the parent objectives and intended simulation purpose.Next for each fidelity evaluator function the exact measurement activities are specified. Which comprises aspects such as what referent data is used, how the simulated data is acquired, initial and post conditions and metric algorithm description. If this activity is completed a full set of fidelity requirements has been developed in the form of a REVVA ToA/ToVV structure ( REF _Ref139784750 \h  \* MERGEFORMAT Figure 51).Figure  STYLEREF 1 \s 5 SEQ Figure \* ARABIC \s 1 1  A Fidelity based ToA/ToVVConduct V&V, Asses and Integrate EvidenceThe first three phases of the generic REVVA process develop a fidelity based ToA/ToVV structure in a more or less top-down fashion. Summarized this ToA/ToVV structure specifies the all fidelity requirements needed to obtain a valid and acceptable simulation for the costumer’s intended purpose. Phases four to seven of the REVVA process traverse the ToA/ToVV structure backwards and starts at the bottom with the actual fidelity measurement itself, which is know in RVVA as conducting V&V. This activity comprises the simulation system execution according to the test description of eachfidelity evaluator function  EMBED Equation.3   in the ToA/ToVV. The resulting simulation data are then compared to the fidelity referent counterparts by means of the metric associated with each fidelity evaluator function. The outcome of these metrics  EMBED Equation.3   provides the fidelity items of evidence (IoE) for how well a simulation replicates a real entity or system i.e. the level of available fidelity. Before fidelity measurements are accepted as items of evidence, the actual errors  EMBED Equation.3   and uncertainties  EMBED Equation.3   encountered in the measurement process must be assessed. This provides essential information necessary to evaluate the probative force of each fidelity IoE. Next the individual items of evidence are aggregated and expressed by the fidelity effectiveness measures in the ToVV. In here a value of one indicates that the fidelity acceptability criteria is met, i.e. fidelity is within the tolerance. The closer the fidelity effectiveness outcome approaches zero the less effective the fidelity acceptability criteria is met. If all fidelity MoE’s in the ToVV have a value of one the simulation is said to have a sufficient level of fidelity for its application purpose. How strong this validity statement is depends upon the convincing force of the ToVV. The convincing force of each fidelity effectiveness outcome is based upon the aggregated evaluation of the probative force of each contributing fidelity IoE. It is yet hard to provide a mature and formal technique for this purpose. Therefore, the TNO-FM uses a formal SME review process to evaluate the credibility of the validity proposition based upon the relative importance weights of each fidelity effectiveness measure together with the fidelity uncertainty and error characterizations  REF _Ref135732650 \r \h [18]. A Practical Simulation Case-Study In the north-east of the Netherlands a training village "Marnehuizen" has been constructed for live simulation based training of MOUT operations of army personnel. The training involves group coordination at platoon and company level with various organic vehicles and weapon systems. Currently it is difficult to follow and quantify the performance of trainees during live practice. Observers in the training area are necessary for recording events during the course of the training. These observers may have an influence on the development of the simulation scenario, and moreover, the events during the training take place in different locations, complicating the work of the observer. To address these issues TNO Defense, Security and Safety has built a highly detailed digital terrain database of the training village areas. This terrain database is going to be used as a 3D synthetic environment and stealth viewing federate to observe and score the performance of the trainees during the simulation exercise. Furthermore, the federate will also be used for after action review of simulation exercises. The development of the ToA/ToVV for the Marnehuizen federate started with interviews of the employees (the users) of this training facility  REF _Ref140488651 \n \h [23]. From these interviews and a scenario(s) review session the following user-purpose or top goal has been formulated: The Marnehuizen federate terrain database is suited for performance evaluation of training exercises in the Marnehuizen facility. Next in several brainstorm sessions with a SME and the TNO project team a complete ToA hierarchy and a first fidelity referent was developed. In here a rather subjective and heuristic approach has been used to assign rather coarse grained fidelity tolerances and relative importance weights to each ToA node. Similarly, the allowed fidelity uncertainties for each node claim were established. The complete resulting ToA consists of multiple nodes on four aggregation levels and eleven fidelity related acceptability criteria (AC). For brevity only the following fidelity AC is considered here: To facilitate easy recognition of the situation during the training exercise the Marnehuizen federate data-base must resemble the real Marnehuizen terrain very well.Before a measurable fidelity effectiveness measures could be assigned to this and the other fidelity AC’s, each AC had to be expanded into a ToVV with high-level and compound fidelity measures, fidelity evaluator functions  (IoE’s) and evaluation task descriptions. This required substantial help of several SME’s, who are very well know with the real terrain. During this effort the fidelity referent was improved with newly identified data. Furthermore, since the impact of not meeting these criteria are very significant for the intended purpose the fidelity effectiveness measure of each AC should score at least 0.9  with a maximum residual uncertainty of 0.1 to be accepted as valid i.e. have sufficient level of fidelity.The final ToVV for the fidelity AC considered here consists of eight necessary fidelity IoE’s to be checked. In this paper two of those required fidelity IoE’s are considered:All relevant objects in Marnehuizen terrain must be represented in the Marnehuizen federate data-base. The height profile of the federate data-base must match that of the Marnehuizen terrain. Based upon a list of sixteen referent object types that are present in the real Marnehuizen terrain, two types of system level resolution evaluator functions were assigned to fidelity IoE one (Paragraph  REF _Ref139949591 \r \h 3.2). The first one is the total system scope difference which is formally written as: EMBED Equation.DSMT4  This fidelity metric specifies on a scale axis from zero to one how many objects in total are represented by the terrain data-base (Sdb). The second one is the partial object scope difference which has the same mathematical structure but instead evaluates how many of each type of terrain objects are represented.Next the SME was asked to assign relative importance weights to each type of object with respect to their contribution in the recognizability of the terrain. This outcome was then used to assign the tolerated deviation in presence of the number of objects and to construct the fidelity effectiveness functions. The SME judged that if the evaluator function results were outside the fidelity tolerance band its effectiveness rating must be zero. Together with the importance weights the evaluator functions were combined in a single fidelity effectiveness measure for fidelity IoE one (Paragraph  REF _Ref139949303 \r \h 4.2). According the SME the maximum residual uncertainty for this fidelity effectiveness must not exceed the value of 0.1For the second fidelity IoE two types of evaluator functions from the sample pair accuracy category in the TNO-FM fidelity metrics taxonomy (Paragraph  REF _Ref139949591 \r \h 3.2) were chosen and combined in a fidelity effectiveness measure for the terrain profile fidelity. The first one is the absolute maximum elevation difference evaluation function:         EMBED Equation.DSMT4  In this case the maximum difference between the real and the terrain data-base elevation profile grid point (gp) on a grids-size of one meter is measured. The second fidelity metric is the integrated absolute difference of the terrain slope at each grid point:        EMBED Equation.DSMT4  Both metrics are chosen such that they both return a dimensionless value between zero and one. A value of one indicates perfect replication of the terrain properties. Again a SME was asked to specify the fidelity tolerances for both accuracy metrics being respectively absolute maximum different of 0.2 meter and integrated slope deviation of 1%. Furthermore, the SME assigned the following importance weights respectively: 0.8 and 0.2. The same residual uncertainty for this fidelity effectiveness measure was chosen as for the previous fidelity effectiveness measure. However, for both fidelity metrics a fidelity effectiveness rating function with a block shape was chosen ( REF _Ref139959655 \h  \* MERGEFORMAT Figure 41) with the following rating scheme:d2.1>0.7d2.1 <0.8d2.1 <0.80.00.51d2.2 >0.33d2.2 >0.66d2.2 <0.660.00.81Table  SEQ Table \* ARABIC 1 Fidelity Effectiveness RatingsBy executing the previously described fidelity evaluation task and aggregating the results into the fidelity effectiveness measures a final score could be calculated for each of the two fidelity acceptability criteria. The first fidelity IoE scored 0.75 and the second fidelity IoE scored 0.95, both with an aggregated uncertainty of 0.05. The aggregation was based upon SME and TNO project team estimations and educated guesses. These results were then aggregated with the other six IoE to make a validity statement for the stated complete “recognizability” acceptability criteria. Although one fidelity tolerance wasn’t met it was judged by the SME’s and the users that the impact on the total recognizability was acceptable for the application purpose.Conclusions and Future Work                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     This paper presented a brief overview of the current version of the WEAG THALES Joint Program 11.20 VV&A methodology, or in short REVVA. The REVVA methodology provides a common integrated set of VV&A methods, techniques and standards to assess the validity of simulation systems. Next an introduction to the TNO Fidelity Methodology (TNO-FM) has been discussed, which is a methodology to systematically define, specify and measure simulation fidelity. This discussion showed that it is possible to specify simulation validity in terms of fidelity. The concept of fidelity requirements has been introduced as the linking pin between fidelity and validity. Based upon a formal definition of fidelity requirements and the presented taxonomy of fidelity evaluator functions the concept of fidelity effectiveness measure was introduced. Then it was shown how these TNO-FM concepts and products can be used to more precisely define the REVVA’s main elements (ToA/ToVV) and be integrated within the REVVA generic process. A small case-study was presented to illustrate and investigate the benefits of combining both methodologies.The major lessons learned from this integration exercise and case-study are the following:The REVVA itself lacks precise definitions for the elements in the ToA and ToVV. The templates of the TNO-FM products like fidelity referent, requirements and fidelity effectiveness measures provide a possible and useful means to fill this void.(De)Aggregation of all information in the ToA/ToVV structure is not a sinecure. Although the TNO-FM fidelity products improve this, it still remains a highly subjective and informal process. (particularly, in the area of aggregating  the probative force of each item of evidence underlying the ToA acceptance criteria.)Developing this fidelity-based ToA/ToVV proved not to be a water-fall process but a spiral development in which step-by-step fidelity tolerances, uncertainties, referent, MoE’s, MoP’s and evaluator functions are found and refined in conjunction to each other. Building a ToA/ToVV tree, even for the presented small case-study, becomes rapidly very large and complex. To keep the Marnehuizen fidelity-based ToA/ToVV well-ordered and manageable the TNO project team used the Assurance and Safety Case Environment (ASCE) tool of Adelard. The TNO-FM fidelity case-study showed that the REVVA process proves to be a generic framework that allows for tailoring and extension of its products to improve the VV&A process. However, this might  also a drawback for future users.Currently, TNO Defense, Safety and Security participates in the REVVA follow-up project, REVVA2, to further improve the REVVA with the lessons-learned from this TNO case-study. In this context also the TNO-FM will be reviewed and its integration within the REVVA generic process will be studied in more detail.ReferencesBalci O., ‘A Methodology for Certification of Modeling and Simulation Applications’.
