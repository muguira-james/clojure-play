TENA will encompass a common architecture, a core set of tools, inter-range communication capabilities, interfaces to existing range assets, interfaces to weapon systems, and recommended procedures for conducting distributed test events or training exercises.  Millennium Challenge 02 (MC02) was a July/August 02 Joint Forces Command (JFCOM) led Joint Experiment that sought to explore and define a concept known as "Rapid Decisive Operations" (RDO).  This concept is intended to enable Joint Forces to better deal with and forestall the often unexpected and asymmetric challenges of modern warfare.  MC02 is the first such event to make extensive use of the robust data capabilities of Ranges to provide "ground truth" information to the JFCOM "white cell", thus providing the ability to match the positional, timing, performance reports of the operational systems with independent, measured information via the Ranges.  Achieving such interoperability quickly and affordably presented technical, programmatic and cultural challenges.  Early on, the Ranges made a decision to utilize the TENA prototype middleware, known as IKE 2 although the first release of the middleware was still several months in the future.  This decision was based on the conviction that the Ranges' own TENA architecture was vital to Ranges being able to function as cost effective partners in future Joint Experimentation.  The participating Ranges modified existing DIS to HLA gateway software to work with IKE 2 and, in addition, developed a new gateway capability with their own object model.  Team members from both the FI 2010 "Developmental Test Cells" and the FI 2010 Cadre provided advice and technical assistance to both the Range and JFCOM efforts.  Joint Experimentation is a relatively new area for both simulation and live.  Yet it is clearly having a major impact on warfighting, acquisition, test and training.  This first instance of live Ranges in a Joint Experiment needs to be understood and studied to determine the best utilization in the future and contributions toward the evolving concept for a Joint National Training Center.IntroductionJoint Experimentation live/simulation needsThe United States Joint Forces Command (JFCOM) is the unified command responsible for continental United States (CONUS) joint forces training and interoperability training.  Joint Experiments allow JFCOM to examine and evaluate future warfighting concepts.   Modeling and Simulation (M&S) plays a major role in such assessments.  Live Ranges, with their capability to provide ground truth data and human-in-the-loop open-air interaction, would seem to be an inherent part of the Joint Experimentation process. However, because synergy between the various systems and command and control (C2) in Joint warfighting scenarios is exceedingly costly and difficult to test, evaluate and train in any single facility or Range, live Ranges/facilities have been minimal players in Joint Experimentation.More recently, JFCOM has been further tasked to plan the development of a ‚ÄúJoint National Training Center‚Äù (JNTC) whose training focus is to assure warfighting interoperability among the Services.  The current approach at JFCOM to developing this major capability involves making constructive use of Joint Experiments and joint training exercises as development and assessment venues.  While the JNTC tasking to JFCOM is relatively new, the concept of an integrated distributed training environment centered on live players has been a consistent theme at JFCOM.Test and Evaluation, Training Live/Simulation NeedsIn test and evaluation (T&E), simulation is vital to initial systems test activities and training events.  In both T&E and Training, a mixture of live- and simulation-driven test and training events are becoming more commonplace across the acquisition process and through the system life cycle due to costs and the logistics of supporting events consisting of entirely-live forces and systems. Foundation Initiative 2010 The Foundation Initiative 2010 project exists to promote the interoperable use of test and training range systems and is committed to such multi-domain integration.  FI 2010 is developing the products to ensure that needed legacy Range capabilities are adapted and future investments are designed to be interoperable in support of these future warfighting scenarios.  The FI 2010 project‚Äôs development of the Test and Training Enabling Range Architecture (TENA) is prototyping, developing, and standardizing the software and interfaces needed to achieve a significantly greater level of interoperability and reuse of live and simulated resources throughout the Range community [1]. The vision of FI 2010 is to enable interoperability among ranges, facilities and simulations in a quick and cost-efficient manner, and to foster reuse of range assets and future range system developments.   To achieve this vision, FI 2010 is developing and validating a common architecture (TENA), a core set of tools, inter-range communication capabilities, interfaces to existing range assets, interfaces to weapon systems, and a Concept of Operations (ConOps) which provides recommended procedures for conducting synthetic test events or training exercises.   The TENA specifies both a common Object Model (OM) that defines the data and functionality of range resources and a common middleware that defines the mechanism for range resources to interact.  Essentially, the TENA middleware is the component that is in between (i.e., in the middle of) range resources.  Implementation of TENA will greatly enhance a range or facility‚Äôs capability to interoperate with resources at or from other ranges or facilities.  The primary benefit of TENA is the ability it gives exercise planners to rapidly compose TENA-compliant applications into a geographically distributed ‚ÄúLogical Range‚Äù for a range event.  TENA applications (also called ‚ÄúTENA Resources‚Äù), tools, repositories, and gateways use the TENA middleware as their means of communication.  The TENA applications can function over both organic DoD wide-area networks and commercial communication services.  The FI 2010 project will develop interfaces necessary for existing range resources to become TENA-compliant.  The interfaces will cost-effectively enable current range infrastructure to be adapted to this common architecture, rather than require that replacement systems be developed.   Millennium Challenge 02 Millennium Challenge 02 (MC02) was a Congressionally mandated, Secretary of Defense directed, JFCOM sponsored large scale, live and simulated, joint field experiment that was executed between 24 July and 15 August 2002.  MC02 depicted a fictitious Area of Responsibility (AOR) called US Millennium Challenge 02 Command (USMCO2COM).   Actual experiment sites stretched from the Joint Training and Analysis, Simulation Center (JTASC) in Suffolk, Virginia to the Western test and training ranges in California.  ‚ÄúRapid Decisive Operations‚Äù (RDO) as a future warfare methodology was the central experimental concept.  RDO will integrate knowledge, C2, and operations to achieve the desired political/military effect.  Rather than restricting themselves to only applying military capabilities to an adversary, under the RDO concept, military planners work with and leverage other agencies and instruments of national power to limit an adversary‚Äôs capabilities.  Such integration of asynchronous capabilities requires an unprecedented level of coordination among normally disparate organizations and capabilities. Figure 3.1 illustrates how the Joint coordinated attack would take place using traditional methodologies. The qualities most noticeable in this approach are its linearity and predictability.Figure 3.1 Traditional Joint Operations MethodologiesFigure 3.2 depicts the unpredictability (from the adversary‚Äôs perspective) of the RDO methodology.Figure 3.2 Future Joint Operations with Rapid Decisive Operation MethodologiesIn this case the attacks on the adversary come from different quarters, against a greater variety of targets and mostly from forward forces.  It is non-linear in nature. The size and dispersion of the Western Ranges provide a useful and realistic ‚Äúplaybox‚Äù for the live players.  It then becomes critical to have independent ground truth to check the operational links that are reporting the live (and simulated) players back to the Warfighters or the white cell as appropriate. Service ParticipantsService experiments included the Army‚Äôs Medium Weight Brigade, the Navy‚Äôs ‚ÄúForward from the Sea‚Äù, U.S. Marine Corps ‚ÄúExpeditionary Maneuver Warfare‚Äù (EMW), and the Air Force‚Äôs ‚ÄúExpeditionary Aerospace Forces‚Äù.  Joint and Service experimental objectives drove the scenario development, force requirements, and task organization to a large degree.  U.S. Navy Fleet Battle Experiment - Juliet (FBE J) occurred concurrently with MC02 and supported MC02‚Äôs Future Joint Operation vignettes in addition to the FBE J events.To achieve its goals, MC02 needed to include both simulated and live forces.  In MC02, C2 decision centers and operational C2 systems were provided to both the participants and the evaluators.  These live C2 networks were stimulated by a mix of simulated forces, including simulated Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensors, and live forces (with real ISR sensors).  Experiment control and ground truth situational awareness were enhanced through separate live range instrumentation systems providing independent live forces ‚Äúground truth‚Äù maneuver histories to the MC02 control centers.  Both test and training ranges were used to support this functionality.  This live test and training range integration of instrumentation-based representation of the live vehicles and platforms in MC02 was the first operational use of TENA in Joint Experimentation.4.  Range Integration In MC024.1 Overall and JFCOM Range Integration objectivesAt the MC02 Initial Planning Conference (16-19 July 01) the JFCOM planners noted that the overall objectives of this Joint Experiment were to:‚Äúbuild upon past efforts and advance the concepts that will rapidly co-evolve enhanced joint capabilities for conducting rapid, decisive, joint operations in a 2007 timeframe‚Äù and‚Äúemphasize the integration of innovations in doctrine, organization, training, material, leadership, personnel and facilities that enhance the future  joint force commander‚Äôs operational level command and control‚Äù.JFCOM working with an initial representative group of Ranges, developed a White Paper entitled ‚ÄúRange Integration in Support of MC02 Exercise Objectives‚Äù[2] that designated the following supporting objectives for this initial use of Ranges in a Joint Experiment:‚ÄúDemonstrate potential linkage of Western Ranges to show feasibility for the purposes of joint training and experimentation‚Äù, and ‚ÄúDemonstrate integration of live and simulated actions in an environment that feeds situational awareness at the operational level‚Äù.This was to be a first step in the process of making effective use of live ranges in Joint Experiments.The intent was to gradually increase the role of and utilization of the capabilities at the Ranges over the upcoming Joint Experiments.  Figure 4.1 illustrates the series of anticipated Joint Experiments and their focus areas.For MC02, the initial step for Ranges in this process, the decision was made to focus on being able to provide Time Space Positional Information (TSPI) tracks as ground truth of entities operating on the Ranges.  This ground truth could then be used by the Joint Experiment Control Group (JECG) or ‚Äúwhite cell‚Äù to compare to the tracks being reported by the C4ISR systems upon which the Warfighters were basing their decisions.  The ground truth TSPI from the Ranges was NOT made available to the Warfighting teams.  However, the insight provided by this ground truth was predicted to aid the JECG and other analysts in determining causality and perhaps the rationale of decisions made.4.2 ScenarioFigure 4.2 illustrates the MC02 scenario.  The Western Ranges represent the adversary‚Äôs territory and an imaginary peninsula creates a gulf.  The dispersion and size of the Western Ranges created a dispersed opponent in a large landmass.  This in turn assisted in the evaluation of the value of the ‚ÄúRapid Decisive Operations‚Äù concept.  MC02 participants fell into three categories (1) Simulation sites, (2) Live instrumented Range sites and (3) Live sites that were not instrumented.  The figure shows all of these. The Live Instrumented Western Ranges in MC02 were:Pt. MuguElectronic Combat Range - China LakeLand Range ‚Äì China LakeFt. Irwin (National Training Center)Nellis AFBSouthern California Offshore Range ‚Äì SCOREAdditional participants included individual ground troops instrumented at Southern California Logistics Area (SCLA formerly George AFB) as part of the Pt Mugu dataset. 5.  MC-02 Range IntegrationSeveral control, coordination, and analysis issues confront experiment providers managing combined live and simulated forces (or exercise providers, or evaluation providers for that matter).  Although a mix of simulated and live forces were used, all the experiment participants (or exercise ‚Äútraining audience‚Äù) were live.  Creating a coherent perception to the live participants by managing the live and simulated forces to stimulate these participants (and to respond to the participants‚Äô actions) while satisfying the experiment analysis and data collection needs is the goal of the experiment provider.  Simulated and live participants coordination had to be maintained. The experiment real-time coordination function was performed by the JECG, or ‚ÄúWhite Cell‚Äù.  The JECG was a group of senior staff that managed the real-time execution flow of the event to stimulate the participants‚Äô actions and ultimately achieve the goals of the experiment.  This JECG function to shape the exercise events had to be transparent to the participants while creating situations that required the participants to use systems and procedures under evaluation in the experiment.  In order to manage and shape the exercise event flow, the JECG needed insight into what the participants perceived as well as ‚Äúground truth‚Äù data from both the live activities and the simulations.  Ground truth is understood here to be the information created by simulations before ‚Äúfiltering‚Äù by any simulated sensors, etc. and presented to the participants.  Live ‚Äúground truth‚Äù is understood to be information from independent live range instrumentation.  Participant perceptions from live events are obtained from live operations sensors and data link communications.  The live, independent range instrumentation ‚Äúground truth‚Äù was used in conjunction with operational sensors (perceptions) to provide JECG observability into the actual live activities and the participants‚Äô operationally sensed and communicated perceptions.In MC02, the common view of both the live operational sensors and live independent range instrumentation was through Global Command and Control System (GCCS) workstations.  This common operational picture (COP) provided a high-level situation awareness view of the evolving experiment scenario in a common display format from data obtained from operational sensors (and data links) as well as from range instrumentation and the TENA object communications.JECG management and control functions (and any evaluation and analysis of ground truth versus perception data) were dependent on the correlation between the collections, communications and display of both the ground truth and perception data.  Evaluations had to consider aspects of this information from sample rates, communications and systems latencies, and the capabilities of any display and analysis systems that may affect a common JECG view of the exercise at any point in time.  An example of the display and analysis capabilities is that the display systems would ‚Äúhold‚Äù and display information received for some period and the local display refresh rates would indicate that a ‚Äúheld‚Äù object being displayed is at one position when that object has actually moved since the object‚Äôs data was received.  These systems characteristics can influence real-time exercise management decisions.6.  Range Integration ImplementationMC02 Range Integration activities were implemented by a set of interfaced and interoperable components.  The FI 2010 TENA prototype provided the middleware and the overall systems approach for Range Integration.  Existing range instrumentation systems sensed vehicles (and dismounted infantry in the case of the Marines) and provided this range sensor data to a range ‚ÄúGateway‚Äù in the range-systems‚Äô format.  At each range facility, a Range Gateway interfaced to the range instrumentation data (usually not directly to the sensor), translated the range data format to the TENA object model for MC02 and distributed the TENA stateful distributed objects (SDOs) [3] to the subscribing TENA applications.  For MC02, the subscribing TENA applications were other range systems Gateways and range display applications.  The range Gateway application hosted in the JECG at the Joint Training Analysis and Simulation Center (JTASC) was unique in that it provided the TENA object data to a GCCS interface for translation of TENA SDO attributes to operational Over The Horizon (OTH) message formats. The OTH messages were provided to the GCCS workstation via a serial interface.  In the MC02 event, a separate workstation received live operational sensor perceptions from various operational data links.  Additionally, both GCCS workstations received simulation-generated information translated to operational data link formats.  The JECG GCCS workstation concurrently displayed the live range ‚Äúground truth‚Äù information, the operational sensor information, and the translated simulation-based information.  The source (range, operational live sensor and M&S) was available for each GCCS ‚Äútrack‚Äù displayed so the JECG staff could discriminate the data source.  In order to provide the composite live ranges situation awareness common operational picture back to the range locations, one GCCS system distributed the COP back to Command and Control PC (C2PC) systems located at the ranges in the GCCS native format.  Additionally, the Range Integration network hosted a PC- based digital voice system supporting a range voice coordination network and a commercial format distribution of streaming video from any range location.  This combination of range ‚Äúground truth‚Äù TSPI, operational sensor data (live perceptions) and M&S data, provided the JECG a common operational picture of live and simulated objects.TENA is an object-oriented architecture.  A TENA Logical Range Execution (e.g. the MC02 Range Integration) includes an object model that is implemented and linked into the TENA applications with TENA middleware services and with user-developed application functions.  The TENA prototype used in MC02 provided the TENA stateful distributed objects (SDOs).  TENA message objects and TENA data stream objects are in development for later middleware releases.  SDOs are comprised of object attributes and methods.  The application ‚Äúowning‚Äù an SDO (server) implements ‚Äúservant‚Äù objects with the authority to set attribute values and determine updates - while all applications subscribing to a particular SDO (clients) implement a ‚Äúproxy‚Äù object for that SDO.  TENA provides data distribution from the server and SDO servants to the client applications and the SDO proxies.  Any TENA application may concurrently be a client and a server for multiple objects.  All TENA applications interacting in a Logical Range Execution were built with the same TENA object model.The FI 2010 project provided the TENA prototype middleware and technical support as well as assistance in MC02 integration testing.   NAWC-WD FI 2010 team members adapted the TSPI Internal Entity Reformatter (TIER) and Rangeview legacy applications.  The development schedule to build and test the MC02 logical range is shown in Figure 6.1.  Coordination between staff from JFCOM, FI 2010, and Naval Air Warfare Center ‚Äì Weapons Division (NAWC-WD) ranges (Point Mugu and China Lake) took place from February 2002 through spiral three testing in May 2002.  While the initial object model was developed in a couple of weeks, this object model was refined during the testing period.  Once the initial object model was defined, the TENA automatic code generation capability was used to implement source code stubs for the objects and then this source code was integrated with the legacy TIER and Rangeview applications by Point Mugu and China Lake staff respectively.  This ability to incorporate two different legacy software applications into interoperable TENA Logical Range applications fairly quickly is a very beneficial aspect of TENA.  Once a TENA object model is developed, applications re-using that object model ‚Äì and the source code produced for those objects --are inherently interoperable for those objects since the same source code is re-used by multiple applications (and different implementations of the basic objects‚Äô software is avoided).Figure 6.1 MC-02 Test Schedule 7. Foundation Initiative 2010 RolesDuring the time that the Range Integration team was proposing, planning and then finally implementing the Ranges‚Äô involvement in MC02, the FI 2010 project was in the midst of building the TENA middleware.  MC02 was therefore implemented and executed with releases of the TENA prototype middleware, known as ‚ÄúIKE 2‚Äù, to create the Range gateways.  The Range Integration team worked with IKE 2 major releases 1.0 and 2.0 and the 2.1 minor release.  The major releases came with a ‚Äúsample‚Äù object model.  The transition from one release to another was smoothed by support from the FI 2010 project team and the fact that several members of the Ranges Integration team had worked as part of the TENA Architecture Management Team (AMT), ultimately helping to set the course for TENA development. Direct FI project technical assistance came chiefly from the FI 2010 ‚ÄòCadre‚Äô.  The Cadre team is tasked specifically with providing such assistance to prospective users of FI 2010 products and with assessing and leveraging other initiatives to enhance and develop the FI 2010 product set.   Cadre members participated in Ranges Integration team meetings, planning processes, tests, object model development, efforts to create TENA compliant tools, etc.  Initial Cadre efforts were focused on helping identify requirements for Ranges services and products as well as identifying potential Range roles in this new area of Joint Experimentation.  Later, Cadre members provided assistance as requested with IKE 2 installations and testing. Much of the Cadre effort involved liaison and coordination between the Ranges Integration team, the TENA Developers, the TENA Tools team and the FI 2010 Object Model team.   This effort involved managemnt the coordination between the Ranges and the FI 2010 project teams, seeking priority for critical Ranges Integration team needs, flagging potential problem areas and applying the FI 2010 project team‚Äôs experience in software development and distributed exercises to the MC02 Ranges Integration implementation.8. Development and Testing During MC02 testing, a test plan was developed by Point Mugu range staff and executed during the various test spirals.  Initial testing was performed using the TENA sample object model (Figure 8-1) and applications distributed with the middleware.  This initial test was performed to verify that the TENA (and CORBA) networking would be adequate over the wide area network established for MC02 Range Integration.  Due to communications networks scheduling timelines, the initial tests, with the sample object model and applications were conducted over SIPRNET between Point Mugu and JFCOM/JTASC.  This test was followed shortly by the initial MC02 TENA gateway tests using the MC02 object model (Figure 8-2).  These later tests used the MC02 experiment communications over leased T1 circuits between the west coast facilities and the JTASC and the distributed voice over IP (VoIP) capability for coordination.9. Summary9.1 Using TENA to enable ranges‚Äô participationAs of the submission or this paper, the JFCOM Range Integration activities for joint experiment MC02 had implemented a TENA logical range, had adapted two separate legacy range applications as TENA Gateways, and had tested the TENA operations over SIPRNET and leased wide area communications.  In addition, the range integration team had interfaced five separate test and training ranges (Pt Mugu/Sea Range, China Lake Land Range, China Lake Electronic Combat Range, the National Training Center-Ft. Irwin, and Nellis Range), had demonstrated this logical range by distributing range TSPI data from live activities at these ranges, and had provided a common operational picture situation awareness including live range ground truth data to the JECG.Joint experimentation and training using combined live and simulation activities will continue within the DOD.  The benefits of the TENA object-oriented approach have been demonstrated and lessons learned for continued development of TENA.  The implementation of the TENA prototype used for MC-02, based on commercial Common Object Request Broker (CORBA) software and using a publish and subscribe data distribution approach has been shown to support the requirements for Joint Experimentation in MC02.  Lessons learned in MC-02 have provided needed insight into the development of TENA by the FI2010 project.  This insight into stateful distributed objects persistence, local and remote methods capabilities and the needs for TENA message objects and data stream objects have been shown.  The benefits of the TENA concept of providing object-oriented representations of scenario entities and the benefits of separate object representations of range infrastructure entities have been investigated.Figure 8-1.  IKE 2 Prototype Sample Object ModelFigure 8-2.  MC-02 range Integration TENA Object Model9.2 An initial effortMC02 was an initial effort by the Ranges and JFCOM to support Joint Experimentation. The goal for both the Range community and JFCOM was to enable full participation of the Ranges in Olympic Challenge 04 (OC04) with appropriate display, control and configuration tools.Staying on track for OC04 required that the Ranges show value-added for their participation in MC02.  While this assessment is still ongoing, it is clear that Range data TSPI reporting to the White Cell analysts is timely and of greater resolution than data from their usual tactical sources.  The present challenge will probably be how to meaningfully compare these sets of data based on the same source, but drawn from sensors and methods.9.3 Risks and rewardsThere was an element of risk taken on by each of the partners in the Ranges Integration effort of MC02.  For JFCOM, this was their first extensive use of live Ranges in Joint Experimentation.  Neither the value-added nor the achievability of Ranges participation could be guaranteed despite the importance of MC02.  For FI 2010, the team was in the process of developing the TENA middleware.  During MC02 preparations, there were two major and one minor release of prototypes of the middleware.  The Ranges involved had not attempted this level of coordination previously.  The resulting rewards, judging from early assessments, appear to have well justified the risk-taking:Data exchange has been smooth and trouble free using the IKE 2 (TENA Prototype) gateways even in early testing.‚ÄúSample‚Äù Object Models supplied with the middleware releases have performed satisfactorily. The Ranges Integration Team redesigned the sample object model to meet their needs quickly.  As would be expected, such tailoring appears (in early testing) to have substantially increased performance.  This tailoring to user needs is a desired process intended to evolve to a robust ‚Äústandard‚Äù object model while providing a useful product in the interim.NAWC-WD personnel without previous TENA experience were able to make a legacy China Lake display product, ‚Äú Rangeview‚Äù, TENA compliant within weeks and at a minimal cost.  This product was then distributed to and used to view/monitor the MC02 exercise at the other participating instrumented Ranges despite no previous familiarity with Rangeview.  This, like depending on usage to evolve standardized object models, is also part of the FI 2010 development strategy.  FI2010 does not intend to invest major efforts in developing software tools from ‚Äúscratch‚Äù, but rather to encourage TENA compliance for existing tools already in use.9.4 The way aheadMC02 was executed successfully with an early prototype of the TENA middleware and a very limited toolset.  It is expected that within the next year all the functionality of the final TENA middleware will be in place. For upcoming MC02-like events, useful additional functionality will include such features as:Remote method invocationData streamingMessagingMulticastIt is expected that the next major effort of the MC02 partners will likely be the ROVING SANDS 03 (RS03) training event presently scheduled for June 2003.  RS03 in itself will be but another milestone towards building the capability required for the Joint National Training Center, currently scheduled for IOC in 2004. The substantially increased maturity of the TENA middleware, the experience gained in using it by the Range community and the expected confidence in it by JFCOM is expected to make TENA a primary means for providing the needed training infrastructure interoperability and resource reuse for the JNTC.10.
