Medical Federation Object Model Study Group(MED FOM SG)Kick-Off Meeting Fall 2003 SIWChairWilliam Beavin (Boeing)Vice ChairRichard Severinghaus (Dynamic Animation Systems)Kenneth C. Curley (U.S. Army TATRC (MRMC-AT))SecretarySean Murphy (Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab)Objectives for this Workshop:Review the past, present and future of Medical M&S (e.g. why it is called “Medical Modeling and Simulation” (MM&S)….why is it so special?)Determine objectives of this group: Are we ready for FOM?Re-write Terms Of ReferenceElect officersComments and Recommendations:Rick Sharp, as Track Manager, reviewed history of Medical Track and formation of the Fall SIW Planning and Review Panel (Bill Beavin and Gerry Moses co-chaired). Noted that Medical is important both as an industry (size of market) and as a SISO group (this is a “test case” of starting an entirely new track with new study groups, etc).  Introduced Gene Wiehagen as our Technical Area Director.  Rick Severinghaus offered to assist the group with his considerable experience.  A repeated theme was that this is all so new to people and there are so few people from the medical realm participating, that concentrating on a FOM/BOM at this point might be premature.  Instead, consider this as the start of a medical track and build from there.  One goal will be to increase participation of MM&S community over next couple SIW’s. Harvey Magee and Ken Curley provided an excellent historical perspective of MM&S from the experience of the Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC).  It was suggested by several people at several points that TATRC should have the same kind of leadership role in medical M&S that DMSO has had in other areas of M&S within SISO.  The suggestion was basically TATRC should “drive the bus” regarding interactions with medical M&S industry and what could/should be standardized.  SISO could provide experience and framework within which standards can be developed.The group discussed the need to assess the MM&S community to determine what things have been standardized (e.g. HL-7 and SNOMED) and by whom, what groups are trying to standardize, what people feel needs to be standardized.  It was reiterated that SISO isn’t an “HLA organization” but a standards organization, and thus if another high-level standard is needed within MED, then the SISO organization is capable of helping with that.  The fact that standardization can be immensely expensive in money and time was discussed, and in this context long time SISO members stated that two of the valuable benefits of SISO participation is it, as an organization, already has a considerable wealth of experience and work on M&S standards, and, as a group of practitioners, much of SISOs work is, and has been, done by volunteers. Dr. Coolahan suggested that because MM&S is so broad, that we, as a Study Group, first consider vectors and standards for simulation for training and education (vs. straying off into biomolecular modeling for discovery research, etc) and defining existing object models. (e.g. what Sean Murphy has done)It was suggested that we change the Study Group name to “Medical Modeling and Simulation Interoperability Study Group” to better capture the intended focus of the group. The Terms Of Reference were briefly addressed.  The group leadership agreed to complete this via email/reflector discussion after the meeting. Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)10Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)15Peak attendance (including joint sessions)N/ATotal papers presented            N/A“No-show” presentationsNoneOther presentations and panel discussions1Recommended Reading List nominations (including previous nominations):	None.Contact List (as of Fall 03 SIW):NameOrganizationEmail/PhoneStudy Group PositionBill BeavinBoeing HYPERLINK "mailto:william.c.beavin@boeing.com" william.c.beavin@boeing.com ChairRick SeveringhausDynamic Animation Systems HYPERLINK "mailto:Rick.severinghaus@d-a-s.com" Rick.severinghaus@d-a-s.com (o) 757 412 4577(m) 757 348 4709Vice Chair/ MemberKen CurleyU.S. Army TATRC (MRMC-AT) HYPERLINK "mailto:curley@tatrc.org" curley@tatrc.org301-353-9240Vice Chair/ MemberSean MurphyJHU/APLsean.murphy@jhuapl.eduSecretaryHarvey MageeU.S. Army TATRC HYPERLINK "mailto:magee@tatrc.org" magee@tatrc.org301-619-4002TATRC repGerry MosesU.S. Army, TATRC HYPERLINK "mailto:moses@tatrc.org" moses@tatrc.org301-619-4000TATRC rep
