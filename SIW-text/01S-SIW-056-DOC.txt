The vision of FI 2010 is to enable interoperability among ranges, facilities, and simulations in a quick timely and cost-efficient manner and to foster reuse of range assets and future range system developments.   To achieve this vision, FI 2010 is developing and validating a common architecture, a core set of tools, inter-range communication capabilities, interfaces to existing range assets, interfaces to weapon systems, and recommended procedures for conducting synthetic test events or training exercises.  During FY 01, the project is developing the 2nd Test and Training ENabling Architecture (TENA) middleware Middleware prototype Prototype with expanded functionalities.   The FI 2010 will advance a simulation-based acquisition or a ‘distributed engineering plant’ methodology to streamline weapon system acquisition.  Benefits from the FI 2010 products include cost effective replacement of customized data links, enhanced exchange of mission data, organic TENA-compliant capabilities at test sites to be leveraged for future test events, and instrumentation system reuse.  Through FI 2010, future inter-range operations, instrumentation development and sustainment will cost less and incur less risk.  1. IntroductionOver the coming decades the global demands on the U.S. Military will be transformed by the continuing evolution of America’s security and economic interests coupled with the continuing revolution in information technologies.  Joint Vision 2020 (JV 2020), an evolutionary enhancement to the original Joint Vision 2010, provides a roadmap for, over the coming decades, the “creation of a force that is dominant across the full spectrum of military operations — —persuasive in peace, decisive in war, pre-eminent in any form of conflict.” [1]  As the demands on the military are being transformed by information technologies, so are its acquisition processes.  Simulation Based Acquisition (SBA) has the goal of substantially reducing the time, resources, and risk associated with the acquisition, process andwhile producing higher quality products through adoption of a “model-simulate-fix-test-iterate approach” to acquisition.While tThese transformations affect the entire military, they coalesce directly within the Test and Evaluation (T&E) community.  Test and training ranges must support implementation of the JV 2020 vision through joint testing, must serve as an enabler for SBA, must foster integration of testing and training, and must do so in a way that minimizes future costs of range operations.  To accomplish these goals, ranges must become more integrated and interoperable, allowing range assets to be procured and used efficiently, to be reused effectively and to be combined to create the scale and scope of capabilities required to meet the challenges of implementing JV 2020.  The Foundation Initiative 2010 (FI 2010) project is the range community’s mechanism for creating the infrastructure needed to meet these challenges.2. Project DescriptionThe vision of FI 2010 is to enable interoperability among ranges, facilities, and simulations in a quick and cost-efficient manner and to foster reuse of range assets and of future range system developmentss.    The FI 2010 solution will include a suite of products that will:enable affordable interoperability between test ranges and facilities as a means of sharing resources and data, thus enhancing the capabilities of the integrated test ranges and facilities, andprovide a common architecture that will enable improvements and modernization efforts made by one range to be used by all cooperating ranges.The FI 2010 project is developing and validating a common architecture, a core set of tools, inter-range communication capabilities, interfaces to existing range assets, and interfaces to weapon systems, along with recommended procedures for conducting synthetic test events or training exercises.2.1 Common architectureThe FI 2010 common architecture, referred to as the Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA), will be while compliant with the Department of Defense (DoD) High Level Architecture (HLA) for simulationsModeling and Simulation.  It , addresses test requirements beyond thosenot supported by HLA and drastically improves the ability of ranges to interact with simulations.  The FI 2010 project is coordinating with the Range Commanders Council so that TENA standards and protocols are reviewed and adopted by the range community.2.2 Core set of toolsThe FI 2010 core set ofTENA T tools is are a suite of key software applications to assist range engineers in planning, configuring, controlling, and analyzing synthetic and multiple range missions.  These TENA-compliant software  tools will enhance the productivity of the range engineer so that planning and reconfiguring for large-scale synthetic exercises can be accomplished much faster and with higher reliability.2.3 Inter-range communication The inter-range communication capabilities will validate that the products developed can function over both organic DoD wide-area networks and commercial communication services.  They will also evaluate use the necessary end equipment and encryption devices required for transferring large quantities of data between geographically dispersed locations in a TENA-compliant exercise. 2.4 Interfaces for existing range resources and tactical systemsThe FI 2010 project is developing interfaces the infrastructure necessary for existing range resources to become TENA-compliant.  The interfaces common infrastructure will cost-effectively enable current infrastructure range tools to be adapted to this common architecture, rather than require that replacement systems be developed.  Allowing weapon systems under test to be stimulated with a simulation, the FI 2010 project is also defining TENA interfaces for tactical systems, such as C4I systems.  2.5. Recommended proceduresThe FI 2010 project is documenting recommended procedures for test missions involving simulations or across multiple ranges as well as methods for making new instrumentation systems compliant with the common architecture.2.6 Development StrategyTo ensure that the common architecture satisfies the DoD ranges needs, TENA is being developed with significant involvement from the major DoD ranges.  Development Test Cells (DTCs) have been established at the ranges to provide early insight to TENA performance so that the ranges can, in turn, give essential, detailed feedback on operational issues.  Furthermore, system engineers from across the range community participate in the Common Test and Training Range Architecture (CTTRA) workshops to impart recommendations to the TENA development and specification.  TENA is being defined and developed in three major prototype developments.The baseline TENA architecture was refined, and the HLA/TENA initial comparison was completed, through a series of three successful exercises in FY 98.  During FYs 99 and 00, the project developed and tested the 1st First TENA Middleware pPrototype, which both updated and validated a subset of the TENA Technical Reference Architecture.  This software prototype was tested at six test ranges across the three Services and is scheduled to be deployed at both a test range and a training range.    During FY 01, the FI 2010 project will beis developing the TENA 2nd Second middleware Middleware prototype Prototype (codenamed IKE 2) with expanded functionalities.  The development contractor for IKE 2 is SAIC Distributed Computing Technology DivisionScience Applications International Corporation, located in Alexandria, VA.  Using a rapid prototyping approach, the TENA development spirals of IKE 2 will allow test engineers at DoD ranges and facilities  to quickly evaluate and refine the common architecture.  In addition to the 2nd second prototype, the FI 2010 project will be reviewing several commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software applications to serve as FI 2010 tools.  The project is on track and scheduled for Full Operational Capability (FOC) by the fourth quarter of 2004, with the ultimate goal to have TENA adopted as a Range Commanders Council (RCC) standard..3. FI 2010 and TENA ObjectivesFI 2010 is chartered with creating the technological infrastructure to implement logical ranges: integrated environments that combine test ranges and facilities, training ranges, laboratories, and modeling and simulation (M&S) assets to improve the scope, scale, and effectiveness of testing and training in a cost-effective manner.  The logical range concept extends across the full lifecycle of exercises and events.  FI 2010 will support event planning through provision of collaboration tools and reuse repositories that aid range personnel in working together to plan and assemble complex test events or training exercises.  It will support event execution by interconnecting assets within and across facilities to create a seamless virtual environment.  Finally, FI 2010 will support post-event data analysis by providing distributed access to event data.The mechanism for this integration is TENA, the FI 2010 architecture.  TENA will support interoperability between the live testing/training range domain and the larger M&S community.   TENA includes several components: a domain-specific object model that supports data and remote object control across exercise/event lifecycles, a common set of services for manipulating objects, as well as other standards, protocols, rules, and supporting software.  4. IKE 2 Technical ObjectivesThe essential problem addressed by the creation of the TENA second middleware prototype, or IKE 2, is interoperability between and among range information processing systems leading to tighter integration, more software reuse, increased connectivity, and a better ability to create larger, more realistic, and functional logical ranges.  The IKE 2 infrastructure will facilitate interoperability throughout all phases of a test or training event, including planning and the allocation of resources, event rehearsal, event execution, and post-event analysis.  The infrastructure will facilitate reuse through composable or modular solutions to range problems, and will do this primarily by providing a standards-based Application Program Interface (API) for range software development based on existing COTS and DoD standards, such as the HLA.  The infrastructure will also allow for integration with a repository containing reusable software, data, and components that can be easily put together to perform new missions for the ranges.The IKE 2 middleware will support pre- and post-exercise requirements through the use of the Interactive Data Language (IDL) as a common object definition language,  through full integration of dynamic and persistent data, and through a combination of push and pull-based data distribution mechanisms which are applicable across run-time, management, planning, and analysis applications.  The approach will support event execution via a high-performance real-time data distribution system derived from the Common Object Reference Broker Architecture (CORBA)-based HLA Run Time Infrastructure – Next Generation (RTI-NG) software.  The IKE 2 approach facilitates legacy integration through inclusion of “Data Interfaces” (DIs) that bridge TENA and legacy protocols.5. IKE 2 Technical ApproachThe IKE 2 architecture approachwill be is a blueprint for the next generation of TENA infrastructure design and development.  The architecture IKE 2 design will draw heavily on object technology, employing object-oriented frameworks to provide flexibility, extensibility, and modularity to allow TENA developers to tailor the infrastructure to meet their particular needs. 5.1 System design philosophyThe IKE 2 software architecture will be capable of adapting and evolving to meet the increasingly diverse and demanding needs of the range community.  It will support multiple programming languages and configurations, with some IKE 2 modules being tailored to meet a specific range event’s particular requirements.  The TENA vision mandates that the IKE 2 prototype infrastructure be designed to embrace change, promote flexibility, and manage complexity so that the range community can work together to build interoperable and reusable systems in as efficient and cost-effective a fashion as possible.  The goal is for the IKE 2 design to be robust enough for the most demanding applications and general purpose enough to meet the requirements of future range event configurations.The use of object-oriented frameworks provides the technical capability to create an infrastructure that is both generic (applicable to any event) and tailorable (customizable to meet the special needs of any particular event) within a single software architecture and using the same interfaces.  An object-oriented framework is a set of classes, designed to work together, that embodies an abstract design for solutions to a family of related problems.  In the case of IKE 2, the family of related problems is the interoperability, reuse, and object distribution problems addressed by TENA.  Developers specialize framework classes to solve a specific problem.  Frameworks add structure to these problem solutions and it is this structure that enhances interoperability.  To see how frameworks help solve TENA-related problems, consider the three kinds of developers in a TENA context:Range Resource Developers: the developers throughout the range community who build new applications and interfaces to legacy systems that are resident at ranges.  Examples of Range Resources include display systems, data processors, sensors (radars, telemetry, optics, hydrophones, etc.), stimulators, and range control systems.  They are primarily concerned with the algorithmic correctness and functionality of their applications and not with the details of the distributed  federationsystem, ; however, they are concerned with interoperability between their applications and the rest of the logical range.  Application developers will use the TENA/IKE 2 API.Range System Integrators (a.k.a, Logical Range Builders): the developers who develop the common data definitions (the Object Model), interest management statements, and the data interfaces needed for a given event.  They will customize and tune the performance and behavior of the IKE 2 software to meet an event’s requirements.TENA Middleware Developers: the developers who actually build the IKE 2 software and frameworks and create the underlying mechanisms for implementing the TENA functional capabilities.The basic approach to creating IKE 2 is to create an architecture design that is general enough to meet the needs of the range community, interoperable enough to present a consistent API to all range systems, and flexible enough to adapt to distinct needs of a given test mission.  The architecture will be demonstrated through a modular, flexible IKE 2 prototype that will be extensible over time to meet the needs of the entire range community.  Reuse comes in two different flavors.  Design reuse means that the detailed design that is created will lead to inherently reusable software.  This type of reusability will be achieved by the inherent flexibility of the framework- and standards-based architecture.  With this type of reuse, the prototype can adapt to changing requirements and lead the way towards a commercial TENA middleware.  The second flavor of reuse is reuse of existing designs and software.  The architecture (described below) already adapts and reuses a number of features present in the current HLA RTI-NG 1.3 implementation.  Reusing a substantial amount of design work from the RTI along with a large amount of open-source COTS software used by the RTI-NG 1.3 is envisioned for the development of IKE 2.  This existing software has already been built using a framework-based architecture.  Designs, interfaces, and algorithms from the IKE 1 prototype will also be reused, where appropriate.  5.2 Critical architectural elements The approach to designing and building the IKE 2 prototype is based on a number of key architectural  elements, assumptions, and technologies.  This section discusses these elements.  5.2.1 Object model interaction mechanisms.  There are a number of object communication modes that need to be supported by TENA (and the IKE 2 prototype) and incorporated into the TENA object model.  Each communication mechanism is important for a given aspect or time frame in an event’s history.  The primary modes are:Meta-Object Protocol (MOP).  The meta-object protocol is used by applications to gain information about an object when it needs to understand how an object is constructed.  The MOP allows for the retrieval of information about the object’s methods and attributes, and information about how objects are linked to each other (i.e., their relationships).  The MOP can be used by object repositories, object browsers, compilers, development environments, etc., to make understanding and using a class or an object easier for the various types of developers.  The TENA MOP would be used by range system integrators to understand the capabilities of the software and TENA objects resident in the repository.Location Transparent Object Proxies.  This access mechanism allows an object’s methods to be accessed independently from where the actual object resides.  The calling object manipulates a proxy object that “stands in” for the accessed or target object.  The target object may exist in the same process space as the caller, in a different process space, or on a different machine.  When the caller invokes a method on the proxy, the proxy invokes the method on the target object (wherever it is) and pulls any return information from the target and delivers it to the caller.  For example, in the range community, a proxy object may exist for a given radar system and its methods might represent commands to be sent to the radar.  Another use may be for accessing information infrequently about an object that changes very frequently.  In such a case, a pull-based mechanism is more efficient than a push-based mechanism (discussed below).  The primary example of a location-transparent object proxy is the standard CORBA Object Request Broker (ORB) mechanism..Event Channel/Run-Time Messaging.  This access mechanism also uses proxies to stand in for remote objects but in this case the target object sends messages to its proxies telling them of its changes in state.  This mechanism is considered a push-based mechanism since the target objects push their information out to any other applications that have expressed interest in them.  Data delivery using this mechanism is usually through an event channel that delivers messages to those applications subscribed to that channel.  An example of this mechanism is the CORBA Event Service.Persistence / Store -and and-Forward Messaging..  This access mechanism stores objects or their state in a persistent store, such as a database, to be retrieved at a later time by applications that need it.  This mechanism incorporates the strengths of commercial databases (such as transactions, robustness, persistence) while sacrificing the low latency of the previous two mechanisms.  Sometimes, a persistent store is used to create a reliable messaging service in which the messages are stored in the database and forwarded to the appropriate application when it comes on on-line.  Extremely scalable and robust, but proprietary, messaging services such as Oracle Advanced Messaging and The Information Bus by TIBCO  have been created over the years using this paradigm.  NonSome non-proprietary mechanisms based on the CORBA Asynchronous Messaging Service are beginning to appear in the marketplace.5.2.2 Pre-compiled object model.   Because frameworks are both generic and tailorable, it becomes possible to incorporate the object model into an application without losing generality or flexibility.  An object model that is pre-compiled and initialized with the application yields many benefits, including increased efficiency, the ability to support strong type checking, and the ability to efficiently handle complex object relationships.  In the opposite case of loose coupling between the object model and the software, the application needs to interpret the object’s methods and attributes at run-time, causing significant performance penalties.  Similarly, run-time typing of the object model can lead to difficult-to-find defects in the application, since both type and value information are supplied by the range system integrator and are not checked for consistency by the compiler.  Such errors can manifest themselves in subtle, intermittent, and insidious ways (such as stack corruption) that can only be tracked down with extremely time-consuming troubleshootingare hard to track down.  Modern software engineering practices and procedures mandate the use of strongly-typed languages (such as C++ or Java)  primarily to avoid the maintenance problems associated with run-time data typing.A mechanism is needed to enable a range system integrator to create a compilable object model without impacting IKE’s generality.  The IKE 2 solution to this problem is through the use of the CORBA IDL Interface Definition Language (IDL) or one of its variants.  An IDL compiler will compile the object model into programming language code such as C++ or Java.  The compiler would auto-code-generate (ACG) the software necessary for the object model information to be attached to the framework in a clean and seamless fashion.  The IDL was chosen as the definition language because: 1) it is fully object-oriented and is thus completely compatible with the framework design, 2) it is programming-language independent, 3) a number of free, yet fully-supported, IDL compilers exist, and 4) it is a standard that is fully compatible with COTS the CORBA-based infrastructure already developeds.5.2.3 Full event life cycle support.  Any test event or training exercise is the result of a long planning, setup, and rehearsal process.  The actual test event itself, when it occurs, may represent a small fraction of the effort and time devoted to the entire event process.  Despite this fact, almost all effort with respect to interoperability and reuse in the DoD has been focused on applications that exist during the small amount of time that an event actually takes place, while ignoring or downplaying the opportunities for enhancing the interoperability and reuse of applications used before or after an event execution.  This focus on event-execution-related applications is a lost opportunity to build an architecture and infrastructure that truly enhances interoperability and reuse throughout all of the range community’s broad efforts.  Thus, TENA (and the implementation of the IKE 2 prototype) includes mechanisms for managing information (i.e., objects) before, during, and after a given event.The IKE 2 prototype will incorporate mechanisms for managing both persistent data during and outside of run-time, as well as message and proxy-oriented information during run-time.  The IKE 2 API will try to present the range resource developers with as consistent and unified an API as possible with respect to manipulating objects throughout an event life cycle. Since there are a number of significant differences between the nature of run-time information and, for instance, planning information, it may be necessary to design the object model in such a way as to differentiate between an object’s run-time aspect and its persistent aspect.  Thus, though the IKE 2 API will have interfaces to deal with managing objects through the full event life cycle, it is incumbent on the range system integrators to create an object model that will take full advantage of the capabilities of all of the possible communication mechanisms.  In this way, IKE 2 will be pre-positioned to help the range community manage the large amount of data required to successfully plan, execute, manage, and analyze an event.5.2.4 Data Iinterfaces.  TENA must have a mechanism to incorporate legacy ranges systems to leverage the existing DoD test and training infrastructure.  Moreover, TENA must be able to interface to weapon systems to properly inject (or stimulate) and extract (or collect) data from the weapon systems.  Modular, specialized data interfaces allow range system integrators to build Logical Ranges with existing range resources and, more importantly, incorporate weapon systems into a Logical Range construct.  There is nothing inherent in the IKE 2 design to preclude the use of multiple protocols, or multiple DI’s in a single implementation of IKE 2.  In this way, a protocol translator can be created in which certain protocols can be read and interpreted using one DI, then republished using a second DI.5.2.5 Repeatability.  The essence of repeatability for any given test or training exercise is whether individual tests comprising the larger event can be played back in the same order multiple times.  Examples of this include replay of range data to evaluate different algorithms in a hardware-in-the-loop system or injection of previously collected range data into a test.  To achieve this, a data distribution scheme that allows ordering of events is required.  The HLA RTI-NG 1.3 uses a number of techniques to preserve event ordering within a federation; these techniques will be adapted to provide IKE 2 the capability to produce synchronized, repeatable experiments.  It is important to recognize that only events that require repeatability should incur any additional performance cost with respect to event ordering.5.2.6 Performance.  The minimization of latency is critical for certain test events.  There are a number of things that can be done to create an IKE 2 prototype that will minimize latency caused by delivering data to, and receiving data from, the network.  Incorporating the object model at initialization will yield significant gains, since the data that needs to be sent over the wire can be packaged very efficiently using pre-compiled code rather than code that needs to interpret each attribute before sending.  In addition, a great deal of efficiency is gained using intelligent memory management that minimizes data copying and context switching.  The real time ORB TAO (The ACE ORB), used as the basis of the RTI-NG 1.3’s data distribution infrastructure,  is designed to implement many of these efficiencies.   The TAO will be used as the underlying communication infrastructure for the IKE 2 prototype.  IKE 2 will and thus gain all of the advantages of using this powerful open-source real-time ORB.5.2.7 Scalability.  A Logical Range’s scalability may be broadly defined as how the computing and communication overhead increases as more range systems are integrated in the particular Logical Range.  In other words, as each extra computer is added to support a given test mission, how much of that computer’s processing power is devoted to application processing, and how much is devoted to overhead (such as communication)?  In non-scalable systems, there is a size at which additional processing power will yield no extra processing capability, as all additional processing power is being used for overhead functions.  A goal of the IKE 2 development effort is to enable the creation of scalable configurations, whose size can grow without limit, or at least grow large enough to handle the expected size of the largest planned test event or training exercise.Scalability is a function of two things — the intrinsic scalability of the system configuration, and the infrastructure’s efficiency in transporting, delivering, and managing the minimum amount of data necessary to support the event.  The first aspect of scalability (intrinsic scalability) is not under the control of the TENA middleware developers.  If range system integrators create a configuration using a scenario in which all objects need information about all other objects, then as the number of objects increases, the overhead required to manage data delivery will increase until a maximum size is reached.  More realistic scenarios tend to have a much looser coupling between the objects used by the applications, leading to the possibility of being able to achieve scalability through the use of interest management or filtering (i.e., data delivery based on well-defined and declared application requirements).  If application data requirements are constant as the size of the configuration grows, the scenario is intrinsically scalable, and all that remains is the construction of a software mechanism to limit data delivery to the minimum required by the application.5.2.8 Security.  Security is important in TENA since only certain authenticated users and applications will have the right to interact with certain objects.  The CORBA Security Service, defined in the CORBA Services specification and implemented within the TAO ORB will be evaluated as the distributed object security mechanism used by TENA.  Since physical security for the computers and networks will be maintained based on DISA standards (e.g., separate networks, bulk and/or packet/cell encryption devices), the CORBA Security Service will provide additional object-based security within a trusted enclave.  Thus a layered approach, starting with physical security and network security, then adding object security on top, will ensure that the final systems and configurations meet the needs of a given user community with respect to security.  Additional security features are being considered based on the detailed requirements analysis and design work during the initial iteration of the IKE 2 development.5.2.9 CORBA services.  The TAO ORB implements a number of the important CORBA Services that are required for TENA, including the Event, Asynchronous Messaging, Notification, Lifecycle, Logging, Naming, A/V Streaming, Notification, Security (portions), Time, and Trading Services.  Additional services required by TENA and not provided by TAO are being developed in conjunction with the TAO developers as additional TAO services.  Currently, the only service that TAO does not implement that may be required for TENA is the Transaction Service.5.3 Strawman ArchitectureA high-level view of the IKE 2 architecture is shown in Figure  5.1.  Each box represents a framework or an implementation derived from the framework that defines a broad category of internal IKE functionality.  In each case, the framework may be specialized to provide new functionality.  Only major relationships between the different subcomponents are shown to keep the diagram as simple as possible.  During the detailed design portion of the IKE 2 development, a complete architecture and design is will be being produced and documented in Unified Modeling Language (UML) including all of the anticipated classes and subclasses, their relationships, interfaces, and encapsulated state, as well as detailed event-trace diagrams showing the interactions of each class with other classes based on use-case analyses.  A brief description of each component follows. Figure 1 — Layered Architectural view of the IKE 2 framework with implementations.  In this view, each aspect of the IKE 2 implementation is specialized from a framework.  (The triangles indicate inheritance going up in this conceptual diagram).  The API itself is just a union of the interfaces presented by the various implementations below it.  The light gray boxes are COTS software.  The dark gray boxes represent those parts of the IKE 2 implementation that are auto-code-generated from the object model IDL representation.  The black box represents DI software created by the ranges to incorporate legacy systems.5.3.1 ADAPTIVE Communication Environment (ACE).  ACE is a freely available, open-source object-oriented framework that implements many core design patterns for concurrent communications.  ACE provides a rich set of reusable C++ wrapper facades and framework components that perform common communication software tasks across a range of computer platforms.  The communication software tasks provided by ACE include event demultiplexing and event handler dispatching, signal handling, service initialization, inter-process communication, shared memory management, message routing, dynamic (re)configuration of distributed services, concurrent execution and synchronization.5.3.2 The ACE ORB (TAO).  TAO is a freely available, open-source, and standards-compliant real-time implementation of CORBA (including many CORBA Services) that provides efficient, predictable, and scalable quality of service (QoS) end-to-end.Figure 5.1 — Layered Architectural view of the IKE 2 framework with implementations.  In this view, each aspect of the IKE 2 implementation is specialized from a framework.  (The triangles indicate inheritance going up in this conceptual diagram).  The API itself is just a union of the interfaces presented by the various implementations below it.  The light gray boxes are COTS software.  The dark gray boxes represent those parts of the IKE 2 implementation that are auto-code-generated from the object model IDL representation.  The black box represents DI software created by the ranges.5.3.3 Data Interface (DI) Fframework.  The DI framework provides the base classes necessary to develop unique data interfaces to existing systems.  In reality, this framework is built in to the TAO ORB core, which allows for custom protocols and interceptors to be plugged into the ORB without affecting the standard CORBA programming model.  In this current prototyping phase, FI 2010 is developing a CORBA DI, a HLA DI, and a DI to a database system.  TENA middleware developersrange integrators can specialize and extend the DI framework to create different protocols for specific  legacylegacy range systems and weapons systems, such as a tactical data link.5.3.4 Object framework.  This framework provides the base classes necessary to implement the TENA object services.  It provides the relationship services, introspection, method operations and other object services defined in the TENA functional capabilities document.5.3.5 Distributed Interest-Based Message Exchange (DIME)IME.  DIME is the interest management framework that provides for the declaration of interests and the delivery of only that information to subscribers that they actually wish to receive.  DIME also implements the change notification capability defined in the TENA functional capabilities document.5.3.6 TENA objects.  These are the actual objects defined by the TENA object model in IDL and auto-code-generated by the IDL compiler for implementation in the IKE 2 system.  Actual skeleton implementations of object methods associated with a given object will not be code-generated and are the responsibility of the range system integrators.5.3.7 Interests.  The interests are related to a given object model and specify the predicates necessary for deciding whether a given piece of information is desired or not.  These interests are defined in the IDL and are auto-code-generated by the IDL compiler.5.3.8 Authenticator.  This object component implements the CORBA security function and mediates object access based on whether a given application is trusted to use a given object.  In principle, this authenticator may be the CORBA Security Service implemented by TAO, depending on a more thorough requirements analysis and design.5.3.9 Event scheduler.  This object component determines the order of event (or task) execution within the IKE 2 framework, and implements various event-ordering schemes so that repeatability can be achieved in an IKE 2 application.  This subcomponent might be a specialization of the TAO CORBA Scheduling Service, depending on a more thorough requirements analysis and design.5.3.10 IKE 2 API.  The IKE 2 API is a simplified the union of the APIs defined by the frameworks and their derived objects that sit below the interface.  Thus, part of the interface is defined by the TENA object definition in IDL, while other parts of the interfaces are more static in nature.5.4 Object model developmentThe TENA Object Model, complete with a meta-model, unified schema, and guidance for facilitating technical integration, represents the most promising approach to large-scale architecture-based development within the heterogeneous range community.  The common meta-object model and schema promote the interoperability essential to TENA’s success.  The single most important advance for the range community in creating systems that are interoperable and reusable is to create a Common Object Model.  Note that a full Meta-Model and Object Model need not – in fact cannot – be achieved a priori.  Nor can it remain static over the lifetime of TENA.  Its incremental emergence, and its continual evolution, is part of the anticipated TENA architecture maturation process.The essential advance in creating a Common Object Model is the definition of standard, reusable interfaces to different types of information.  These standard interfaces, and the standard data types behind them, are the principal mechanism for achieving and sustaining interoperability and reuse.  The interfaces should ideally be defined in a technology-neutral fashion, and then be mapped (or compiled) into any specific technology.  A common meta-model, defined across the entire range domain, has already been defined by the TENA community.It is impractical to ask that the entire range community agree on a single unified object model right away.  The degree to which any set of systems need to interoperate defines the level of specificity of their shared object model.  It is unnecessary for a comprehensive global object model to be shared throughout the range community, merely that the model being specialized for a specific sub-domain adheres to the model of its super-class.  Thus, there can be levels of interoperability — from systems that use a common database, to loosely interoperable message-based systems, to tightly integrated applications using the same technical component frameworks.  Each integration strategy has underlying technical features that form the basis for interoperability choices.  Interoperability is thus a matter of degree – the degree required for any given test event or training exercise.ConclusionFuture warfighting concepts, relying heavily on network network-centric warfare capabilities, cannot be adequately tested with today’s test infrastructure.  A new, interoperable foundation must be established.  The nation cannot afford to rebuild the entire infrastructure, so a strategy must be instituted to ensure that needed legacy capabilities are adapted, and future investments are designed to be interoperable in support of these future warfighting scenarios.  The FI 2010 project, with its IKE 2 prototype, is a clear step toward developing this strategy by investigating, developing and coordinating the standards and procedures needed to achieve interoperability.  Range asset owners and acquisition program managers are the key to successful implementation, and the FI 2010 team is heavily involved in coordinating their activities among all potential stakeholders to ensure success..  7.0 Reference[1]	Joint Vision 2020, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC, June 2000 Author BiographiesGEORGE RUMFORD is the Technical Project Manager for FI 2010.
