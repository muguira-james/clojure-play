The authors of 04S-SIW-114 rewrote small sections of their paper to ease the concerns of the cited author and the paper was re-accepted as a recommended paper.  It is the feelings of the PRP that this paper is most certainly recommended reading.SNE and SENS have begun the task of dissolving SENS.The most popular presentations were on Ultra-High Resolution terrain databases.  This seems to indicate that there is growing (continuing?) interesting in the work being done on the greater fidelity databases.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)32Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)47Peak attendance (including joint sessions)NATotal papers presented13“No-show” presentations0Other presentations and panel discussions0Recommended Reading List nominations (including previous nominations):04S-SIW-11404S-SIW-007
