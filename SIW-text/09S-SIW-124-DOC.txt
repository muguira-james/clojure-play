Provide a forum for the Technical Community to present potential solutions to Users.Comments and Recommendations:The TRAIN forum held four sessions, each of which are described in subsequent paragraphs:Modeling and Simulation Training ResearchTraining Simulation Software Development IssuesCrisis Management TrainingModeling and Simulation Training ApplicationsModeling and Simulation Training Research:  The first TRAIN Forum session hosted three papers that focused on current research being accomplished in the field of simulation- or simulator-assisted training.  In the first presentation, "Immersive Dynamic Planning Team Training Using Modeling and Simulation " (09S-SIW-023), the Air Force Research Lab in Mesa, AZ conducted an Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) training research exercise looking into the training received by the dynamic planning team.  This exercise was one in a series of exercises that have been conducted to explore different aspect of AOC training as well as test and de-risk new software loads for the AOC.  Team training in an AOC is very complex and the team at Mesa explored ways to prepare the dynamic planning team for asymmetrical warfare and other new skills they would need to employ in the current Area of Operations.  Next was “Applying Case Based Reasoning Techniques to Reduce Modeling Costs in OneSAF” (09S-SIW-068) which described a tool for searching behaviors for ones with desired traits, then retrieving and analyzing them.  A paper entitled “Presence-Dependent Performance Differences Between Virtual Simulations and Miniature Worlds’ (09S-SIW-016) presented the results of a study that measured the effects of presence on performance.  The last presentation within this session was “Experiences with an Integrated Live Airborne Federate Within a Distributed Mission Simulation” (09S-SIW-081) that described a project in which a simulation was used to stimulate a pilot in a live aircraft.  Rockwell Collins is currently experimenting with live L-29 Delphin to make them LVC compliant.  They have been working with the Operator Performance Lab at the University of Iowa to make aircraft dual use for actual mission and for simulated missions.  An example they used is an pilot on a transatlantic flight can actually turn their aircraft into a simulator and rehearse the mission they are preparing to conduct.  They’ve adapted the brown out displays used by helicopters as the display.  They are looking to conduct studies that test a pilot’s ability to mentally switch between a simulated mission and their real mission.  The long term goal of this effort is for the aircraft software to support both live and simulated environments.Training Simulation Software Development Issues.  The “Distributed Debrief Control under the Navy Aviation Simulation Master Plan (NASMP)” (09S-SIW-071) presentation started this session.  The Navy showcased their debrief system build using commercial and government off-the-shelf technologies to conduct distributed debriefs.  The control approach they’ve chosen is peer-to-peer since the military is structured by rank which would compliment this open approach.  The exercises use the Sandia Labs’ HLA logger to capture the data for replay and use the same controls to extend to the debrief.  The files are all time stamped using GPS and allow for the placement of bookmarks for reference during the debrief.  The Navy has also integrated Flight Viz as part of their debrief suite of tools and have developed an interface through Sim Author to use the tools.  In the next presentation, “Simulation of Improvised Explosive Devices” (09S-SIW-036), SAIC described IED parameters they had defined that would be useful for IED-related training.  Ending this session was a presentation entitled “Multi Level Security in Combined Mission Simulation Architectures” (09S-SIW-035).  Col Verkoelen presented a security concept to address the complexity of multiple organizations needing to share information.Crisis Management Training.  This session began with a paper entitled “Design of a Bioterrorism Crisis Management Simulation for Preparedness and Response” (09S-SIW-065) which presented the details of a simulation developed as part of the National Center for the Study of Preparedness and Catastrophic Event Response.  Paper 09S-SIW-057, “Design of a Model for Stability and Reconstruction Policy Evaluation for Underdeveloped Urban Economics”, described a tool that models the economic actors and activity of an urban area in a crisis state.  The presentation for the last paper, 09S-SIW-014 “Interoperability in the Next Generation Training Systems” had not been received by the beginning of the session and the author could not be located so this paper was cancelled.Modeling and Simulation Training Applications.  “Modeling and Simulation for Information Operations” (09S-SIW-054) was presented first within this session.  It described an approach to Information Operation planning, including a description of an HLA-based simulation.  In the “APLET’s Course of Action Modeling and C4I Interfaces Evolution” (09S-SIW-072) presentation, the author provided an update on APLET-SICF interoperability.  The final paper was “Distribute Warfare Center: Increase/Enhance/Augment Combat Readiness” (09S-SIW-084).  The Distributed Mission Operations Center (DMOC) has branched off a separate team called the Distributed Warfare Center (DWC).  The DWC is aligned under the 505th at Hurlburt AFB, Florida but will also support the 705th at Kirtland AFB, New Mexico.  The mission of the DWC will be to focus on small scale, tailorable training events.  These smaller scale events will be titled Warfighter Focus Events (WFE) and will use Mission Essential Competencies (MECs) to develop scenarios that will be provided through a knowledge management system to combat units for training at their local Mission Training Centers (MTCs).  One of their goals is to create an LVC WFE through working with the Joint Terminal Attack Controller Dome at the Air Force Research Lab in Mesa, Arizona and the Training Wing at Nellis AFB, Nevada.  Another of their goals is to acquire a VSTARS training capability to work with the Nellis Weapons School.  The DWC is also looking to assist units with Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) interoperability testing.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)21Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)31Peak attendance (joint sessions)50Total papers presented12“No-show” presentations1Other presentations and panel discussions0Recommended Reading List nomination: 09S-SIW-057: Design of a Model for Stability and Reconstruction Policy Evaluation for Underdeveloped Urban Economics09S-SIW-036: Simulation of Improvised Explosive Devices                 2009 SPRING SIW OUTBRIEF FORM
