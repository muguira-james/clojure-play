Joint sessions held with ANL, SMS COMPOSE, SNE/SENS this time.SISO-STD-002 for Link 16 has been proven in recent Air Force exercises, and there is a need for a general set of templates for all tactical data links following the SISO-STD-002 example.Geometric pairing models bring in additional sources of error which need to be properly accounted for to insure accurate combat resolution results.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)20Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)23Peak attendance (including joint sessions)23Total papers presented11“No-show” presentations1Other presentations and panel discussions0Recommended Reading List nomination: 07S-SIW-042                 2007 SPRING SIW OUTBRIEF FORM
