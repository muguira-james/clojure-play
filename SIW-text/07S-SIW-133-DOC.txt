Emails to US government military log doctrine and policy organizations yielded no response, so this strategy was not successful. Comments and Recommendations:Interest in LOG was moderate, measured by abstracts received, but low based on actual papers submitted.. Of 9 abstracts directed to LOG only two papers were developed. Only one of these, 07S-SIW-069, was presented, the other, 064, being an author and presentation non-show. LOG PRP members, the Chair included, are finding it increasingly difficult to get sponsorship to attend SIW, with two of the three current PRP members no longer working logistics issues in their professional portfolios. For these reasons these LOG PRP members will likely not run for next year’s PRP. Unless new leadership steps up we recommend SISO stand down LOG, and direct future SIW logistics M&S papers to other forums, such as VWS for logistics vehicles and transportation topics, Analysis for logistics operational and process analysis topics, and SAPD for logistics R&D as well as manufacturing simulation.LOG PRP intends to support Fall 2007 SIW to the full extent we can, although getting to that SIW may prove a challenge. If LOG papers for Fall are few in number and especially if they are directed to, or appropriate for, other forums, LOG may follow a policy of directing all LOG papers to those other forums, and not having a distinct Fall LOG session. If we do that then we can either provide a LOG agenda sheet directing those interested in LOG to those presentations, or we can skip a fall LOG session entirely. However, if strong interest in LOG is present, based on a large number of abstracts and papers, LOG will work to provide a final LOG session at Fall 2007 SIW. The CC should make their preference known to the LOG Chair to ensure preferred outcomes are achieved. Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)6Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)7Peak attendance (including joint sessions)n/a – no JointTotal papers presented1“No-show” presentations1Other presentations and panel discussions0Recommended Reading List nomination: none                 2007 SPRING SIW OUTBRIEF FORM
