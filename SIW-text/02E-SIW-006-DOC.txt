Workstations simulate friendly and opposing virtual entities operating widely autonomously. Tasks and orders are given by an instructor.A new kernel for such simulator systems is under development. It is to be a framework used both for gunnery and tactical simulation and for further applications. Coupling of combat simulator systems and command and control information systems shall be realizable. Also live simulation could be integrated, enabling the warfighters to train as they fight. Operational staff at each level of command would be able to analyze combat situations with their original equipment, to take decisions and to give orders to manned and/or simulated units. The military decision process will be more and more supported by simulation. Therefore using a standard data model for the mapping of the combat flows is reasonable.The new kernel is designed to make the creation of complex simulation systems much simpler. The latest object-oriented design and coding techniques are applied. The use of HLA and CORBA is planned for communication. Product range overlapping synergies shall be utilized by using both architectures.1. IntroductionActual and future requirements and decreasing or stagnating budgets leads to a harmonization of the simulation system community and the C2I (command, control and information) system community. Each of them developed their own solutions in the past but a harmonization will reduce multiple efforts and makes a reuse of components significantly easier. Independent of this interoperability between simulation systems and C2I systems will be more and more important in the future. Coupling both will be a demanded application for training exercises and operation support [19]. The possibility to train the warfighters as they fight could be achieved and analyzing  and decision processes could be supported. A further item would be the possibilities of simulation-based acquisition.Considering in particular the land-based combat simulation system community one deals with ground warfare simulator environments with multiple components like manned cabins, tactical map displays, stealth and command interfaces in greater numbers all at one site. These systems are divided into tactical combat and gunnery simulators. Getting the interoperability between both types of systems is an important requirement.Typically combat simulator configurations currently consist of a number of combat compartment replicas and generic simulators  in order to make the simulation system more flexible for the user. From simply company exercises through to combined exercises at battalion level the entire range of trining activities can be covered. Single scenario operation or simultaneously training in different scenarios are possible.Reconfiguration can be done by the system personal depending on training courses. The compartment replicas as well as the generic simulators and instructor stations are interlinked by a network using DIS resp. HLA standard protocols. Up to hundreds of objects like combat vehicles and armoured infantry combat vehicles, pioneer and artillery units, air defence and supply forces can operate in a realistic combat environment. A terrain database and the realistic behaviour of the intelligent scenario supervision based on computer generated forces (CGF) are essential components of tactical combat simulators.Those system configurations yields a high standard for the soldiers to be trained An example for a gunnery simulation system is AASL (german abbreviation for training simulator system LeFlaSys). AASL is the simulation system for LeFlaSys which is a short range air defence system of the German Army The system is composed of a reconnaissance radar vehicle and a number of weapon carrier vehicles with ground–air missiles (Stinger) on the platoon level. AASL consists of several manned cabins to simulate such a platoon. Lectures can be choosen manually by the instructor from a courseware catalog. The lectures include a number of exercises with different levels of complexity and demand. The exercises are executed successively and concentrating on a particular learning aim. The execution is not linear. It is controlled automatically by the CAI (Computer  Assisted Introduction) subsystem in an „intelligent way“ based on the results of the previous exercises. With the flexible courseware customers get an easy programmable exercise control and evaluation. For the communication AASL uses CORBA and DIS.In this work the development of  a next generation kernel-framework for simulator systems (abbreviated NGS) is presented and discussed. NGS must have the capabilities to combine tactical and gunnery systems to run exercises in both modes simultaneously. Modern communication architectures like the High Level Architecture (HLA) and the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) are used. Further a standard data model like ATCCIS will be used. The organization of the paper is as follows: A brief description of the currently implemented central management is given in section 2. In section 3 NGS is described in detail. A further discussion follows in sections 4 and finally there is a summary in section 5.2. The current Central ManagementThe currently used central management of our tactical combat simulator systems controls the networked manned cabins and workstations. The workstations are operating widely autonomously simulating friendly and opposing virtual entities, which get their tasks and orders from an instructor. The functionalities of the central management aregeneration and control of exercise sequences,ISS/CGF contol,Playback (Replay) and evaluation of exercises,deployment  of combat support,preparation and postprocessing of exercises,control and monitoring of the complete computer system.The DIS (Distributed Interactive Simulation) standard [11,12] and DIS+ (see [2]) respectively is used for the communication. The resource management is also based on DIS+. It would be possible to use HLA by a gateway solution for example but such an application is not the proper purpose of HLA.3. NGS: The new Kernel-FrameworkIn this section the new framework NGS – that will replace the current central management in the future - is described in detail. We will have a look at the general characteristics and the objective and technical requirements of NGS. An overview of a simulator system illustrates which kind of elements belong generally to a framework like NGS. The communication with HLA and CORBA and the importance of a standard data model like the ATCCIS data model for NGS is considerated. 3.1 Why a new Kernel?Of course, NGS will include the functionalities of the current central management. But why would we like to develop the new kernel? An important item is that the central managemant is not conceived for a simulator system which can run gunnery and tactical simulations simultaneously. Structural and functional extension ought to be simplified using modern coding techniques like object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD). NGS will have a modular design which yields a more configurable system. Assigning the roles to the wokstation will be easier so that the system will be more flexible.3.2 General characteristicsThe central components of  the new simulator system kernel  are:the networking (HLA, CORBA),the simulator and process control respectively,the exercise control,the data model including import and export functionalities.These components are realized by server, processes and libraries implementing services which provide functional units and resources. A resource denotes an overall self-sufficient component of the simulator system communicating by DIS and HLA respectively with other resources. For the users resources are the smallest manageable devices of a simulator system. Examples are:single simulators (manned cabins/combat rooms),workstations like CGF stations,Stealth (Flying Eye),Computer Assisted Introduction (CAI),Playback (Replay) andStatistics.Functional units are devices with an overall profile utilizable for various resources which can be identified and parameterized by the user. Examples aretactical map displays,computer generated images (CGI).3.3 Requirements 3.3.1 Objective RequirementsA list of special requirements for NGS was compiled based on the analysis of various existing and future products (like the OneSAF Objective System [20]) and actual proposals.Above all NGS requires a flexible resource management. A wide utilization of resources both for tactical simulation and gunnery training is desired. The system has to be configurable to allow the optional use of the different resources for particular functionalities in combat depending on the actual man power. Further it is necessary that tools are available for the configuration of the workstations corresponding to their roles (e.g. participant, intructor, maintenance staff).An approach for such a flexible and scalable resource management is the „Resource State Federation“ concept for modular simulator systems presented in [4] which is the implementation of the DIS+ resource management (see [2]) to HLA. The main characteristics of this concept are communication via HLA, filtering by federations on the RTI level and independence from the FOM. Therefore a particular so-called „Resource“ federation was created. This federation owns all available resources. The „Resource State Federation“ concept allows configuration of a simulator system dynamically regarding the number of scenarios and components running simultaneously. An illustration of a flexible resource management is shown in figure 1. In this context a sophisticated ‚Resource Configuration‘ (section 3.6) is another important point.Regarding the exercise control NGS demands that the simulator system is able to run tactical and gunnery training exercises at the same time. This system needs the facility to archive and to hold the current static and dynamic status (position and velocities of all objects for example) of the exercise and to generate markers if certain events occur.NGS will yield support for the preparation and postprocessing of exercises which is another important point. The internal data of manned cabins like switch settings ought to be stored. Statistical evaluation of  events and the reasons for damages and failures are desired. Special tools are necessary for these tasks.Particular man machine interface (MMI) features are communication charts for the configuration and distribution of communicative devices. For the selection of objects and entities tactical map display, object editor and communication charts are equivalent tools. Skills for the configuration of vechicles, CGF-parameters etc. are wanted for the system support. NGS will support the applications handling this tasks.NGS will also provide support for a CAI subsystem. The application of a CAI subsystem and a courseware are useful features especially for the gunnery simulation mode. Monitoring and control of a running lecture executing exercises in a scenario by the instructor is not necessary. The CAI selects automatically the right exercises to improve the skills of the participants. All details of a lecture are stored in a protocol which can be analyzed by an intructor after the lecture has stoped. The courseware has an object-oriented design using CORBA. Lectures, exercises, vehicles etc. are independent objects of the courseware. EINBETTEN PowerPoint.Show.8  Figure 1: The picture shows a configuration of a simulator system illustrating a flexible resource management for NGS. A Resource Pool which all available resources belong to is shown on the left side. On the right side different scenarios using various resources are presented. A HLA-network is used for communication.3.3.2 Technical RequirementsTechnical requirements for NGS are:object-oriented C++ coding,platform: LINUX or MS Windows,supported document generation from source code, application programming interface (API) as class libraries/CORBA services,no proprietary communication,traceability within the kernel, with the application software and with HLA,data management alternatively with SQL-data bases, XML, textfiles etc.development environment: Rational Rose.3.4 An Overview for Simulation SystemsVarious elements/components belong to a simulator system. For our new framework NGS we identified seven elements:Simulated World,Player,Observer,Master,Presenter,Developer andSimulation Control.All these elements have different characteristics and capabilities. Below they are considered in more detail (see also figure 4).The Simulated World is the image of the real world in a simulator system. It is reasonable to arrange the Simulated World in objectives, organization structures, communication (radio, C2-system e.g.) and scheduled orders which are issued to functional entities (command staff e.g.). Objectives are subdivided in static items - like contour lines of  terrain, road networks, static characteristics of  objects (length, weight etc.) - and dynamic items – like dynamic characteristics of  objects (position, velocity etc.), environmental conditions, effects (detonation e.g.).The hierachical formations of organizations are mapped as organization structures and divided in levels of command (platoon, company, battalion etc.). Each functional entity is integrated in the organization. With a mapping objects are assigned to functional entities .A Player is an autonomous resource or a functional unit and observes and is able to modify the Simulated World. There a player can be represented as self-contained object (manned cabin e.g.) or as control instrument for objects (CGF e.g.) and effects (firing impact).  A Player publishes and subscribes.An Observer is also an independent operating resource or functional unit respectively. But contrary to a Player an Observer – corresponding to its name – only observes the Simulated World. This means an Observer is only a Subscriber. Examples are a Stealth, data recording, Playback and statistics.A Master has the particular capability to create the Simulated World. He is able to load, to store, to start and to stop exercises. Further a Master can return to situations of an exercise in the past (Backtrack) and is competent to request and release Players and Observers. He also organizes the assignment of objects to Players.The Presenter manages the evaluation and representation of recorded exercise data (Playback , CAI evaluation ,  Stealth , Reports etc. )A Developer generates exercises and configures the system and models. System configuration is done by assigning objects to Players. Models are configured by changing the static characteristics of objects.The Simulation Control covers all control mechanisms of the simulation.3.5 Application of NGSAll elements of a simulator system have to use the NGS framework. Functional units and resources can be integrated in a system using the NGS Application Programming Interface (figure 5). This API is available for each application implemented as libraries, servers or processes. 3.6 Resource ConfigurationThe ‚Resource Configuration‘ describes the hardware and software compenents the complete simulator systems contains. The Resource Configuration is static and defines the configuration of the complete system and the possibilities to configure it for individual simulations. Concerning the hardware it is determined which computer machines exist and which types of  resource (combat rooms, workstations etc.) can be run (potentially) on the individual machines.  This includes which resource types may run synchronously an which are mutually exclusive. The description does not include which specific resources and machines are needed for an individual exercise. The Resource Configuration is stored in a file in XML-format.3.7 Communication: HLA and CORBAFigure 5 shows that the communication is realized with HLA [8,9,10,13] and CORBA [6,15]. The encapsulation of HLA with pSISA [14] could be an option but it is not discussed in this work.HLA enjoys a strong promotion but there are only few existing simulation systems based on it. On the other hand there is great demand for HLA by customers. For the new kernel HLA is used for the network machine communication and replaces DIS. HLA is especially relevant for modifying and observing the Simulated World like publishing, updating and subscribing for objects and interaction classes and their attributes and parameters. Ownership transfer and data filtering (data distribution management) belong to this item. Real-time applications could be problematical depending on the performance of the time management implementation.For the data management of the federation and simulation object models (FOM and SOM) the object model template (OMT) is the standardized data model. But the HLA OMT is not really object-oriented (see [10] e.g.). There are many FOM’s and SOM’s. Their contents depend on the application, developer etc.. The most widely-used FOM is the RPR-FOM [17] which is equivalent to DIS. It is also used for NGS. The actual new developed OOS (OneSAF Objective System, [20]) has an architecture based on HLA. FOM’s/SOM’s of different simulators shall be merged to a FOM of an arbitrary federation by a simple configuration process. HLA yields an interface definition [9] for the data exchange which offers a high degree of transparency for distributed simulations. But for the data exchange itself the implementation of an RTI (Run-Time Infrastructure) is necessary. Currently some RTI’s – probably only commercial ones in the near future - are offered by various producers. But offers of RTI’s according to the IEEE 1516 standard are still rare. (On the completition of this paper there is only the Pitch RTI [16] to complete the DMSO HLA verification process.) For NGS the RTI-NG1.3v4 [18] of the DMSO (Defence Modeling and Simulation Office) is used.The process communication between the exercise control and the server programs is realized by the object data pool and by message passing. The communication with message passing plays a major role in actual combat simulator systems. Each communication act is recorded as an event. Such protocols are very helpful for development and integration. In NGS this shall be realized with CORBA. CORBA is object-oriented, allows a machine overlapping communication and provides good load balancing. Structures and interfaces become clearer through the use of  IDL-interfaces.3.8 A standard data model for NGSOne of the central components of  NGS is a data model with its import and export functionalities. A uniform data model for the input situations and the results of the exercises is demanded. This is a hard constraint to realize the – first of all static - coupling of  different simulator systems among themselves and with C2I systems. Such a standard data model is ATCCIS the Army Tactical Command, Control and Information System [1]. ATCCIS is a favoured basis for a data model for the import and export capabilities of  NGS. At this point we will have a brief overview of ATCCIS. It contains two components: the data model and the replication mechanism. The data model is the standard LC2IEDM (Land C2I Exchange Data Model). The replication mechanism provides the data consistency and protects the identity of exchanged data. Entities in ATCCIS are Object-Item (individual objects), Object-Type (classes of objects), Action (activities), Capabilities (abilities to do work etc.), Location (specification of positions/geometry) and Reporting-Data (specification of source, quality and timing of reported data). Objects are subdivided into five categories: Organisation (units e.g.), Material (equipment, consumable material), Facility (infrastructure, bridges, minefields), Person and Feature (meteorology, geographic objects, abstract objects of combat).But ATCCIS contains only static data. The dynamic behavior of objects like vehicles and one-time events like detonations (associated with interactions in HLA) are not taken into consideration. A comparison of the data structures occuring in combat simulations and of ATCCIS shows a lot of conformity but also many differences (figure 2). Organization structures (platoons, battailons, etc.), environmental conditions (weather, time of day) and maintenance states (fuel, munition, damages etc.) are fitting well but certain geographic features, dynamic terrain and dynamic parameters are not suitable. While features denoted on common maps like roads, rivers, forrests and geodetic points and abstract spaces like defense areas, no-fly zones or concentration zones for example are elements of ATCCIS, characteristics like terrain contours, single trees, craters or soil conditions are missing.  This is also valid for dynamic parameters like the orientation of hull and turret of tanks, positions of  hatches and launching platforms of vehicles or the status of position lights. This means that a lot of  data described in the DIS-world and in the RPR-FOM for the HLA-world are not taken into consideration in the ATCCIS data model. This is analogous to the problem treated in the case  VERKNÜPFUNG PowerPoint.Show.8 "\\\\ENTE\\user\\sle\\sle3\\dobrindt\\Windows\\Personal\\sim_atccis_1.ppt" "" \a \p Figure 2: Data structures occuring in combat simulations compared with ATCCIS.study in assessment of data alignment between the ATCCIS data model and the WARSIM Object Model [5].In summary this comparison demonstrates that ATCCIS does not satisfy all needs required by a tactical and gunnery simulation system. The consequences one has to draw are discussed in section 4.4. ConclusionsThe description in section 3 representes a modern concept for the NGS framework. In this section we review some particular items of the previous description.Simulator systems like AASL show that the application of DIS and CORBA is profitable. Benefits of product range overlapping synergies using HLA and CORBA for NGS are expected. A factor which must be considered is that the further development and support of the DMSO RTI – using CORBA itself - could be run down in the near future. Eventuelly, no further upgrades to RTI-NG1.3 capabilities will be undertaken by DMSO and also no upgrading of any ports for an IEEE 1516 RTI  to open this market entirely to the commercial world [3]. An interesting alternative can be the german RTI project GERTICO [7] which generates the HLA services using CORBA services. In this context the compability of different ORB’s (Object Request Brokers) has to be taken into consideration if an RTI based un CORBA (like DMSO RTI or GERTICO) is used. Federate applications implementing CORBA directly must use the same ORB and version as the RTI. Decoupled applications (clients/servers) can in principle use different ORB’s.The benefits of a courseware catalog and a CAI subsystem were already mentioned above. They are an important feature for NGS. Their application will be valuable for all domains in virtual simulation.In paragraph 3.8 the capabilities of ATCCIS for NGS were described. It was determined that it is not possible to register all kind of data occuring in combat simulations in the ATCCIS data model. In spite of this it is important to regard this data model for NGS. Because the ATCCIS Generic Hub 4 (GH4) data model [1] is the core data model LC2IEDM (Land C2I Exchange Data Model) which is the basis for the Nato Corporate Data Model (NCDM). The LC2IEDM is also used for the Corporate Data Model  M&S (Modeling & Simulation) and for the database „Support M&S“ of the german army. Beyond it, ATCCIS is that standard model for  C2I systems. Thus this data model has to be considered if a coupling between NGS-simulator systems and C2I systems is demanded. It follows that the ATCCIS data model must be extended to apply in combat simulation systems (figure 3). Of course, extensions which are only known in the own system, are normally realizable. But under these points of view a general extension of the ATCCIS data model is preferable or virtually required.5. SummaryIn this paper we presented a new kernel for simulation systems called NGS. The general characteristics show that the functionalities of the currently deployed central management are included in NGS. The requirements demonstrate the modern object-oriented concept. Together with the modular design NGS will be more configurable and simpler for structural and functional extensions. The overview of the elements beloging to a simulator system yields an image of what NGS has to perform. Further it clarifies that the design is done in a general way so that the NGS framework will be usable for combined gunnery and tactical simulation systems. Communication techniques for NGS are HLA (to replace DIS) and CORBA. A standard data model for the kernel is demanded to store input situations and results in standard format. The data model of ATCCIS has to be considered because of the projected coupling of simulator systems with C2I systems in the future. But therefore the ATCCIS data model must be extended by data structures occuring especially in combat simulations. Simulation systems and C2I systems have much in common but there is more harmonization between both communities necessary (see also [19]). Standardized interfaces and methods have to be found to couple such systems in a rational way. This will be also helpful to reuse approved methods and solutions and make it possible to save time and money. VERKNÜPFUNG PowerPoint.Show.8 "\\\\ENTE\\user\\sle\\sle3\\dobrindt\\Windows\\Personal\\sim_atccis_2.ppt" "" \a \p Figure 3: General extensions of the ATCCIS data model are required.6.
