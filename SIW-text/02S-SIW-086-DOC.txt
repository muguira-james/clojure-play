The IEWTPT program has evolved in response to a need documented in a Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) directed study in 1980.  Military Intelligence soldiers in tactical units were not conducting effective training nor did those units possess the equipment to conduct effective training.  Tactical Military Intelligence (MI) units need a means to simulate an opposing force on their ground stations and provide the soldiers operating the Intelligence and Electronic Warfare (IEW) systems a realistic picture of the battlefield.  Using this realistic picture, the MI soldiers can conduct analysis, write and file reports, change tasking of the sensor vehicle, and do any of the tasks that could be done on the IEW system receiving real world data.  When integrated into a large-scale exercise driven by a  constructive simulation, the MI soldier provides man-in-the-loop analysis to the intelligence battlestaff, which in turn will result in increased realism for the training audience.  IEWTPT Phase One:  CSTARCombat Synthetic Training Assessment Range (CSTAR) was originally developed by the Test and Evaluation Command (TECOM) in conjunction with the Battle Command Battle Lab Huachuca (BCBL-H) to support testing.  CSTAR was incorporated into the Federation of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Targeting, Operations, and Research Models (FIRESTORM) intelligence simulation strategy and was successfully demonstrated at the Task Force XXI Advanced Warfighting Experiment (AWE) in March of 1997.  This successful demonstration resulted in CSTAR being selected for the Warfighting Rapid Acquisition Program (WRAP).  CSTAR is a battle command training system that provides collective training for brigade-sized organizations at the National Training Center (NTC), Fort Irwin, CA and Fort Hood, TX.  At Ft. Hood CSTAR consists of three components:  the Janus constructive simulation, fixed site equipment, and a brigade TOC.  Janus provides scenario data to the fixed site component, which contains the sensor/platform models.  The fixed site, in turn processes the scenario data and provides it to the Brigade TOC.  The Brigade TOC is tethered to the fixed site component with fiber optics and consists of surrogate or tactical workstations for the Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) Common Ground Station (CGS), the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Ground Control Station (GCS) and the All Source Analysis Remote Workstation (ASAS-RWS).  MI soldiers man the surrogate or tactical workstations.  At NTC, the CSTAR environment is augmented by an Instrumentation System Transition Module, which provides data on the instrumented live players to the Fixed Site component as well as the Janus constructive simulation data. A mobile component consists of the surrogate workstations and is linked to the Fixed Site component via a wireless link and the Brigade TOC via fiber optics.  The merged live and constructive data is provided to the CSTAR models in the fixed site and then sent to the Brigade TOC to stimulate the IEW workstations for exploitation.CSTAR has six main objectives:  1) to extend the battlespace at NTC by merging the live instrumented players with simulated “wrap around” forces in a single virtual scenario, 2) to simulate sensor/intel platforms to a fidelity necessary for Battle Command Training including a SIGINT sensor model, JSTARS Moving Target Indicator (MTI) model and a Multiple Unified Simulation Environment (MUSE) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle video telemetry model, 3) to train as they fight on actual or surrogate C4ISR systems ASAS-RWS, JSTARS CGS, and UAV GCS, 4) train the C4ISR operators as they fight in the field via the mobile component, 5) to provide quick turnaround debrief in both the field and fixed sites, and 6) to provide a completely supported leave behind capability. IEWTPT: The next StepFunctional realism of the current family of simulations is insufficient to adequately train the Intelligence Battlefield Operating System (IBOS).  Constructive simulations drive the command and control processes that synchronize combat resources to defeat an enemy normally using a well-defined doctrine.  Simulations have a limited ability to realistically portray all of the systems in the battlespace.  This creates an artificial environment where activities are often automated or have unrealistic effects on the simulated battle, particularly in the IEW arena.  Current intelligence simulations (Battlefield Intelligence Collection Model (BICM) and Tactical Simulation (TACSIM)) provide  commanders with “ground truth” without the IBOS interaction or with the lack of robustness needed to reflect the IBOS capabilities in a dynamic extended battlespace.  In large scale computer assisted exercises like those conducted by the Battle Command Training Program (BCTP), the IBOS is not adequately stimulated and therefore of little value in realistically training commanders and battlestaff in the use and capability of the intelligence assets at their disposal.  Furthermore, a training opportunity for the intelligence staff, analysts and system operators is lost.  IEWTPT will provide for individual, crew and collective training for the IBOS.  An IEWTPT model that will provide a realistic picture of the battlespace on their IEW system will stimulate soldiers manning the IEW systems.  The collection manager will be able to task his various sensors and collection assets in order to meet the commander’s objectives for his intelligence assets.  The intelligence battlestaff will conduct realistic intelligence fusion and analysis using reports from the soldier/analyst.  Commanders will make decisions based on realistic intelligence products provided by his staff and not intelligence products provided by computer simulations.  The IEWTPT system shall complete the interaction between battle command staff and the IBOS.  The system will replicate the interdependent processes and stresses encountered in wartime and provide opportunities that force the commander to develop and manage intelligence requirements.  IEWTPT will drive intelligence soldiers and systems to answer operational needs and support staff/unit sustainment training.  IEWTPT System Overview The IEWTPT consists of four major components representing functional groupings of capabilities:  1) the Technical Control Cell (TCC), 2) Target Signature Arrays (TSAs), 3) the constructive simulation, and 4) training range instrumentation interface.  The TCC controls all communication between the constructive simulation and the IEW processing and collection systems.  Control functions of the TCC include:  segregating and linking the tactical IEW processing systems to provide individual, collective, and unit level training; collecting training data for the After Action Review (AAR); and providing to the constructive simulation the status of the tactical IEW system.  The TCC will enhance the constructive simulation runtime state variables to provide the data to the TSAs.  The TSAs may be an embedded capability, a strap-on capability or some combination which injects the TCC provided content into the IEW tactical systems.  The constructive simulation is the scenario driver for the IEWTPT training system and provides the runtime state variables and the synthetic environment.  The training range instrumentation interface will be used at the NTC, the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC), Ft. Polk, LA and the Combat Maneuver Training Center (CMTC), Hohenfels, Germany to provide data to the TCC from live, instrumented units.  There is also a requirement to provide an interface to the Homestation Instrumentation System (HITS) when it is fielded.         Figure 1. IEWTPT Schematic2.1 Technical Control Cell (TCC)The TCC provides a realistic target environment to ensure full functionality for the IEW systems.  The environment will support Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) (including Communications Intelligence (COMINT) and Electronics Intelligence (ELINT)), Imagery Intelligence (IMINT), Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT), and Human Intelligence (HUMINT).  The TCC will take data from the constructive simulation and enhance that data enough to realistically portray the operational environment on the TSA.  The TCC must be capable of stimulating multiple TSAs simultaneously.  As many as nine different TSAs may be networked into the IEWTPT computers.  The TCC consists of several computers comprising three system types:  1) the Gateway workstations which conduct High Level Architecture (HLA) Federation Object Model (FOM) normalization, 2) the Intelligence workstations which provide for all that is necessary to turn the data from the constructive simulation and instrumentation systems into useful data for the TSAs, and 3) the Output workstations which provide for the data to be placed on the HLA Run Time Infrastructure (RTI) for communication to the various TSAs as well as transferred internally to AAR and Exercise management functions resident within the TCC.2.2 Target Signature Arrays (TSAs)The IEWTPT system will stimulate the actual system’s operator stations via TSAs.  The TSAs will be either an embedded training system or a strap-on training system developed by the IEW system Project Managers in cooperation with the IEWTPT Project Manager.  The nine TSAs that will be part of the IEWTPT system are:-JSTARS Common Ground Station-Tactical UAV Ground Control Station-GUARDRAIL Common Sensor (GRCS) Integrated Processing Facility (IPF)-PROPHET (Ground, Control)-Improved Remotely Monitored Battlefield Sensor System (I-REMBASS)-Tactical Exploitation System (TES) and Division TES (DTES)-Aerial Common Sensor (ACS)-Airborne Reconnaissance-Multipurpose (ARL-M)-Counterintelligence (CI) Human Intelligence (HUMINT) Automation Tool Set (CHATS)The TCC has the requirement to interface with all nine of the different types of TSAs at once and as many as 90 TSAs federated in a large-scale interactive exercise.Constructive SimulationThe constructive simulation that will drive the IEWTPT system is the Warfighter Simulation (WARSIM) and WARSIM Intelligence Module (WARSIM/WIM).  WARSIM/WIM are both federates of the Joint Simulation System (JSIMS).  The IEWTPT will subscribe to the required data using the JSIMS FOM and the HLA RTI.  WARSIM/WIM will publish data such as aggregated unit data, radar and jammer emissions, radio transmissions, constructive simulation start and stop commands, and various tactical messages.  This data will be enhanced to meet the training requirements of the various TSAs and then published to the IEWTPT FOM and made available to the TSAs using the Defense Modeling and Simulation Office’s (DMSO) RTI. Data that will be available to the TSAs will be disaggregated entity level object data, simulation data, tactical messages (including internals in a foreign language for SIGINT training).  Objects generated by either the TCC or TSAs, interactions and network data will be made available to the JSIMS FOM for WARSIM/WIM AAR purposes and exercise control.  Additionally, the TCC will publish internal exercise management data, network status data, and AAR data.The constructive simulation provides the scenario, units, activity, and synthetic natural environment to drive IEWTPT training events.  The IEWTPT system will provide the fidelity, content, and infrastructure to allow for realistic intelligence training.  The IEWTPT system will also record the constructive simulation scenarios and data for future intelligence training without the overhead of a large scale constructive training event.   Figure 2 TCC Computer SystemsInstrumentation InterfaceThe training range instrumentation interface allows the IEWTPT system to be used in live training.  Currently the training of IEW assets during live exercises is limited by the lack of availability of the actual IEW systems due to operational considerations, scheduling conflicts or expense. The instrumentation interface when combined with the constructive simulation interface will provide a realistic picture of the extended battlespace.   Instrumentation systems at the various training centers are in various phases of fielding.  The National Training Center is updating its instrumentation system to the Objective Instrumentation System, which will use HLA, but fielding at the NTC will precede the fielding of OIS.  IEWTPT is also required to interface with the Homestation Instrumentation System (HITS) when fielded.Training ModesThe original mission needs statement addressed the inability of Military Intelligence soldier to maintain his skills.  The IEWTPT was conceived to address this problem with individual training but it extends beyond that.  With modern networking equipment, the IEWTPT will address collective, unit, and battlestaff training as well as individual training.  The IEWTPT system will operate in three training modes, which will provide for a different training focus.  The three modes are 1) the integrated training mode, which will focus on individual operator, unit level and battlestaff training, 2) the TCC playback mode which will focus on individual operator, collective training and the training of the collection manager, and 3) the TSA standalone mode which will focus on individual operator training.  3.1 Integrated ModeIn the integrated mode, the Constructive Simulation provides doctrinally correct scenarios that the TCC translates into the necessary data that is transmitted to the TSAs to stimulate the tactical IEW system.  This will normally be done under the context of a larger computer assisted exercise such as a Warfighter Exercise (WFX) sponsored by the Battle Command Training Program (BCTP).  The integrated mode will be conducted in real time, that is, as actions occur in the simulation, the IEW operator will see those actions on his tactical IEW system.  The integrated mode provides the most complete training providing individual training for the IEW operator, collective training for the collection managers, section managers, and MI unit leaders, and battlestaff training for both the MI battlestaff and the maneuver battlestaff that depends on the intelligence products to assist them in developing plans, orders, and contingencies.  Figure 3 Integrated Training ModeDuring an integrated exercise the constructive simulation “turns off” the IEW asset being played by IEWTPT.  For example, if JSTARS CGS were part of the IEWTPT exercise, then all reports would be generated by the CGS operator, and the constructive simulation would turn off its ability to automatically generate reports as if there were no CGS operator taking part.  TCC Playback ModeThe TCC Playback mode focuses on the collective training of the MI unit.  It provides for the training of multiple TSAs  without the overhead of an interactive constructive simulation.  In other words, if an MI unit would like to conduct MI specific training using maneuver assets, it can do so without actually involving maneuver units.  In the TCC Playback mode, the TCC plays a previously recorded constructive simulation scenario.  The data from the scenario is enhanced just as it is in the integrated mode and transmitted to the TSAs that are in the IEWTPT network.  Military Intelligence unit commanders can tailor this training to specific IEW assets or include all IEW assets, staff sections, and units under their command.  The TCC will record the constructive simulation scenario with enough fidelity to support re-planning and re-tasking of IEW assets by the collection manager and to support changing routes and areas of interest for the IEW operator.  The IEW operator will not be limited to the same mission planning and tasking used in the original constructive simulation scenario, however, it will not be possible to alter the maneuver units.  Figure 4 TCC Playback ModeTSA Standalone ModeMI units will use the TSA Standalone mode to conduct individual operator training on the IEW asset.  In the TSA standalone mode, the TSA uses data recorded from the TCC to provide a realistic operational picture for the IEW operator.  The TSA Standalone mode is the most basic of the training modes for IEWTPT.  It supports sustainment training and provides the opportunity for MI soldiers to practice and enhance their abilities on the IEW system.  Training on the system will be limited to the portion of the scenario recorded by the specific TSA.  IEW operators will have a limited ability to change routes or the mission of their specific sensor.Fielding ConsiderationsThe IEWTPT will be fielded at the Intelligence Center and School at Ft. Huachuca, AZ; each of the Corps Headquarters sites at Ft. Hood, TX, Ft. Lewis, WA, Ft. Bragg, NC, and Heidelberg, Germany; and at each of the maneuver training centers at Ft. Irwin, CA, Ft. Polk, LA and Hohenfels, Germany.  4.1  SecurityTraining at the Training Centers is normally conducted at the unclassified level, however, the use of IEW assets in live training require that at least some of the training be conducted at the classified level.  Because of the multiple security classifications of the TSAs and the requirement for multiple security enclaves at the training centers, the IEWTPT system must be capable of operating in multiple security enclaves.  In order to handle multiple enclaves the TCCs will be networked to the constructive simulation at the appropriate security level.  WARSIM/WIM has the requirement to operate in two security enclaves, and one TCC will be networked to the WARSIM simulation while another TCC is networked to the WIM simulation.  The Radiant Mercury trusted guard, allowing data to flow from the lower enclave to the upper enclave, but preventing data from flowing in the reverse, separates WARSIM and WIM.   The Training Centers will be handled in a similar fashion, using one TCC networked to the constructive simulation. Figure 5 Multiple Enclave Security4.2 IEWTPT DependenciesAs mentioned earlier, IEWTPT is dependent upon WARSIM/WIM to provide the constructive simulation scenario to conduct intelligence training.  Even when running in the TCC Playback mode, WARSIM/WIM will be the scenario driver, albeit in a relatively non-interactive environment.  Fielding at the Corps Headquarters provides the optimum location to impact the greatest number of exercises and provide training to the greatest number of military intelligence soldiers, crews, units and staffs.  At all sites except Ft. Huachuca, WARSIM/WIM will be fielded before IEWTPT is fielded.  Ft. Huachuca will use the IEWTPT system primarily to train individual operators in a classroom environment, so the use of recorded WARSIM scenarios will have a minor impact on training.  TCCs located at Corps Headquarters sites can be networked to support intelligence training at remote sites, such as Division or Military Intelligence Brigade Headquarter locations.  A corps MI Brigade commander can train the operators of her IEW assets supported by IEWTPT, anywhere those assets may be located and without the requirement for maneuver units to be involved.5.0 Conclusion    IEWTPT fills a training need that has been identified and unfilled as long ago as 1980.  Individual IEW operators will have the tools to maintain proficiency on their systems.  In large scale constructive exercises, commanders will now rely on their intelligence analysts, collection managers, and battlestaffs, rather than on products generated by the constructive simulation.  The added realism will enhance not only the intelligence BOS, but also the battlestaffs of all BOSs. Author BiographiesCAROL ANN HESS is a Senior Software Engineer for General Dynamics Decision Systems in Orlando, FL.
