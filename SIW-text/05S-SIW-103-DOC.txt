The One Tactical Engagement Simulation System (OneTESS) will serve as a dual-purpose simulation system for use by the Joint Training and Testing communities.  Consisting of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products and current and future military technology, all integrated with a variety of tools such as the Common Training Instrumentation Architecture (CTIA), High Level Architecture (HLA), Test and Evaluation Network Architecture (TENA), and the Next Range Instrumentation (NexRI), OneTESS will simulate the rigorous environments commonly associated with both Force-on-Force (FOF) and Force-on-Target (FOT) training and operational testing.  One key aspect of the OneTESS, engagement resolution, will draw upon new and innovative solutions previously considered impossible because of technological constraints.  While current training and/or testing systems primarily relied upon line-of-sight engagement resolution tactics, OneTESS will use geo-pairing methods that eliminate the need for the shooting weapon to acquire a target visually to complete an engagement.  Using geo-pairing will improve the versatility and dependability of OneTESS as well as impede efforts to cheat.  This paper serves as a survey of current line-of-sight technology and discusses the different systems that have relied upon line-of-sight engagement, the advantages and pitfalls of line-of-sight engagement resolution, and how geo-pairing will stand as an advance in Joint training and operational testing leading to corresponding advances in Joint operational readiness.                            IntroductionBeginning in the 1970’s with the Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) [1], Tactical Engagement Simulation (TES) has stood as the Army’s definitive infantry training system [2].  Using TES systems for training, the Army can effectively prepare for situations that require the use of advanced weapon systems such as the Land Warrior system shown in Figure 1.  While TES systems provide excellent individual training, they also allow for team training with variously configured deployments.  At the most fundamental level, a TES system is a laser-tag training system.  Entities such as dismounted infantry, vehicles, armor, and aircraft shoot encoded infrared laser beams from their respective weapons.  Additionally, each entity possesses infrared sensors to detect laser beams fired from other weapons.  The TES systems resolve these engagements based upon the type of munitions, the type of entity that was hit, and where that entity was hit.  For instance, a simulated M-16 rifle bullet that hits a tank directly upon a plate of armor would likely register as a harmless hit resulting in no damage.  On the other hand, 120mm shell fired by an M1A1 main battle tank that hits a dismounted infantry soldier would likely resolve as a kill.Figure 1.  Land Warrior System [3]Among the many advantages of a TES system are:Allows the use of an integrated training system for direct fire force-on-force training for individuals, vehicles and weaponsProvides a significant reduction in life cycle costsUses technology that allows an accurate and flexible training system  (MILES is not considered an accurate system, it is considered sufficient to meet training requirements for combined arms training)Reduces the training equipment weight, resulting in more transparency for soldiersIncludes After Action Review (AAR) systems to enhance the level of training [4]However, these systems have historically had glaring weaknesses.  These limitations include:Communications limitationsA disconnect between the Testing and the Training communitiesCheating loopholes for exercise participantsAAR limitationsInability to fully track positions/locations of entitiesNon-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) and Beyond-Line-of-Sight (BLOS) engagements [2]Despite the disadvantages, TES systems have performed reasonably well for direct fire engagements.  However, one of the most technically challenging issues for TES systems pertains to the resolution of NLOS and BLOS engagements.  NLOS engagements occur when an obstacle stands between the shooter and a target during an engagement, as seen in Figure 2.  Similarly, BLOS engagements occur when the target stands beyond the horizon from the shooter’s position, as demonstrated in Figure 3.  Essentially, in a BLOS engagement, the earth is the obstacle between the shooter and the target.  Because the laser beams used by traditional TES systems travel in a straight line, those systems do not resolve NLOS and BLOS engagements.  OneTESS shall address this shortcoming. EMBED PowerPoint.Slide.8  Figure 2.  Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) engagement [5] EMBED PowerPoint.Slide.8  Figure 3.  Beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) engagement [5]One Tactical Engagement System (OneTESS) OneTESS is the next-generation TES, the broader name clearly reflecting the broader mission of OneTESS.  Live training for military purposes dates back to prehistoric times [6].  Hand-to-hand combat drills under highly constrained conditions and target practice probably have histories as long as that of warfare, itself.  With the introduction of MILES in the 1970s, live tactical training took a quantum leap forward.  For the first time, soldiers could conduct force-on-force training under safe and, at the same time, relatively unconstrained conditions.  The application of what was then state-of-the-art laser technology enabled this advance, but this technology now faces three significant disadvantages: Lasers cannot represent indirect fire, or NLOS/BLOS engagements Lasers beams can be blocked by opaque and translucent obscurants that would be useless in stopping bullets, such as foliage and fogThe systems are nearing the end of their useful economic life, particularly with regards to logistics support issues, such as part replacement While this paper focuses on the first issue, OneTESS will address all of these shortcomings in providing the military with a new TES based on 21st century state-of-the-art technology.  Despite its connection to legacy systems, OneTESS will emerge as an entirely new system, built from the beginning with an eye to the future of the U.S. Military, including the Future Combat Systems (FCS) where OneTESS will act as an embedded training component.OneTESS will follow a complex migration path.  Initial fielding will include an emphasis on appended components and interoperability with the currently fielded MILES equipment.  The fielded system will evolve into a standard for embedded use in FCS vehicles.  In addition, OneTESS will significantly support advancement in power generation, exercise management, and data storage along with improved distributed adjudication algorithms [7].A number of tools will support OneTESS in reaching the requirements the effort has promised to fulfill.  The following section details a few of the more noteworthy of those.ToolsAny system as complex as OneTESS must receive support from numerous sources.  OneTESS will rely upon many different tools from design all the way through fielding and execution.  The following subsections describe some of these tools.Common Training Instrumentation Architecture (CTIA)CTIA serves as the common core architecture for the OIS programs at the National Training Center (NTC), the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC), and Combat Maneuver Training Center (CMTC).  CTIA also has a major role within the instrumentation system programs for several home stations and the JRTC Military Operations in Urbanized Terrain (MOUT) facility [8].  OneTESS will comply with CTIA and will use CTIA-provided services for functions that include scenario generation, exercise control, and AAR.  This commitment to CTIA demonstrates the intention of the OneTESS team to support the emerging Live Training Transformation (LT2) agenda, and ensures that OneTESS shall comply with instrumentation technologies and applications.  Figure 4 below illustrates the overall intent of CTIA. SHAPE  \* MERGEFORMAT Figure 4.  Vision of CTIA [9]Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA)A product stemming from the Foundation Initiative 2010 (FI 2010) project that is sponsored by the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP), TENA builds upon the advances made by such architectures as the Defense Information Infrastructure Common Operating Environment (DII COE) and the High-Level Architecture (HLA).  The underlying backbone of TENA is its TENA Common Infrastructure, which includes the TENA Middleware, the TENA Repository, and the TENA Logical Range Data Archive.  To perform its set of tasks, TENA also specifies the existence of several tools and utilities, including those necessary for the creation of a logical range [10].  According to [11], a logical range, “integrates existing testing, training, simulation, and high-performance computing technologies, distributed across many facilities, and ties them together using the elements of a common architecture.”  Range instrumentation systems and the tools associated with TENA interact with the common infrastructure by way of the TENA object model.  The TENA object model encodes all data communicated between the various systems during a range event.  All TENA applications communicate using this common object model.Figure 5 illustrates the TENA architecture as presented by The Source for Environmental Representation and Interchange (SEDRIS). EMBED PowerPoint.Slide.8  Figure 6.  TENA Architecture Overview [12]High Level Architecture (HLA)The HLA standard protocol (IEEE 1516.x) forms the basis for a great deal of simulation interoperability, particularly amongst constructive simulations.  An HLA simulation, called a federation, consists of the disparate simulators, called federates, and an implementation of the HLA standard, called a Run-Time Infrastructure (RTI).  HLA works as a broadcast network, where federates publish simulation data and only the federates within the federation that have subscribed to that simulation data process the information.  HLA has become a widely used architecture to facility interoperability within a distributed simulation systems.  OneTESS will include an HLA-interface to enable participation in Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) exercises.  This interface is separate from, and in addition to, OneTESS’ compliance with the CTIA and TENA architectures and services [13].Next Range Instrumentation (NexRI)The NexRI initiative uses a business model approach and will produce standards to which new range systems may be manufactured and integrated that will result in improved interoperability of systems between ranges and services.  The standards should also allow upgrades in legacy systems to help achieve interoperability between air, ground, and live instrumentation as well as between virtual and constructive training networks [14].Although the precise definitions for CTIA, TENA, and NexRI are still developing amongst the contributors and planned users of the tools and services, the OneTESS team constantly participates in planning discussions and intends to comply as broadly as possible with these emerging standards and architectures, while remaining interoperable with legacy HLA federations.NLOS and BLOS Requirements for OneTESSAs mentioned previously, despite the historical effectiveness of various TES systems, a glaring shortcoming is their collective inability to cope proficiently with NLOS and BLOS engagements.  As a result, OneTESS clearly elevates NLOS and BLOS issues to a high priority, as evidenced by a number of official requirements dedicated to them.  The Operational Requirements Document (ORD) [15] states:“OneTESS will provide realistic simulation of NLOS and BLOS munitions and their effects on targets by live, constructive, and virtual units for all systems in the inventory (to include threat systems) and will be reprogrammable to support the addition of future systems.  OneTESS will simulate BLUFOR and OPFOR weapons-locating radars and other defensive systems.”These two statements from the ORD demonstrate the importance placed on having accurate and comprehensive NLOS and BLOS capabilities included in the design of the OneTESS.  More specifically, this portion of the requirements document is calling for a simulation of NLOS and BLOS engagements that more closely matches the corresponding behaviors from the real world.  It also specifically makes mention of the need for this capability to cover not only BLUFOR entities, but also for any sort of OPFOR entity as well, adding to the overall value of the training from such a system.The ORD goes on to state:“NLOS/BLOS weapon effect simulation capabilities will include OICW, MK-19, hand grenade, mortar, artillery, and Claymore [for threshold]; all NLOS/BLOS weapon systems [for objective].”This statement further augments the original claim by provided added specificity about the expectations of the OneTESS.  It accomplishes this by naming specific weapon systems that would related directly to NLOS and BLOS engagements.  It should also be noted that these requirements are objective in nature, stipulating that they should be satisfied at chronologically later point in time during the OneTESS project.Geo-PairingThe OneTESS requirements for NLOS and BLOS dictate the use of new technology in understanding the point of impact or detonation from a round in which the target is invisible to the shooter.  This new technique is known as Geometric Pairing or Geo-Pairing, for short.  To calculate the destination point, this technology must know the location of the shooter and target, the time at which the shooter pulled the trigger, the characteristics of the weapon and ammunition, and the orientation vector of the weapon.  Intuitively, this calculation appears straightforward, though a number of complicated issues exist:Timing delays associated with accurate Global Positioning Systems (GPS)Messaging between systemsWhat engagement geometry to apply based on the type of engagementWhat arbitration approach to take (i.e. multiple targets versus single target)The casualty assessment outcomeNotifying target and logging systems of that outcome.The following section describes some of the challenges associated with Geo-Pairing in greater detail.Architectural Challenges Associated with Geo-PairingThe intended use for OneTESS is to simulate exercises for FoF or FoT training.  Because of this intent, the final system will incorporate a wide range of player units that includes: VehiclesWeaponsMunitionsIndividualsEach entity will possess its own onboard computer system to simulate or stimulate the battlefield and its effects.  Furthermore, the player units will need to communicate amongst each other, either through distributed communication, through a centralized system using a Common Data Link (CDL), or using a composite of both strategies.  The distributed approach calculates the geometric-pairing at the player unit, whereas in the centralized approach a computer system located on the CDL performs the calculations.  Moreover, OneTESS could use a semi-centralized approach in which calculations for varying portions take place either at the CDL or at the player unit.  Understanding the appropriate application of each approach is a challenge.  Moreover, knowing when to handoff the calculations based off the current events within the battlefield increases the complexity of the problem.OneTESS M&S ArchitectureTo understand the timing constraints that will confine the system and to ensure that each sub-system (i.e. player unit) will work within those constraints, OneTESS has developed a three-pronged architecture approach to solving this problem.  OneTESS modeling and simulation analysis effort focuses on three major areas:     •     Simulation of the architecture,  •     Engineering simulation of OneTESS design  •     Battlefield dynamicsThe first of these areas, architecture simulation, pertains to using a discrete event simulation, ExtendTM, to investigate OneTESS risk areas.  The ExtendTM simulation tool uses a message-based architecture, necessary for the OneTESS effort  This allows the team to understand the communication amongst the player units and the CDL.  Furthermore, Extend allows composability of multiple models.  Extend can then place the calculation times within these models to enhance the outcome.  Analysis of the OneTESS system would encompass such issues as:Understanding the occurrence of deadlockMessage orderCommunication lossCalculations of detonations or impact locationsAdjudication of the battlefieldThe second architecture focus is an engineering simulation of the OneTESS design.  This effort will comprise of generic models, such as a geo-pairing algorithm and a ballistics algorithm, with defined interfaces.  Engineering algorithms that support the interface and are appropriate for the designed model will replace each generic model.  Tools will then collect performance measurements, including the time calculations, once they are established.  The Extend simulation tool will then use the performance measurement data to develop an accurate analysis of the OneTESS architecture.The final architectural analysis component pertains to simulating the battlefield dynamics.  The OneTESS team will use the OneSAF Testbed (OTB) to create a brigade-level battlefield modified that includes OneTESS engineering models and network models.  This system will aid the architecture team in evaluating OneTESS system performance.  The measures of effectiveness (MOEs) and measures of performance (MOPs) will include the timeliness of the battle outcome, scalability of the system, and communication connectivity.  Each architectural component relies upon the others to accurately understand how the OneTESS system will perform and how best to minimize the risks.  The use of Geo-Pairing will greatly enhance the live training spectrum.  However, it accompanies many technical challenges, such as the capability to accurately reflect impact and detonation location.  The OneTESS team anticipates that by simulating the architecture early, it can minimize – or even remove – issues affecting the Geo-Pairing calculations [16] [17] [18] [19] [20].ConclusionSince the 1970’s, the U.S. Army has extensively used TES systems for their infantry training exercises.  The reasons for this longtime usage vary from the ability of TES systems to integrate a variety of disparate training systems to significant reductions in life-cycle costs.  Despite the numerous advantages that have come from training with such a system for the last thirty years, a number of shortcomings have also stood out during that same time.  Among the most notable is the systems’ inability to handle NLOS and BLOS engagements effectively.The OneTESS system will address this particular shortcoming by ensuring that these types of engagements are modeled realistically, thus enhancing the training value.  To augment the ability of OneTESS to simulate NLOS and BLOS engagements effectively, much will take place from the design phase all the way through fielding and execution of OneTESS testing and training exercises.  Quite importantly, OneTESS will use a number of tools, such as CTIA, TENA, HLA, and NexRI to enhance its ability to handle these engagements.This paper has outlined those tools, the OneTESS NLOS and BLOS requirements, and some of the problems specific to NLOS and BLOS engagements, much in the form of a survey document.  It also sets the table for follow-on papers that will update the community on progress towards a comprehensive and effective solution for modeling such engagements.  Those follow-on papers will proceed as the research dictates.References[1]	“History of MILES”, HYPERLINK "http://www.peostri.army.mil/PRODUCTS/MILES_XXI/history.jsp" http://www.peostri.army.mil/PRODUCTS/MILES_XXI/history.jsp.[2]	Schricker, Bradley C., “What is a OneTESS?” Proceedings of the 2004 Fall Simulation Interoperability Workshop, September 2004.[3]	“Land Warrior,” Federation of American Scientists,  HYPERLINK "http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/land-warrior.htm" http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/land-warrior.htm[4]	“Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System,”  HYPERLINK "http://www.peostri.army.mil/PRODUCTS/MILES/" http://www.peostri.army.mil/PRODUCTS/MILES/[5]	“Objective Force Warrior,” General Dynamics,  HYPERLINK "http://www.generaldynamics.com/prod_serv/combat/OFW/ofwgraphics_new.htm" http://www.generaldynamics.com/prod_serv/combat/OFW/ofwgraphics_new.htm.[6] Sleight, Deborah Alpert, “A Developmental History of Training in the United States and Europe,” Michigan State University, December 1993.[7]	“AT&T OneTESS System Concept Contract Data Requirements List,” AT&T Government Solutions, Inc., technical paper.[8]	“Common Training Instrumentation Architecture (CTIA)”,  HYPERLINK "http://www.peostri.army.mil/PM-TRADE/ctia.jsp" http://www.peostri.army.mil/PM-TRADE/ctia.jsp.[9]	“Common Training Instrumentation Architecture Portal”,https://ssl.peostri.army.mil:443/CTIAPortal/index.jsp.[10]	“TENA – The Test and Training Enabling Architecture,”  HYPERLINK "http://www.peostri.army.mil/PM-TRADE/ctia.jsp" http://www.peostri.army.mil/PM-TRADE/ctia.jsp.[11]	Powell, Edward T., Kurt Lessmann, Jason Lucas, and George J.
