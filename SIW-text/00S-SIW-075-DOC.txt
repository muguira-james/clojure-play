It describes the development of a TM-UWB-based tactical engagement system concept and it provides an overview of how this system concept has been simulated to study geopositioning system initialization and performance, terrain mapping, simulation of ballistic munition flyout with terrain interaction, and corresponding real-time casualty assessment (RTCA).1.  Introduction1.1  Motivational ContextExisting tactical engagement simulation systems will not adequately address training problems posed by advanced non-line-of-sight weapon systems currently under development.  For example, laser-based shooter-target pairing systems will not support training with the high explosive area effect munitions of the Objective Individual Combat Weapon (OICW) and the Objective Crew Served Weapon (OCSW).  This "training gap" will be exacerbated as more advanced technologies derived from the U.S. Army's Force XXI and Army After Next initiatives are developed.  The introduction of smart weapons, non-lethal weapons, combatant identification technology, advanced communications, and widely distributed processing will significantly contribute to the obsolescence of existing tactical engagement training systems.1.2  The A-TES STO ProjectThe U.S. Army's Advanced Tactical Engagement Simulation (A-TES) Science and Technology Ob-jective (STO) is a research and development project designed to identify and solve problems associated with live force-on-force training of soldiers in the use of advanced weapon systems.  Specifically, the purpose of the A-TES STO is to identify and develop tactical engagement simulation technologies that will address the potential training gap, allowing training systems to keep pace with future weapon system deployments while meeting the system-level challenges of low cost, portability, and C4I interoperability.  This U.S. Army STRICOM funded project was initiated in FY99 and is expected to culminate in FY02.  Much of what is presented in this paper is covered in more detail in reference [1].1.3  Problem SelectionThe initial focus of the ATES STO has been on training with non-line-of-sight dismounted infantry weapons such as the OICW in urban environments.  This scenario was emphasized because it presents several of the most general problems in their most difficult forms.  Specifically, the non-line-of-sight engagement capability of weapons like the OICW introduces a requirement to perform weapon orien-tation determination with extreme accuracy while urban environments present significant challenges for the technologies that are required to perform simulated munition flyouts, real time casualty assessment, and communication.  These critical technologies include the complex three-dimensional terrain databases that are required to represent urban environments and accurate player geopositioning systems that can function in an environment where GPS systems are particularly ineffective (e.g., inside buildings).  Finally, the wireless communication problems posed by urban environments, particularly by multipath interference, represent challenging communications issues.2.  Technology Assessment2.1  Problem DecompositionIn order to identify the most critical capabilities of a successful A-TES system, the problem of simulating a non-line-of-sight engagement involving an OICW in an urban environment was considered.  All concrete system concepts envisioned by A-TES program personnel involved simulations derived from detailed knowledge of three things:Weapon location and orientation at time of firingLocation and orientation of all potential targetsEnvironment, particularly terrainIt was assumed that any successful system imple-mentation would necessarily require an advanced communication infrastructure, able to support low latency and high bandwidth.Many aspects of the proposed system concepts were common to all of the proposed systems.  These common aspects included:Synthetic environment (including stationary tar-gets)Simulated munition flyout (with or without environment interaction)Simulated munition detonation and fragmentationCasualty assessmentThe immediate goal of identifying the most promising system concept depended upon evaluating those additional characteristics that varied among the concepts.  Assuming the availability of adequate computational power, system concepts could be distinguished primarily on the basis of:Precision of weapon location and orientation at time of firingPrecision of location and orientation of all mobile targetsCapabilities of the communication infrastructureAs described in sections 2.2 and 2.3, these three criteria were used as the basis of technology assessment for the purpose of selecting candidate technologies for further research.  Of these items, weapon orientation errors are likely to be the primary discriminating factor for evaluating relative system performance because small weapon orientation errors produce large munition flyout errors while other factors influencing overall system performance are not magnified in this way.2.2  Assessment of Mature TechnologiesThe following categories of candidate technologies were evaluated with respect to their abilities to determine weapon and player locations and orientations:Range-based geopositioning systems (e.g., GPS-like ranging beacons).Direction-based geopositioning systems (e.g., optical systems detecting infrared beacons).Geopositioning systems based on comparing weapon-mounted video to detailed terrain maps. Environmental orientation sensors (e.g., com-passes, inclinometers, and accelerometers). Inertial sensors (e.g., gyroscopes and acceler-ometers). Range-based geopositioning systems, also called multilateration systems, compute the location of an object from the distances (implied by signal times of arrival) between the object and multiple references with known locations.  By locating more than one point on an object, object orientations may also be determined.  As described in Reference [2], existing range-based geopositioning systems like Differential GPS have two major shortcomings.  First, their measurement errors are at least an order of magnitude greater than what is required to implement an ideal ATES system.  Second, they are particularly ineffective in many battlefield situations (e.g., in dense foliage and inside buildings).Direction-based geopositioning systems have two major shortcomings.  First, due to their reliance on angular measurements, their ability to resolve the location of an object decreases significantly as the range between the object and the references increases.  Second, because they are implemented as optical systems, they require direct lines of sight, implying a very large number of references and severe difficulties operating in the presence of battlefield obscurants or poor weather.Implementing a geopositioning system based upon comparing weapon-mounted video to detailed terrain maps was determined to be impractical for several reasons.  First, it would require extremely precise terrain maps that would be costly and time consuming to generate.  Second, it would be prone to failure as vehicles and other objects moved within the field of play.  Third, it would require either distributed terrain maps or the transfer of large amounts of video data. Fourth, it would require extremely complex image processing algorithms.  Finally, being optically based, this system would not operate in many typical battlefield conditions.As described in Reference [2], compasses and inclinometers are relatively mature environmental sensor technologies that display inconsistent per-formance due to environmental anomalies and are unreliable when they are accelerated.  Under the best of conditions, they have orientation errors that are roughly twice what is considered desirable for an ATES system.As described in reference [2], gyroscopes and accelerometers are relatively mature inertial sensing technologies that experience problems of excessive drift when used to measure locations and orientations.The A-TES project concluded that an adequate A-TES system could not be built relying primarily upon existing mature technologies.2.3  Emerging TM-UWB TechnologyAlthough the A-TES project determined that mature technologies do not hold much promise as the primary basis for an ATES system, the project identified an emerging communications technology that holds great promise for solving the difficult problems related to precise player geopositioning, weapon orientation determination, and data communications.  This emerging technology, referred to as Time Modulated Ultrawideband (TMUWB), is described and docu-mented in references [3] through [10].TM-UWB appears to represent a major breakthrough with respect to each of the critical capabilities identified in section 2.1 as being vital to A-TES success.  Existing prototypes have demonstrated sub-inch point-to-point ranging accuracy, which should allow the development of geopositioning systems with similar accuracy.  This level of accuracy exceeds the A-TES requirements for weapon and player location accuracy.  Technology capability projections strongly suggest that the TM-UWB ranging accuracy will quickly drop below 1 mm as the technology matures enabling weapon orientation accuracy to also exceed A-TES requirements.Since TM-UWB is fundamentally a communication technology, it also directly addresses the third major basis of system comparison.  As documented in references [3] through [10], TM-UWB communi-cations are based upon precisely detecting the time of arrival of discrete pulses.  Compared with traditional frequency modulated technologies, TMUWB com-munications are inherently power efficient, secure, undetectable, non-interfering, and resistant to multipath interference.  They consume very low average power because pulses are only transmitted a small percentage of the time.  They are secure because a pseudo-random jitter is imposed on the timing of the pulses to implement channelization, requiring a synchronized sequence generator to interpret the signal.  Tests have demonstrated that the spectral power density of transmitted signals falls well below the ambient noise floor making it extremely difficult for unauthorized systems to detect the presence of these transmissions.  Due to low power transmission, high channelization, and ultra-wide bandwidth, TMUWB devices require no assigned spectrum, allowing large numbers of these devices to operate in a relatively small area without interfering with existing communications systems.  Finally, transmissions of discrete pulses are relatively immune to multipath interference because reflected pulses do not overlap when path length differences are greater than a meter.  As a result, TM-UWB is more reliable within buildings, in foliage, and in cluttered urban environments.In addition to directly addressing the three primary areas of A-TES concern, commercial market forces and recently successful miniaturization efforts are expected to result in the near-term production of TMUWB devices that are relatively inexpensive, small, and lightweight.  As a result of this analysis, the A-TES project decided to focus its efforts on system designs based upon TM-UWB technology.3.  System Concept Development3.1  System Concept OverviewIn the system concept developed by the A-TES project, TM-UWB devices would be used to implement a multilateration-based geopositioning system (similar in concept to a GPS system using fixed terrestrial references rather than satellites) and a secure wireless network.  The geopositioning system would precisely determine the locations and orientations of weapon systems and potential mobile targets.  The wireless network would communicate this information, as well as information regarding weapon state and time of firing, to a workstation referred to as a "Combat Server."  The Combat Server would use the communicated information and high fidelity terrain data to compute simulated munition flyouts, detonations, fragmentation, and casualty assessment.  Casualty assessment information would be transmitted via the wireless network to affected exercise participants in perceived real time.  Figure 1 illustrates this concept at a high level.Precise knowledge of weapon and player orientations would enable the play of non-line-of-sight weapons firing virtual rounds, which would support training for many weapon systems including OICW, OCSW, mortars, artillery, and armored vehicles.  Using purely simulated (i.e., non-laser based) rounds for actual weapons would introduce the ability to simulate various complex weapon effects, including those of smart weapons.  It would also support the incor-poration of advanced simulation techniques like dynamic terrain effects and allow the introduction of accurately simulated virtual force engagements and mine play.  The increased situational awareness derived from the precise geopositioning system would significantly enhance player safety in training environments that employ live fire and/or realistic pyrotechnic effects.  It would also significantly improve the quality of after action review.Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 1.  A-TES TM-UWB System ConceptThe A-TES non-line-of-sight engagement simulation technique described above could also be applied to simulate direct-fire engagements.  This approach would avoid all of the limitations inherent to laser-based munition fly-outs.  However, it would introduce inaccuracies associated with imperfectly determined weapon locations and orientations.  The accuracy of this approach relative to laser-based systems has yet to be determined.  Unlike laserbased systems, which require line-of-sight between shooter and target, the ATES concept would have to address the issue of ensuring that a path exists between a shooter and a partially obscured target.  However, the A-TES system would have the advantage of being able to account for realistic ballistic effects and would avoid the unrealistic multiple hits that often occur at long range with laser-based systems.3.2  Determining LocationsRange-based geopositioning systems compute the location of an object from the distances between the object and multiple references with known locations.  This technique, called multilateration, is used by GPS systems to determine the location of a GPS receiver from ranges to multiple satellite references.  In the ATES TM-UWB system concept, the reference locations are fixed, as illustrated in Figure 2.Figure 2.  Point GeopositioningFigure 2 represents the general point geopositioning problem in an A-TES context.  In this problem, there is one mobile "target" point and n fixed references.  Clocks associated with the references are synchronized.  In general, the target clock is not synchronized with the reference clocks.Either a ping signal from the target to the references, or a synchronized ping from the references to the target, is transmitted.  The direction of transmission does not affect the mathematics but does influence system architecture as discussed below.  In either case, there are n transmissions and the system knows the delta times of arrival associated with these transmissions.  The mathematics of multilateration are used to solve for the four unknowns which represent the three dimensional location of the target plus one target-reference synchronization degree of freedom.Because locations are computed from signal delta times of arrival, synchronization of the references is particularly important.  The A-TES approach to synchronizing references involves having all ref-erences maintain communication lock on a master clock signal, then adjusting the time perceived by each reference based upon the known distance from the reference to the source of the signal.Early A-TES simulations clearly demonstrated that small range errors could result in significant location errors unless reference point geometry was carefully chosen.  Specifically, references must be located so that they have relatively orthogonal directions with respect to potential target locations.  Given this knowledge, there are a variety of simple schemes for ensuring adequate reference geometries.Although relatively few references are required to obtain mathematical solutions to the geopositioning problem posed above, there are significant advantages to using additional references.  For example, addi-tional references:Help assure good reference point geometryOverspecify the problem which tends to result in a more accurate solutionAllow solutions when some signals aren't receivedDesensitize the solution to slight reference motionsChanging the number of references has broad implications for the system architecture, so estimating the optimal number of references for any given scenario is a task that is well suited to simulation-based approaches.Although, as stated above, a "pinging target" archi-tecture is mathematically equivalent to a "pinging references" architecture, the direction of ping trans-mission significantly impacts the system architecture by affecting where critical data is available.  If mobile targets ping fixed references, it is relatively easy to guarantee that pings occur at times of interest (e.g., at the time of weapon fire) and, for this reason, less frequent pings may be required.  However, in this case, a potential bottleneck associated with reference communications significantly limits system scalability.  The references must be capable of listening for signals from all of the targets and, as ping signals arrive at references, the signal times of arrival must be transmitted to some central location for geopositioning processing.  At some point, the number of targets will not be able to be increased without overwhelming the reference communication system.  If fixed references ping mobile targets, this potential bottleneck is eliminated.  Without additional communication, the delta times of signal arrival are available to the mobile targets allowing them to compute their own locations.  By distributing geopositioning processing in this way, a virtually unlimited number of targets may be accommodated.  In addition, this architecture allows more advanced target instrumentation to be deployed as it is developed (e.g., the human body geopositioning systems discussed in section 3.3) without altering the fixed references that constitute the range instru-mentation.  For these reasons, the A-TES concept system uses a "pinging references" architecture.3.3  Determining OrientationsBy locating more than one target point on an object, object orientations may also be determined.  By placing at least 3 target points on a rigid body (e.g., a weapon), we may solve for the rigid body's full set of 6 degrees of freedom (i.e., its three dimensional location and three dimensional orientation).  This concept is illustrated in Figure 3.Figure 3.  Rigid Body GeopositioningIn rigid body geopositioning, there are m fixed target points on a mobile rigid body and there are n fixed reference points.  Clocks associated with the references are synchronized.  In general, clocks associated with the target points are synchronized with each other but not with the reference clocks.Either a synchronized ping signal from the target points to the references, or a synchronized ping from the references to the target points, is transmitted.  Again, the direction of transmission does not affect the mathematics but does influence system architecture.  In either case, there are mxn transmissions and the system knows the delta times of arrival associated with these transmissions.One approach to solving this problem is to individually locate the three target points using point multilateration, then determine the rigid body's location and orientation from the target point locations.  This approach results in mxn equations in 3m+1 unknowns; the unknowns represent the three dimensional locations of the m target points plus one target-reference synchronization degree of freedom.  A mathematically superior approach developed by the ATES program involves enforcing the constraints implied by the fixed locations of the target points with respect to the rigid body as part of a more general multilateration solution.  Introducing rigid body constraints in this way allows the 3m location degrees of freedom to be transformed into 6 rigid body degrees of freedom, resulting in mxn equations in only 7 unknowns.  Rigid body geopositioning accuracy may be decomposed into location accuracy and orientation accuracy.  Because weapon orientation errors are amplified by munition flyout while location errors are not, weapon orientation accuracy will have a much greater influence on overall A-TES system per-formance.  This fact may be exploited by hardware that is customized to perform rigid body geopositioning.  Consider how the target points on a rigid body process one ping from one reference.  If the time of arrival errors associated with each of the target points are identical, then there is no corresponding rigid body orientation error.  This desirable situation is illustrated in Figure 4.Figure 4.  Identical Time of Arrival Errors ProduceNo Orientation ErrorA rigid body-specific geopositioning system could be designed to produce time of arrival errors that were highly correlated in this way by connecting multiple TM-UWB antennas to a single processor.  Such a device could use interferometric techniques to more accurately determine the delta times of arrivals that determine rigid body orientation.  A geopositioning system customized in this way would have several other significant benefits.  Specifically, it would:Reduce communication requirements by locali-zing all of the data required for rigid body geopositioningProvide an appropriate place to deploy specialized rigid body geopositioning algorithmsLower power consumption due to the reduction in the number of processorsRegardless of which technique is used to perform rigid body geopositioning, because the human body may be modeled as an articulated structure composed of rigid bodies, it is conceptually straightforward to extend the concepts introduced above to measure a substantial portion of the range of human motion.  For example, torso motion could be well characterized using one target point at each shoulder and one at the waist; this concept is currently employed in the A-TES simulation described in section 4.  Eight more targets would be required to capture the gross motor activity of the limbs and three additional targets would be required to completely capture head motion.  Tracking player motions in this level of detail would allow casualty assessment simulations to be extremely accurate, fully accounting for player shielding and orientation relative to detonations.4.  Simulation Development4.1  Simulation OverviewEarly A-TES simulations focused on the implemen-tation and validation of multilateration algorithms and the characterization of levels of multilateration range errors that would produce OICW high explosive burst point dispersion patterns that roughly matched the dispersion characteristics of actual rounds.  In anticipation of TM-UWB hardware availability, a more comprehensive simulation was conceived as a precursor to a Hardware-In-The-Loop (HWIL) de-monstration.  The objectives of this HWIL-precursor simulation were to:Develop a complete HWIL demonstration concept.Design and implement reusable software modules for all aspects of the demonstration.Ensure the use of scalable designs.The following simulation requirements were derived from perceived HWIL demonstration requirements:System portability and auto-initializationSimple terrain mapping capabilityGeopositioning of multiple playersWireless networking to support geopositioning-related communicationIndirect fire engagements with statistical real-time casualty assessmentReal-time 2D plan view visualization of player positions and engagementsIn addition, the simulation requires representations of live players, weapon hardware, and TMUWB hardware.The simulation was designed to represent a HWIL demonstration with up to 18 TM-UWB devices distributed as follows:Control workstation with 1 TM-UWB device for wireless network access1 weapon with 3 TM-UWB devices2 players with 3 TM-UWB devices eachReference array with 8 TM-UWB devicesThis exercise scope was intended to support a mobile HWIL demonstration anywhere with simple terrain (e.g., conference rooms or NAWC-TSD Lab).After an extensive evaluation of potential simulation environments, the A-TES program selected a simulation software package named OMNeT++.  OMNeT++ is an open source, C++-based simulation environment available at http://www.hit.bme.hu/phd/ vargaa/omnetpp.htm.  It is supported by AndrÃ¡s Varga, a professor at Technical University of Budapest.  The criteria used for the evaluation are documented in referenceÂ [11].  OMNeT++ has performed extremely well in support of the A-TES simulations.4.2  Simulation ArchitectureFigure 5 illustrates a high level overview of the architecture selected for the simulated HWIL demonstration.  Note that the Java-based simulation GUI is implemented separately from the C++ simulation.  Figure 6 illustrates the relationships among the simulated objects.                 Figure 5.  Architecture of Simulated HWIL DemonstrationFigure 6.  Simulation Object RelationshipsBecause this simulation must accurately represent signal arrival times on the order of picoseconds and span a total run time of many seconds, it must be implemented using a "discrete event" simulation engine.  Discrete event simulators run at a rate that is appropriate for the simulation but has nothing to do with wall clock time.  Therefore, the primary purpose of the inputProcessor and outputProcessor objects shown in Figure 6 are to act as timers that throttle down the speed of the simulation engine to allow it to interact with external systems (e.g., the simulation GUI) at regular intervals that correspond to wall clock time.The TM-UWB wireless network is composed of the wirelessNetwork object, the accessDevice, 8 refer-ences, and 9 mobile devices.  The primary purpose of the wirelessNetwork object is to ensure that all wireless messages get delivered at a time determined by the inter-device distances and the signal propagation rate.The objectTracker object tracks the locations of the mobile TM-UWB devices as reported by the accessDevice.  From these locations, it computes the locations and orientations of the players and weapon.  The terrainMap object stores the terrain map.  In response to weapon events, the weaponEventProcessor consults the objectTracker and the terrainMap to determine munition interactions with players or terrain.4.3  Scripted BehaviorsIn the simulation, position scripts are used to specify the ground truth location and orientation of simulated physical objects over the period of time associated with an exercise.  These scripts are high-level C++ objects that interpolate between time points to provide positions at any time within the script history.  Position script data files were generated manually for the players and the weapon.  The weapon script data was specified relative to the shooter player script.  Other scripts and data files were used to define: Fixed location of the TM-UWB network access device.Fixed locations of the TM-UWB reference devices.Fixed locations of the mobile TM-UWB devices relative to the players and weapon.Path taken by TM-UWB "mapping device" during pre-exercise activities such as terrain mapping.TM-UWB hardware device IDs.4.4  TM-UWB System InitializationTM-UWB system initialization is simulated as follows.  On power up, the TM-UWB network access device waits for a command from the control workstation and the other TM-UWB devices wait for a command from the network access device.  In response to a user command to initialize the system, a "network map" is propagated outward from the network access device to all other TM-UWB devices using a series of broadcast messages.  From the network map, each device learns whether it's a reference or a mobile device based on its hardware ID.  This flexible network map-based design allows the system to be rapidly configured for any combination of references and mobile devices.Next, the network access device and the references synchronize with each other and perform the inter-reference ranging that is required for geopositioning.  This procedure requires a bi-directional handshake between all pairs of stationary devices.  To avoid chaos in the as yet uninitialized communication system, the handshakes take place within time slots that are prearranged on the basis of device IDs.The network access device then derives a geopo-sitioning coordinate system from the inter-reference ranges and it determines the reference locations with respect to this reference system.  The resulting reference locations are communicated to the mobile devices and continuous geopositioning processing is initiated.4.5  Geopositioning ProcessingContinuous geopositioning processing is simulated as follows:  Synchronized reference devices repeatedly broadcast coordinated ping signals.  The wireless network simulation computes ping signal propagation times based upon the inter-device distances, which are determined by the various scripts described in sectionÂ 4.3.After receiving the properly timed messages, the mobile devices use the known reference device locations and times of ping signal arrival to compute their locations using point multilateration.  The mobile devices regularly communicate their locations to the simulation workstation through the wireless network.  After geopositioning processing has been initiated, the simulation workstation begins communicating the mobile device locations to the visualization systems.4.6  Terrain MappingAfter geopositioning processing has been initiated, the user interacts with a GUI dialog to identify a mobile TMUWB device that will be used to survey terrain features.  This device is referred to as the "mapping device".  As the mapping device reaches each location to be surveyed (as determined by the appropriate script), the user interacts with a simple terrain editor to construct a terrain map of the exercise area.4.7  Identification of High Level ObjectsThe user interacts with GUI dialogs to associate TMUWB devices with the players and the weapon.  After this has been done, the simulation workstation computes high-level object locations and orientations from the individual device locations.  This data is forwarded to the visualization systems for display.4.8  Weapon Event Processing and Real Time Casualty AssessmentWeapon events (laser ranging, range adjustment, and firing) are also determined by GUI events.  The results of weapon events are computed by the simulation workstation.  Tracked weapon location and orientation are used to compute laser "flyout."  Tracked weapon location, orientation, and range setting are used to compute munition flyout and detonation.  In all cases, the terrain map is consulted to assess obstruction by terrain features and the player locations are used to assess obstruction by players.  Real-time casualty assessment is then performed for all weapon firing events.4.9  GUI ScreenshotA representative simulation GUI screenshot is presented in Figure 7.  In this screenshot, terrain features representing walls are evident, the references appear as black dots, the large circle represents the current range setting of the weapon, the straight red line represents a munition flyout, the small solid red circle indicates a detonation, and the red color of the player near the detonation indicates a casualty.Figure 7.  Simulation GUI Screenshot4.10  Directions for Future WorkPotential enhancements to the A-TES simulation include:Addition of a 3D visualization capability.Improvements to the fidelity of the TM-UWB simulation to include the modeling of propagation errors and synchronization drift and correction.Addition of TM-UWB system health monitoring.Integration of real TM-UWB hardware.Ability to map more complex terrain.Improvements to non-geopositioning wireless network capability.5.  SummaryExisting tactical engagement simulation systems will not adequately address training problems posed by advanced non-line-of-sight weapon systems currently under development.  By analyzing one of the most challenging problems associated with advanced tactical engagement simulation, live training with non-line-of-sight dismounted infantry weapons such as the OICW in urban environments, the A-TES project identified the following three vital capabilities which could be used to evaluate the relative viability of candidate ATES technologies:Precision of weapon location and orientation at time of firingPrecision of location and orientation of all mobile targetsCapabilities of the communication infrastructureThe A-TES project evaluated mature technologies relative to these vital capabilities and found them to be inadequate as the primary basis of an A-TES system.  However, the emerging TM-UWB technology appears to represent a major breakthrough in all of these critical capabilities.TM-UWB prototypes have demonstrated a point-to-point ranging accuracy that implies that this technology will exceed ATES location accuracy requirements.  No mature technology is remotely close to meeting these requirements.  Furthermore, the current devel-opment track for TM-UWB technology implies that it will soon be capable of meeting the more stringent ATES orientation accuracy requirements.  Therefore, it is difficult to envision a successful ATES system that does not employ TMUWB technology for geopositioning purposes.  When the fact that TM-UWB is inherently a robust, stealthy communications technology is also considered, this technology appears to be the obvious choice as the underlying technology of future A-TES systems.Although significant engineering development will be required to field an A-TES system based upon this emerging technology, the existing A-TES simulation serves as a compelling proof of concept.  The A-TES project will use this simulation to further explore architectural and performance issues.  In the very near future, the integration of TM-UWB hardware proto-types will begin, allowing simulation assumptions to be validated.ReferencesSPARTA, Inc.: "A-TES STO Phase 1 Final Re-port", Nov. 1999.Southwest Research Institute: "Alternate Methods for Geometric Pairing for Direct and Indirect Fire Simulation for Tactical Engagement Simulation for Test, Evaluation, and Training, Technology Assessment Final Report", N0060-97-D-2733, Dec. 30, 1998.U.S. Army CECOM RDEC: "Test Report for Feasibility Demonstration of Ultra Wideband Digital Radio", Aug. 15, 1994.T.
