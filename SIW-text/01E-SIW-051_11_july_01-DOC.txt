The Joint Warfare System (JWARS) is a multi-sided constructive simulation of joint theater warfare at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels with focus on the operational level. JWARS is approaching Release 1 for use by US military analysis agencies for Force Assessment and will replace the functionality of the TACWAR and MIDAS simulations. Future releases will replace the other theater level analytic models now in use for Planning and Execution analysis, System Effectiveness and Trade-off Analysis, and Concept and Doctrine Development and Assessment within the US DoD. During the conduct of the JWARS V&V Program the V&V Agent has made frequent use of both the initial 1996 version of the RPG and the updated version that is currently being completed.  DMSO’s VV&A RPG has proven to be an effective resource for VV&A practitioners in the planning and execution of a VV&A program.The VV&A Recommended Practices GuideThe DoD Instruction 5000.61 (DoDI 5000.61) and DoD VV&A Recommended Practices Guide (RPG) serve as the cornerstones of DoD VV&A policy and guidance.DoDI 5000.61establishes common terminology and defines high level roles and responsibilities, while the RPG defines underlying philosophy, principles, and methodologies recommended for use in DoD VV&A efforts.  These documents have been used to support the evolution of  Service policy and guidance and have been a motivating force in the increased emphasis on VV&A issues.  The RPG provides core VV&A reference material that has been adopted and adapted by numerous development programs within the DoD, to include JSIMS, JWARS, JADS, and NETWARS.  The preliminary version of the RPG provided an excellent tutorial on the subject matter.  However, as time progressed the community began to request more detailed treatments of the subject material as well as in-depth assessments of related technical problems (e.g., conceptual models, fidelity).Between 1996 and 1998, the DoD VV&A Technical Working Group (TWG) solicited feedback from the DoD community to determine appropriate ways to increase the utility of the RPG. Recommendations included providing more technical detail, addressing a broader audience, and making it easier to find information.  An effort was initiated to revise the RPG based on reader feedback.  The result is the RPG, the Year 2000 Edition. The objectives of the Year 2000 Edition are 3-fold:First, account for the diversity of audience by tailoring explanations and providing role-specific guidance.Second, account for the diversity of situations by tailoring procedures and providing context-specific guidance.Third, focus on the practical instead of the theoretical.Based on the objectives, the vision for the Year 2000 Edition is a multi-tiered, multi-dimensional document that is non-linear and reader-based.  The approach to implement the vision evolved into a web-based document.  Information would be provided for 5 different functional perspectives addressing 3 different simulation categories (See Figure 1 – matrix ).  The document structure would consist of multiple layers of information.   EMBED PowerPoint.Slide.8  Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 1 RPG 2000 MatrixThe advantages of this approach are important:  it allows greater breadth and depth to the document; it facilitates the addition of information over time; and it empowers the reader to locate pertinent information.  EMBED PowerPoint.Slide.8  Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 2  VV&A RPG 2000 Site MapFigure 2 depicts the RPG site map (the entry page for the RPG is at http://www.msiac.dmso.mil/vva/).  The pyramid illustrates the RPG’s information layers. Each succeeding layer provides an increasing level of detail.  The Key Concepts impart an understanding of the fundamental issues related to VV&A.  The Core documents (defined by the matrix seen in Figure 1) talk to the impacts, challenges, and functional tasks as seen from as specific perspective.  Special topics papers address topical issues central to VV&A such as subject matter experts, risk management, & conceptual models. Reference papers are in-depth technical discussions for the reader seeking more specifics in a given area.  While the depth of the RPG is illustrated in the increasing levels of detail in the pyramid, the breadth is evidenced in the 15 core documents that combine each of the 5 functional roles with one of the 3 categories of simulation.  The development of the Year 2000 edition mirrors many of the concepts defined in a robust VV&A process.  Requirements were defined and verified through meetings of the VV&A Technical Working Group.  A team of recognized experts and practitioners (Subject Matter Experts or SMEs) were assembled.  It was decided that the Year 2000 edition would be released in three builds.  Build 1focuses on new modeling and simulation (M&S) development efforts (Building from scratch).  Build 2 will focus on legacy M&S.Build 3 will focus on M&S federations.An Alpha version was released in late 1999 to assess the viability of the web-based concept (e.g., down-load time, browser differences, etc.).  Phase I Beta (focused on Build 1) was released in March 2000. A review team of  two dozen experts in the Services, government agencies, industry and academia was assembled and a review was conducted. Reviewers were asked to look for consistency across the documents as well as any holes in information content.  Review comments were tracked and individually addressed.  Results of the review and the associated resolution were presented to the VV&A Technical Working Group.  This group gave the “thumbs-up” for release of Build 1 that was unveiled at DMSO Industry Days in May of 2000.  Phase II Beta is currently being completed.  2. The Joint Warfare System (JWARS)The Joint Warfare System (JWARS) is currently under development in the United States by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the Joint Staff.  The JWARS Office is managed by the Director, Program Analysis & Evaluation in OSD.  JWARS will be a closed-form simulation of joint, campaign-level warfare simulation that will support analysis requirements throughout DoD.  Future JWARS users include:  the US Joint Staff, regional military commanders, industry, OSD, military Joint Task Forces, and the US military Services.  JWARS intended uses include:  force assessment; planning and execution support; system effectiveness and trade off analysis; and, concept and doctrine development and assessment.JWARS is currently being prepared for Release 1, Limited IOC, in 2002 to replace the current TACWAR simulation for force assessment.3. The JWARS V&V ProgramThe JWARS Office Director’s guidance at the beginning of the V&V process was to use the DoD VV&A RPG as the primary reference for the process and the report formats. In accordance with the RPG the V&V Agent attempted to develop a process that provided maximum value added to the JWARS effort by supporting development risk reduction.  When the initial JWARS V&V Oversight group was formed it began the process of using V&V Agent’s recommendations based on the RPG as the basis for the planned JWARS V&V process.  The Oversight Group, made up of JWARS developers, V&V experts from DMSO, representatives from the Service analytic agencies, and the V&V Agent developed the tailored JWARS V&V process shown in Figure 3.  3.1 The JWARS V&V processThe V&V Agent based the suggested V&V processes entirely on the RPG and began the process of determining what the Oversight Group believed should be done from the suggested list of processes given the time and resources available.  From this discussion process the initial JWARS V&V process was defined.Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 3  JWARS V&V ProcessThe process includes verification and validation of the pre-design artifacts including the Joint Application Design Packages (JADs) and the JWARS Conceptual Model of the Mission Space (CMMS).  Most of this effort involved validation by warfare SMEs and there was limited verification for format and content.  The effort then focused on design verification (both high-level and detailed designs) and Results Validation.  Although this process was tailored to the JWARS software development process, it was entirely based on the RPG and the techniques suggested in the RPG.The JWARS V&V PlanThe V&V process developed by the Oversight Group based on the RPG provided the basis for the subsequent JWARS V&V Plan.  Using the DoD VV&A RPG as a guide, the group developed a tailored JWARS V&V Plan within the constraints of the JWARS Program Manager’s guidance.  The V&V Oversight Group provided the coordination and approval for the plan and continued to meet to address V&V and other issues.  The group later was renamed the JWARS V&V-T&E Working Integrated Product Team (WIPT).   The JWARS V&V Plan is available online at  HYPERLINK "https://www.jointmodels.mil" https://www.jointmodels.mil and JWARS V&V-T&E WIPT information is available from the JWARS Office.In order to make changes required to address modifications in the JWARS software development process changes in JWARS V&V processes have been captured in a JWARS V&V Process Description document.  In order to avoid frequent updates to the JWARS V&V Plan this companion JWARS V&V Procedures document was developed.  In this document the detailed current processes are fully described and detailed.  Much of the effort to keep the processes current and provide the maximum risk reduction benefit has been based on the updated RPG as it has been available.  The V&V Agent team closely follows the RPG update process and takes advantage of added detail to include it in the JWARS V&V procedures.  In addition, the JWARS V&V team provides lessons learned back to the RPG writing effort for possible inclusion in the lessons learned sections and examples of the updated RPG.SummaryBy using the DoD VV&A RPG (both the 1996 version and the updated 2000 version) as a primary reference the JWARS V&V program has been able to achieve many of the development risk reduction goals of the effort.  The RPG provided an authoritative source that the Oversight Group and the V&V Agent used for JWARS V&V planning and plan execution.  By having the RPG as a reference, the JWARS V&V Agent was able to avoid contention with the Joint Analytic Modeling Improvement Program (JAMIP) Steering Committee (the primary senior DoD management for the JWARS simulation development, V&V and operational testing) about what V&V processes to conduct and how to conduct them.  The RPG also provided a good source of what and how to report from the V&V effort.  Had the RPG not been available, the JWARS V&V Agent would have spent significantly more time and resources on research of V&V techniques and procedures rather than conducting the V&V effort.  The updated RPG is also providing improved V&V procedures and techniques that are being added to the JWARS V&V effort.5. References[1]  Defense Modeling and Simulation Office, 1996.
