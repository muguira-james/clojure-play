Distribute Simulation Processes and Tools ForumChairJake BorahVice ChairJane BachmanSecretaryPhil MoulObjectives for this Workshop: discussprocess for developing distributed simulationstools for developing distributed simulationsexercise planning and managementand Recommendations Presentation from Comments:Paper 04S-SIW-033 Author Request: SISO formalize a group to define and standardize the data replay synchronization protocol. DSPT officers explained procedure for creating an SG. Action for DSPT: email will be posted to DSPT reflector inviting interested forum members to contact paper author.Paper 04S-SIW-101 Author advocated correction of OMT specification deficiencies through use of DAML/OWL. DSPT Recommendation: Author provide feedback to OMT standard group for evolution of 1516 OMT standard.Paper 04S-SIW-037 Paper raises awareness of security issues in HLA federations and recommends three-tier defense against attacks. DSPT Recommendation: paper provides an analysis of potential threats and solutions.Paper 04S-SIW-065 Author seeking feedback on standards that address composability from possibly related SISO work (SRML, RPR-FOM, BOM). DSPT Recommendation: elicit feedback through use of DSPT reflector.Paper 04S-SIW-137 Author presented updates on 1516 version of federation compliance testing process and federation verification tool. DSPT Recommendation: use DSPT reflector to keep forum members updated on availability of DMSO-sponsored 1516 tools and processes.Paper 04S-SIW-012 Author recommended open data interchange format (XML) is potentially useful product for SISO adoption. Work sponsored by international consortium, looking for home. DSPT Action: use DSPT reflector to provide URL ( HYPERLINK "http://www.euclid1113.com" www.euclid1113.com) to inform community of study results (SEDEP).Paper 04S-SIW-056 DSPT Action: DSPT will post to reflector author contact information if anyone needs follow-up information on topic.Paper 04S-SIW-111 Author Request: SISO should promote Patterns as a key part of M&S analysis. DSPT Action: DSPT will post request on reflector and elicit feedback.General RecommendationsDSPT Action: DSPT will utilize reflector better and more frequently to post news and solicit actions.DSPT Warning: SISO members need to be aware of potential problems as new concepts are developed with multiple parties using similar terminology in vastly different ways.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)40Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)50Peak attendance (including joint sessions)N/ATotal papers presented11“No-show” presentations0Other presentations and panel discussions0Recommended Reading List nominations (including previous nominations):04S-SIW-039 (already nominated for SIWzie)04S-SIW-056 (already nominated for SIWzie)04S-SIW-111 (already nominated for SIWzie)
