Rules have been developed over the years that enable military planners and operators to relate environmental parameters to weapons system performance.  The DoD Air and Space Natural Environment Executive Agent developed the Advanced Climate Modeling and Environmental Simulations (ACMES) program to produce high resolution gridded data for use in generating high resolution climate statistics from simulated weather observations at any desired location around the world.  It is intended that data from the ACMES effort could be used by commanders to assess the environmental effects on operations. In addition, a tool has been developed by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) to enable operators to assess the impact of environmental factors on the performance of military systems, subsystems, and components.  The ARL system, the Integrated Weather Effects Decision Aid (IWEDA), takes weather and environmental data and compares them to a set of rules that relate environmental parameters to weapons system performance.  The results from the IWEDA system can enable operators to identify regions and time periods when weapons system performance may be “marginal” or “unfavorable.”This paper describes a system that has been developed to provide environmental tactical decision aid support to the warfighter based on high-resolution historical data from ACMES and rules based on the IWEDA concept.  The results from this system are high resolution, gridded values of weapons performance statistics that can be used to support the mission planning cycle.  These results can be expressed in terms of the context of individual mission tasks and phasing.THE CHALLENGEThe impact of weather on military operations was visibly demonstrated in the recent air campaign in the Balkans where Allied air operations were often limited by weather conditions. The challenge to the weather provider community is not only to provide accurate and timely weather data products to the operators, but also to provide data products that can relate the impact of the weather on systems performance. These systems performance products need to be produced for long-term planning purposes as well as for more immediate mission planning and rehearsal activities. Finally, these products must be easy to customize to reflect different weapons systems configurations and mission profiles. The Weather Effects for the Warfighter (WxFX) program was developed to meet this challenge, leveraging the existing set of weather effects rules that underlie the Army's IWEDA system.  The basic set of Army rules has been augmented with a set of rules for Air Force platforms that was developed to support the JWARS program.THE APPROACHThe WxFX system runs on a PC platform running Windows. The graphical interface system and primary analysis software are written in Java. The WxFX system also includes the GeoViewer, a government-owned object-oriented geographical information system developed by Argonne National Laboratory. The WxFX proof-of-concept system uses high-resolution historical weather data from the ACMES system to drive the system performance evaluation. In addition, the WxFX system can also input current forecast data from weather models, such as MM5, to perform analyses for immediate mission planning. The system performance evaluation is performed by evaluating environmental parameters against a set of rules that have been developed and validated by subject-matter experts, that rate the performance of the user-selected weapons systems in terms of “favorable,” “marginal,” or “unfavorable” conditions. The rules are associated with different kinds of mission operations performed by different military systems and their subsystems and components. In addition to being able to use historical data, the WxFX system can also be applied against forecast weather data to assess system performance against “tomorrow's weather.”To perform an analysis, the user first selects the geographic region of interest or a subset of the region for analysis.  In the proof-of-concept WxFX system, ACMES data for Korea and the Balkans were used.  Recently, ACMES data were produced over the southwestern U.S. to support the use of WxFX in the Joint Expeditionary Force Experiments (JEFX).After the region has been selected, the user selects the time period to analyze (years, seasons or months, and hours of the day) using the options shown in Figure 1 (a.). Next, the systems to be studied are chosen, using the options in the graphical interface system shown in Figure 1 (b.). Systems are represented with associated subsystems, which can in turn include a set of components.When selecting systems, a note about the environmental factors that can potentially impact a system is shown in a dialog box at the bottom of Figure 1 (b.). The user can construct a force package with a specific mix of assets or look at specific systems in different configurations, such as a C-130 for personnel and equipment insertions. This flexibility to “pick and choose” gives the WxFX system the ability to be tailored to the specific needs of the analyst or mission planner.The WxFX system performance products can be visualized and analyzed in a variety of user-controlled methods. For example, one can select a high-level “big picture” view over all times and locations or produce a “spatial view” of system performance for a given time period.  In both cases, one can “drill down” into the analysis to find out which specific rules were triggered and at what frequency.Examples of the kinds of output products available from the WxFX system are shown in Figures 2 and 3. The examples in the figures were based on an analysis of ACMES data for Korea for the years 1976 - 1978. Figure 2 is an example of the “high-level” system performance results available from the WxFX system. In the example, the performance summaries are for components associated with “Personnel” systems in January.  The WxFX system allows the user to “drill down” into the rules base to see the specific rules that were fired by the environmental conditions.  In the example in Figure 2, the system lists those rules associated with “Night Vision Goggles.”Figure 3 shows a spatial display of system performance over Korea. The spatial display shows the lowest level of performance found at each location over Korea. The display shows the spatial variation in the performance of the “Personnel” system for 0Z for all three years of the Korean ACMES data.  (a.)

A spatial view of the performance of the “Personnel” system over Korea for 0Z January. The data are expressed in terms of areas of “favorable,” “marginal,” or “unfavorable” performance.The display of the “worst case” of performance can be based on the occurrence of at least one value of a given level of performance or it can be based on a set of user-defined thresholds.  In the example shown in Figure 3, thresholds were set for defining what constitutes areas of “unfavorable” or “marginal” performance.  For a location to be labeled “unfavorable” performance, the system performance had to be “unfavorable” at least 25% of the time.  If it was not, the performance was checked to see if it was “marginal” at least 40% of the time.  If it was, the performance was termed “marginal”; otherwise, it was termed favorable. The WxFX system also can provide spatial displays of the probability of occurrences of the individual areas of “favorable,” “marginal,” or “unfavorable” performance, thereby giving a more realistic evaluation of the feasibility of an operation.THE IMPORTANCE OF MISSION CONTEXTThe original IWEDA system that WxFX was based on analyzes the impact of environmental factors based on a set of rules that do not take into consideration if it “makes sense” for that rule to be fired at a given location.  Expressed another way, the original IWEDA rules do not have the ability to incorporate the context of the mission for which the analysis is being performed.Being able to incorporate mission context into an analysis is an important requirement for the WxFX program. The reason is that analysis with mission context included may give a false impression of the real environmental impacts on a military system.  The importance of mission context can be demonstrated by two examples, shown in Figures 4 and 5.Figure 4 shows an analysis of the performance of the F-117A against data for an area encompassing the countries of the former Yugoslavia.  The analysis shown in Figure 4 implies considerable unfavorable performance of the aircraft over the Balkans.  However, after one drills down into the data to examine what specific rules have fired, one discovers that the rules leading to the unfavorable performance related entirely to the impact of weather conditions during engine startup.  When this is factored into the analysis, the areas of unfavorable performance over the Balkans, which would represent areas of flight operations, would turn to areas of favorable performance.Figure 4. An example of WxFX results displaying the system performance of a F-117A based on weather conditions over the former Yugoslavia.  The results imply unfavorable performance for the F-117A over the Balkans area, but the rules that triggered the unfavorable performance only relate to conditions impacting the starting of the aircraft engine while on the ground.  As a result, the true performance of the F-117A over the operational area when the mission context of the rules is taken into account becomes favorable.Figure 5 shows results from a WxFX analysis that was generated in support of the Joint Expeditionary Force Experiments (JEFX) that took place during the summer of 2000. The example shown in Figure 5 is a spatial view of personnel performance at 0000Z in July over the JEFX study area, the western United States.  The analysis involved three years of ACMES data.The analysis shows a considerable area of “unfavorable” performance off the West Coast.  Many of the rules related to personnel performance involve mission functions which would logically only take place over land, such as a ground forward observer. However, the basic structure of the original IWEDA rules does not take into account the type of the underlying surface or whether or not a given rule would “logically” be associated with a certain type of surface (i.e. land or water.)ADDING MISSION CONTEXT TO A WxFX ANALYSISIn order to enable a WxFX analysis to capture mission context, two basic enhancements are being made to the system. The first is that each analysis will include data that describes the nature of the surface at each grid point.  Initially, these data will only include a land/water flag and the elevation, but it is intended to expand the data to include surface characteristics (e.g. urban, rural, forest, etc.) that could be used in physics-based applications.  The second enhancement will involve the development of a set of tools that would permit the user to identify where specific mission functions might occur in an area of operations and the time periods for when those mission functions might occur.   The database of rules will be modified to allow the checking of surface type (and characteristics) for those rules that have a logical relationship to a given type of surface.  Then, only those rules associated with a given surface type will be fired, thereby giving a more accurate assessment of system performance.The rules that have been developed to describe system performance can also be logically divided into two types of rules - those related to mission phases and those related to the engineering performance of a system. The rules related to mission phases can be described in terms of phases, such as maintenance, fueling, takeoffs/landings, and target/landing zone/drop zone identification. The rules tied to engineering performance can be described in terms of platform types, such as rotary wing airframe, fixed wing fighter airframe, fixed wing combat airlift airframe, and ground platform.  With these mission context extractions of the rules, one could then identify locations within the area of operations where these mission functions would occur. Then, during an analysis only those rules associated with the designated mission phases would be analyzed.FUTURE ENHANCEMENTSA long-term goal of the WxFX effort is to transition the software to an operational system that could be used by planning staffs for use in mission planning as well as mission rehearsal. Plans have also been developed to provide the ability to assess system performance using physics-based rules rather than the more empirically derived rules that are now utilized. ACKNOWLEDGMENTThis work is sponsored by the U.
