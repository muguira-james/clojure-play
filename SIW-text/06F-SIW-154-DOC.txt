Name of Forum or Group:  C2 M&S ServicesChairJohn DalyVice ChairAndreas TolkSecretaryTom MullinsObjectives for this Workshop:Provide awareness to the C2/M&S Services community on the changes at DMSO and orientation towards functional communities using M&S.Provide awareness and information on DoD Training COI in the M&S COI.Provide greater awareness of ontology efforts in the C2/M&S Services community.Share ongoing efforts in implementation of ontology and grammar in C2/M&SDiscuss current efforts within DARPA, TRADOC, and PEO STRI for linking M&S and C2 systems Support Product Development Groups affiliated with C2 M&S Services Comments and Recommendations:There was continued and ongoing interest in ontology, grammar, and other data attribution schemas in the forumThere was great interest in Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) implementation in the DoD GIG and the architectural frameworks to support thisThere was considerable interest in mixing HLA federations and web services in hybrid architectures to support training and decision support in C2 SOA migrationOverarching approaches enabling heterogeneity without loosing interoperability are required, first ideas were presentedRecommend:That the Spring 07 Call for papers be revised to include: “of particular interest are papers that deal with Global Information Grid (GIG) Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) services instantiations and deployment, the architectural frameworks that can be utilized, such as the DoD Architecture Framework (DoDAF) or the Ministry of Defense Architecture Framework (MoDAF), the design and implementation of these services, the infrastructure to support them, and their ability to interoperate with various, international, ad-hoc coalitions.”That the C2/M&S Services forum plans to invite presentations by current GIG implementers with the emphasis on lessons learned from implementation of SOAs.That the C2/M&S services forum plans to invite two or three architecture framework practitioners for a discussion on how to implement a SOA utilizing these frameworks.That the SISO consider a shift from a Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization, to a Services Interoperability Standards Organization reflecting:The change from a dedicated Simulation community with its own users and architecture to a provider of advanced application services in a diverse and federated SOA environment.The rise of SOA based mixed use networks and capabilities (e.g., DoD GIG, etc.)The need for some standards-based guidance in federating M&S based SOA services with each other and with other types of Information Technology (IT) capabilities in near-real time (e.g., C2, business, logistics systems, etc.)To best use the wealth of intellectual capitol SISO represents – in support of new the IT that require a unique set of M&S knowledge and experience – to implementing SOA type capabilities in and outside the traditional M&S community, SISO should open its doors to other communities outside of M&S.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)42Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)62Peak attendance (including joint sessions)48Total papers presented18“No-show” presentationsn/aOther presentations and panel discussions3Recommended Reading List nomination: 06F-SIW-114 for showing the way to common initialization standard requirements (MSDL)06F-SIW-008 for contributions to ontological spectrum applicability (C-BML)06F-SIW-036 for forum-overarching application of servicesPaper 114 is the most appropriate C2 M&S paper, but of special C2 interest.  The contributions of 008 and 036 are targeting broader areas of simulation interoperability and should be evaluated in the light of outstanding contributions during this workshop from the C2 M&S perspective.                  2006 FALL SIW OUTBRIEF FORM
