Introduction     Advances in computer and information technology have forced civilian and military communities to reconsider all facets of their domain.  Never before have people been able to communicate, interact, or learn the way they can today.  Ten years ago the military was asking; when should we capitalize on these advances?  Today, they’re asking where and how.  The short answer is, where it makes sense.  The long answer is provided in the following discussion.The face of warfare is changing around us.  No longer can we afford to teach, plan for, or exercise our warfighters using only traditional techniques and methodologies.  Military simulations are one of many ways today’s warfighters are receiving training.  The objective of military training simulations is to augment, not replace those techniques that allow us to maintain an edge during war.  This paper presents three use cases, all of which utilize leading-edge technologies, including simulation, to provide efficient training solutions for the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force.2. Critical FactorsSuccessful training system development is accomplished through a combination of proven techniques and emerging technologies.  A proper balance between these must be achieved in order to provide a meaningful representation to your audience.  Without a proper balance, the training may be ineffective or may not reflect the goals and objectives of the desired system.  Users and developers are able to produce an effective, representative system by correctly addressing critical factors, such as automation, perception, and flexibility, within their training system design and implementation.  The level of automation within a training system is important because it defines how much interaction a trainee is forced to have with the system in order to incur the desired training results.  In some cases, real-world systems can be operated in modes that require varying levels of interaction, or in modes where no interaction is necessary.  In either case, any training designed for that system should include those same levels of automation.  User perception while utilizing a particular training system is crucial to its success and will determine at least partially, how often the system is used.  Current military simulations are capable of providing behavioral, visual, and oral, or some combination thereof, stimuli to the user. Therefore, it is essential the trainee be provided representative inputs from each of those models.  Failure to properly model one of the perceptions that are available to the user will produce an inconsistent, or inappropriate training solution. Flexibility within training systems is measured in several ways, including the number and variety of training options it provides, by its capability to dynamically produce training options, otherwise known as scenario generation, or by its ability to be used by trainees of varying proficiencies.  All training systems should strive to be as flexible as possible, as it will ensure the breadth and reuse capacities of the product.3. SAF Technology     Semi-Automated Forces (SAF) technologies, including OneSAF Test Bed (OTBSAF), Joint Semi-Automated Forces (JSAF) and Modular Semi-Automated Forces (ModSAF), considered each of the critical factors described above during development.  These applications are a government-owned, distributed simulation program that is configured to a low-cost personal computer (PC) using the Linux operating system.  SAF simulations support individual, team, and inter-team training and thus allow a broad user base to benefit from the underlying modeling and simulation technologies.4. BFTT AMN     The principal operational objective of the U.S. Navy’s Battle Force Tactical Training (BFTT) system is to provide shipboard training across the full spectrum of mission scenarios.  Those objectives are met through the employment of advanced Distributed Interactive Simulations (DIS) that stimulate various shipboard sensors.  This architecture allows for both land and sea-based BFTT systems to be integrated and provide a larger, WAN-based synthetic battlespace.  The Air Management Node (AMN) is one component of the BFTT system that provides proficiency training to Air Traffic Control (ATC) personnel in those behaviors necessary to support tactically correct departure and recovery procedures for both Rotary Wing (RWA) and Fixed Wing (FWA) aircraft.  The AMN capabilities are an extension of the High Level Architecture (HLA)-based JSAF simulation.  The communication differences between the BFTT (DIS) systems and the JSAF (HLA) simulations were overcome through the use of a gateway.  In the AMN, the gateway provides interoperability between JSAF and the DIS-based modeling and simulation components of the BFTT system.  The gateway has also been used to integrate other legacy and real-world systems for the Navy and Air Force, including cockpit simulators and Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems.  Systems engineering, planning, and implementation costs and risks were reduced through the use of this gateway.  See [1] for a detailed discussion of the integration efforts required to support the AMN.The AMN, through BFTT, is interfaced with the SPN-35 radar system, a shipboard sensor that provides a visual representation of an aircraft’s glide slope and glide path during its approach.  This architecture forced the AMN development team to consider both the visual and behavioral perceptions provided by the training system.  Therefore, if an aircraft approaching the ship is viewed on the SPN-35 as having a correct glide slope and glide path, yet the aircraft is flying upside down, it is possible to satisfy the visual requirement while failing the behavioral.  The AMN provides realistic inputs in both of these areas through the development of tactically correct launch and land recovery representations.Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) often provide a high-risk, high-reward implementation opportunity.  Intuitive, simple, and fast are a few of the words many mention while evaluating a particular GUI implementation.  All of those criteria listed above, as well as inputs from the user community, were considered during the design of the AMN’s Human Computer Interface (HCI) GUI. The HCI GUI (see Figure 1) allows an AMN operator, or pseudo-pilot, to create, launch, maneuver, handoff, join, or recover single or multiple aircraft concurrently.  A rapid prototyping methodology was used for this interface in order to maximize the reuse opportunities and reduce the probability of delays in the development schedule if design flaws occurred.  This drove the design of the HCI GUI to present aircraft information in a tabular display, resembling a spreadsheet.  This proved to be an interesting challenge for the AMN development team, as the GUI was implemented using Motif, a Unix-based, open source graphical development environment, rather than a Windows-based solution.  A thorough design, driven by user inputs contributed to a successful GUI implementation.  See [2] for a detailed discussion of the development methodology used for the AMN HCI GUI.5. DMT C2     In order to improve the readiness of its Command and Control (C2) personnel, the Air Force supported the development of the Mission Training Rehearsal System (MTRS).  MTRS is a prototype designed to further the goals and objectives of Distributed Mission Training (DMT) through the use of enhanced, integrated technologies. Many of these same technologies provide fighter training support for USAF F-15 and F-16 cockpits that include interactions with flight crews. In this case, the technologies were used in the design and implementation of a training suite for the Ground Theater Air Control System (GTACS) that includes SAF, voice recognition, artificially intelligent tutors, and courseware.  The MTRS end-state vision is to have all or most operators accessing the same mission rehearsal scenario from their desktop computer or equivalent mission interface to conduct combat processes, in real time, over a distributed network.  In a Theater Air Control System (TACS) C2 operational architecture, the Control and Reporting Center (CRC) is directly subordinate to an Air Operation Center (AOC) and is the primary mobile radar element concerned with decentralized execution of air operations.  The CRC is a worldwide deployable battlespace management platform employed at the tactical level to support air operations planning and execution across the entire range of operations, from military operations other than war (MOOTW) to a major theater war (MTW). Although the MTRS prototype targeted four duty stations within the TACS, only the CRC WD will be discussed in detail.The WD’s Operator Console Unit (OCU) contains two finger-on-glass (FOG) interfaces that provide the WD with both a data and a visual display of his airspace (see Figure 2).   Since the OCU’s radar interface is the TPS-75, it was necessary to simulate this sensor within SAF.  This was achieved through the inclusion of a common radar model, with the appropriate parametric inputs for a TPS-75, on a computer generated forces (CGF) representation of the TACS Operations Module (OM) van.  This model provides the flexible and realistic radar necessary to create a representative scenario within the synthetic battlespace.  Initial scenarios for the WD included a 1 versus 1 (1v1) intercept that required the WD to maneuver his aircraft in position for achievement of a stern conversion, and a 2 versus 2 (2v2) intercept that exercised the WD’s ability to monitor and react to a congested airspace.  The 1v1 is a focused, deliberate exercise that the trainee can use to practice common phraseology with his aircraft and learn the associated switch actions.  The 2v2 on the other hand, is an extension of the 1v1 procedures, where the actions of the trainee may have an impact on other aspects within the current exercise.  Since MTRS is a prototype, its capabilities as a comprehensive training system were not fully realized, but the potential has been shown, and is available through the optimal use of the underlying technologies.Several technical challenges were overcome during the development of this prototype through the use of emerging techniques and technologies.  As discussed above, the WD’s interface consisted of two FOG displays.  Initially, it was not the team’s intention to simulate the FOG capabilities of the real-world system, but to develop and configure the software in such a way that the trainee would not be negatively impacted by an alternative mouse-driven representation.  However, through research the team was able to find a relatively low cost FOG (touchscreen) hardware substitute.  The touchscreen monitor was a plug-and-play solution and did not require software modifications.  A similar technology was researched before the program began, but was deemed too expensive at the time.The creation of a seamless, familiar training environment was one of the goals of the MTRS development team.  If successful, this would allow the trainee to execute all facets of his training from a single Windows-based PC. Since the courseware and voice recognition applications within MTRS were developed in Windows, and the simulation component was developed in Linux, the team needed a way to integrate the execution of these applications.  This was achieved through the use of Virtual Network Computing (VNC).  VNC allows for the distributed display and execution of applications across heterogeneous environments.  Within MTRS, VNC allows the operator to execute all phases of his training from within Microsoft Internet Explorer, even though the underlying applications were developed in Linux, Windows NT, and Windows 98.  Low cost, open source solutions, such as VNC, continue to improve the products this community is able to produce.MTRS demonstrated the ability to network AOC and CRC WD functions in a common environment.  The impact of MTRS and its capabilities allows Weapons Directors (WD’s) the opportunity to train with DMT pilots and aircrews as well as conduct their own individual in-house skills training using JSAF constructive simulation and voice interactions with artificial intelligent agents.  6. AVCATT-A     The Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer – Aviation Reconfigurable Manned Module (AVCATT-A) system aims to provide a realistic synthetic training environment (STE) in which Army aviators can conduct collective training to standards specified in the Army Training and Evaluation Program (ARTEP).  Currently under development, the program requires integration between CGF technologies, as well as the U.S. Army’s RWA manned modules.  Interoperability between these systems is achieved through the DIS protocol to include model, simulation management, and environmental interactions.  The AVCATT-A program is attempting to reach a broad training audience through the employment of a mobile training facility.  This facility is designed to be self-sufficient in case of hardware or software failures and is maintained by a Battle Master Control (BMC) console operator. Systems within the facility include a BMC workstation; six RWA manned modules, and various CGF support workstations.  The BMC operator has many functions within AVCATT-A, including communications processing, battle management, and the timely creation and execution of exercise scenarios.  This configuration provides the Army with a flexible, cost-efficient training solution.Improved networking and computer processing capabilities have allowed SAF simulations to create high-fidelity CGF representations like never before.  This does not mean; however, that all aspects of a simulation should, or must, contain a complex modeling approach.  Where and how a system chooses to contain high-fidelity representations, both physically and behaviorally, should be analyzed critically.  Since AVCATT-A focuses on key aspects of RWA unit-level training, behaviors that support those objectives, such as tether (follow simulator), should be optimized.  Other behaviors, such as some of the command and control elements within AVCATT-A, could be modeled at a lower fidelity than that of the real world, but may be satisfactory based on a system’s requirements.  In addition, a realistic physical representation of CGF must be provided to support any visualization requirements a system may have.  The RWA manned modules within AVCATT-A contain image generators that provide the cockpits with a physical representation of the synthetic training environment.  Therefore, it is essential that both behavioral and physical interoperability issues be considered during the development of distributed training systems.Another important aspect of a training system is its capability to provide a “fair fight.”  Within AVCATT-A, the development team must provide a “fair fight” environment through the integration of the CGF and manned module components.  Therefore, CGF and manned module representations of common models must prevent one force from obtaining an unfair advantage, while employing a realistic model.  This concept is crucial to a system’s training objectives, but difficult to achieve if the relevant components do not contain similar modeling approaches.  SAF simulations utilize common models.  These models, such as damage, are developed such that the same physical component of a system may be reused, with parameters that are unique to that instance, on all appropriate platforms.  The manned modules, on the other hand, have developed unique implementations of each model based on the platform type.  Both approaches may be valid for a particular domain, but the differences present challenges while trying to provide a “fair fight” environment for the trainees.  For AVCATT-A, these challenges are being overcome through the collaboration and comprehension of the two implementations, leveraged by the system requirements.  Modeling compromises between the two systems may occur where representations do not afford an optimal solution. These techniques should be considered when trying to provide a “fair fight” environment, but they should never outweigh any inherent advantage (or disadvantage) one physical system may have over another.  See [3] for a detailed discussion of the development and reuse components within AVCATT-A.7. SummaryTraining today is more complex than ever before.  In part, this is due to the state-of-the-art sensors, communications, and weapons and control systems that are being utilized.  In addition, the military is being forced to operate these systems with decreasing amounts of funding and manpower.  One way the military is trying to overcome these obstacles is through the development of training systems such as the BFTT AMN, DMT C2, and AVCATT-A.  All of these systems have simulation as a common element, but utilize other technologies, such as VNC, and other methods, to provide a realistic, flexible training environment.  This proves that bridging the gap between simulation and training is accomplished as much through simulation, as it is through the integration of supporting techniques and applications.  Simulation developers and users should capitalize on similar advances and use them to create training systems that address a broader range of training system issues.8.
