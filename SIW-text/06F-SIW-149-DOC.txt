Name of Forum or Group:  CFIChairTrevor PearceVice ChairSteve BoswellSecretaryVacantObjectives for this Workshop:Papers as usual.Panel discussion on Simulation Interoperability (joint with RD&E) – get community aware of upcoming presence of TENA.Where possible, use joint sessions to avoid multiple presentations – two joint sessions: RD&E (1 extra length paper presentation + panel discussion (above)) and DSPT. Comments and Recommendations:Good crop of papers and presentations. All papers accepted for presentation were presented (i.e. there were no no-show presenters). Several presentations generated significant discussion, and discussion had to be cut off to maintain schedule.The Simulation Interoperability panel discussion (joint with RD&E) was organized and moderated by CFI Chair, and was well received. The community seems to be more aware of the presence of TENA, and much hallway discussion has ensued. (Personal) Observation: the SISO audience does not have a general grasp on what TENA is (and is not). There are many rumors, which fuel discussion but are not necessarily grounded in facts. Recommendation: Do not let the momentum stall! Carry on with this topic at the next SIW – leaving the SISO community to wrestle with the rumors will not help.(Personal) Observation: audience seems to be shifting, and some good newcomers seem willing to participate. This would be a good time to take up Andreas Tolk’s ongoing efforts to create a more rigorous paper approval process to improve the externally perceived credibility of SIW papers.  Recommendation: Adjust the paper review process to provide more detailed reviews – ones that could be realistically seen by external people as a peer review process. I (Trevor Pearce) would be willing to work with a SISO team to adjust the review process.Recommendation: To further increase the external credibility of SISO papers, consider an electronic journal. Populate the journal by several avenues:Invite SIWSie winners to submit more detailed (and thoroughly reviewed) versions of their papers.Invite papers on “special issues” that focus on a specific topic of interest to the SISO audience.Perhaps a “Special Issue” of the SCS Journal might be useful start (or alternative)? I (Trevor Pearce) would be happy to work with a SISO team to pursue journal options further. Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)30Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)45Peak attendance (including joint sessions)  Panel with  RD&E60Total papers presented7“No-show” presentations0Other presentations and panel discussionsRecommended Reading List nomination: 06F-SIW-107                 2006 FALL SIW OUTBRIEF FORM
