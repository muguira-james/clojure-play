Network Centric Warfare. Asymmetric conflict. Effects Based Operations. The Defense establishment is embarked on a number of new initiatives aimed at transforming itself to meet the challenges of a new era. Central to all of these initiatives is the need to identify novel solutions, as well as unexpected threats, in a force and system neutral manner. This paper presents an emerging idea for directly modeling the chain of effects proposed by each side, in a two-sided or multi-sided engagement. The theoretical basis for the concept is described in terms of named probability regions called “Effects Spaces”. Effects Spaces exist in well defined spatial-temporal regions, which impose a specified list of probable effects on specific type entities in those regions during the time the region exists. These probable effects may be lethal or non-lethal, and may also include psychological and geopolitical effects as well as traditional combat effects. The emphasis is on the “what” rather than the “how”, so the effects are force and system neutral. The effects serve as constraints on possible force, system and doctrine specific solutions, and easily include restrictions on operations such as reduced collateral damage and non-combatant injury. Effects can easily be asymmetric, with one side’s actions prompting a competitor to do something not obviously related to the initial provocation.  For capabilities developments, such as are called for in the new US DOD Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170 series directing use of the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS), useful chains of effects can form concepts of operation and serve as a template for nominating existing or proposed forces and systems to produce the desired effects, and for assessing how well the proposed solutions achieve those effects. The end result is then a simulation based approached to capabilities identification, in place of the architecture based approach currently favored. Thus this paper promises to be both academically and professionally interesting to the SIW audience, as we explore new ways for simulation to meet the challenges of the 21st Century.Introduction.“As we prepare for the future, we must think differently and develop the kinds of forces and capabilities that can adapt quickly to new challenges and to unexpected circumstances.” Donald Rumsfeld [1]Defense Transformation and the Transformed WorldThe United States is embarked on a comprehensive transformation of its armed forces, guided by fundamental changes in strategy and doctrine, and empowered by rapidly evolving technologies [2]. This transformation, in turn, is driven by fundamental changes in global geopolitics, positive and negative effects of globalization of commence and media, concern and dislocation among many, if not most, populations and cultures, and by the same rapid evolution of technology that makes military transformation possible. New war fighting concepts such as Effects Based Operations and Network Centric Warfare are central to this transformation from an Industrial Age military to an Information Age military. Inherent in these concepts is the need for full spectrum capabilities that include military and non-military means to counter a wide range of emerging asymmetric threats as well as more traditional military threats. And these are further driven by the need to see the nature and specifics of actions and threats, influence actions and counter threats precisely through non-lethal and, if necessary, lethal, means, and project power rapidly to and within far-flung global trouble spots. In his book, Effects Based Operations, Dr. Edward Smith defines Effects Based Operations as “coordinated sets of actions directed at shaping the behavior of friends, foes, and neutrals in peace, crisis, and war” [3]. Smith later emphasizes “that effects may be either kinetic or non-kinetic, and may equally be either physical or psychological/cognitive in nature.” [4]. In a Pentagon press briefing in March 2003, US Air Force COL Gary Crowder further explains that Effects Based Operations include lethal as well as non-lethal actions, all aimed not directly at opposing forces but rather crafted to achieve or further some policy objective, or end state [5].  Alberts, Garstka, and Stein, in their book Network Centric Warfare: Developing and Leveraging Information Superiority, define Network Centric Warfare as “an information superiority-enabled concept of operations that generates increased combat power by networking sensors, decision makers, and shooters to achieve shared awareness, increased speed of command, higher tempo of operations, greater lethality, increased survivability, and a degree of self synchronization. In essence, NCW translates information superiority into combat power by effectively linking knowledgeable entities in the battlespace.” [6]. Smith elegantly ties these two concepts together in his first page: “…effects-based operations provide the “end” for our network-centric “means.” [7]. Smith also points out how asymmetric warfare, by which the protagonists use different means directed at different vulnerabilities and assets of their opponents to offset opponent advantages to achieve their goals, is largely a contest of effects that focus one side’s relative strengths against the other’s relative weaknesses [8]. Thus we have the three major transformational concepts currently being explored, and pursued, by the US military, many of its allies, as well as many of its actual and potential adversaries: Network Centric Warfare empowering Effects Based Operations in the context of Asymmetric Warfare. These are the drivers behind a move from threat based military systems requires to the new DoD approach of identifying and describing desirable capabilities that apply technologies, processes, organizations and knowledge in a comprehensive manner aimed at producing specific effects over a wide range of conflict situations.Capabilities Development vice Threat Based Requirements GenerationThe Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) was established by a Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI 3170) in June 2003. JCIDS mandates a capabilities identification and development process based on Joint Functional Concepts for future military operations. Current and future systems are then measured against the capabilities identified in the functional concepts, in the context of systems of systems employed by Joint forces. The systems are authorized for development and fielding under tight controls specified in CJCSI and CJCSM 3170, in addition to the controls imposed by the US Defense Acquisition System. [9]. [10]. This capabilities based approach replaces a threat based requirements system. Threat based requirements generation arose as a risk reduction mechanism during the Cold War. Then the critical concern for NATO and member states was how to invest in defense and the underlying technology of defense in the most efficient manner to counter the specific major threats posed by Soviet military power and technology. This was the overarching threat and by far the most challenging, and the thinking went that if the Soviet threat were met, all other threats could also be met. The fact that most other confrontation involved the US and its allies, equipped with US or NATO designed weapons, facing Soviet allies or former allies, equipped with Soviet weapons or copies of Soviet weapons. Thus the threat based approach worked well for those times. With the demise of the Soviet Union, other countries as well as non-state actors had to opportunity to rise to greater regional profiles. Without the economic and political constraints to proliferation of weapon systems imposed by a two-power world order, potentially hostile nations gained access to weapons and technology that did not arise from the Soviet military-industrial complex. And, freed of the larger ideological conflict of communism versus democracy, states and non-state actors developed their own agendas, based on their national, religious, or ideological goals and aspirations. The result, throughout the 1990’s and into the 21st Century, is a world where military threats are harder to detect, much less predict, and are prone to rapid change. The rapid advance of technology, and the rapid technological advance of a good many developing nations, further accelerates this trend to volatile and unpredictable change. Moreover, the Information Age further accelerates this trend, with no one nation having a monopoly on the next big idea or dominating information technology. This has led the US defense establishment to move to a capabilities based concepts and technology development approach. Challenges in Identifying Desired Capabilities“The path to NCO is forked. One road, often called “modernization,” is the straightest and most clearly signed. Traveling this road is clearly within the comfort zone of the institution (DoD) and most of its members. Unfortunately, this road will lead us only to incremental improvements and, ultimately, to a dead end.”David S. Alberts and Richard E. Hayes:     Power to the Edge [11]JCIDS describes broadly how needed capabilities will be identified and concepts that aspire to deliver those capabilities will be assessed and approved. However, there are some initial problems in adopting this new approach. Key among these is the need to change planners’ mindsets to think in terms of the underlying capability, that is, the effects it can produce, rather than the means used to deliver the capability. This problem is reinforced by the habits of an establishment accustomed to thinking more in terms of the threat, and less in terms of a truly Joint, broadly capable, set of interoperable mission capability packages. (See [12] and [13] for a full description of the mission capability package concept.) Why is this so, and how do we fix it? Causes range from an honest difficulty in moving away from the familiar and imagining new opportunities. This is reinforced by the many vested interests preferring to regulate, if not stop, institutional change. And finally DOD “corporate culture” has ingrained traditional, service oriented doctrinal approaches that shape the training and experience base of planners, and also skew the official and approved knowledge bases underlying concepts and doctrine development in the direction of traditional approaches. Here are some typical problems encountered in identifying transformational military concepts:Legacy Think“Legacy Think” describes the tendency to keep doing things the way they are done now, especially if that’s how they have been done for a long time. So legacy think tends to be self reinforcing. Unfortunately, legacy think also predisposes the planner to over crediting the performance of legacy solutions, and under crediting the potential of new approaches. Typically, benchmarking the performance of the legacy approach is avoided or passed over, based on the assumption that it works good enough and no one likely wants to know it does not. This of course does not apply when a real-world failure in the legacy approach occurs, but then again the planning process purports to avoid these kinds of costly negative experiences. Moreover, thinking through truly new ways to do something is not only mentally hard, and politically risky, but time consuming as well. So all too often the “needed capability” looks much like the existing threat-based “requirement”.Group Think“Group Think” describes the tendency of like minded people to think alike. The military training establishment strives hard to train the officers and their professional civilian peers in applying the doctrinal solution. Hence, when a group of similarly trained individuals addresses capability identification and development, the tendency is often to come to similar conclusions based on that training and background. Another group, with a different upbringing, say in a different branch of service, will likely come up with markedly different solutions. The main danger here though is not that problem solving groups will succumb to group think, but rather that the solution is driven by which groups are given the problem, and often by who shows up to form the group. Other good solutions are never generated, which curtails the potential for truly Joint solutions arising from inter-group discussions of alternative approaches.As an aside, group think poses a unique challenge for planning Effects Based Operations, since as Smith points out “[Effects Based Operations embrace the premise that] different observers with different levels and kinds of experience, mental models, national or organizational cultures, and understandings of the situation will make sense of the same action in different ways and reach different decisions as to how to respond to the stimulus.” [14]. A group of like minded individuals will likely have a difficult time imaging and planning for the expected, and often desired, diverse reactions to delivered effects.ParochialismThe dark side of group think is blatant parochialism, where military service, branch, or community proponents advance the goals of their community, and defend their turf, to the detriment of more effective alternatives that threaten their interests or budgets. However, this is all too often the driver the bureaucratic infighting that surrounded the old requirements process and threatens to continue to frustrate the new capabilities identification approach. Service, Force, and Tactics Based Task TreesOne subtle contributor to all of the problems outlined above is the nature on the uniform task lists used as a starting point by JCIDS and most other current needs identification processes. These task lists are arrayed as hierarchical trees of tasks, with the more general tasks higher up the three, decomposing into more specific supporting tasks at lower levels. However, the trees have no multiple parent cross-connections, so each decomposition flows from a high level general military task. These high level tasks tend to reflect major air, land, or naval operations, so when a group of planners starts to identify those tasks that comprise a desired capability, they quickly lock into a rather specific operational approach that leads them away from other alternative or supporting approaches. Thus synergistic Joint combinations of tasks are disfavored by the current task tree methodology, while traditional stovepipes tend to be reinforced.Task, System, and Force Neutral Capability DescriptionsSo what seems to be needed is a way to get to capabilities without thinking in terms of the tasks, systems, or forces providing the capabilities. Moreover, the real goal is to identify the effects sought from the capabilities, and then identify or define capabilities that produce those effects. This provides a way to avoid the problems described above. So the problem becomes how do we back up the capabilities idfentication process one additional step, and try to describe directly the chain of effects that lead to desired outcomes?The Effects Space Concept – Getting to System and Force Neutral Capabilities “The massing of forces is being transformed into a massing of effects…” David S. Alberts [15]Effects ChainsSmith describes how effects should be applied in cascades and nests of effects [16]. I extend this concept to view the concept of an operation as a chain, or a directed network, of effects imposed over specific regions of the conflict space at specific times. The final effect defines the outcome of the operation. (And ideally, the outcome of the operation, or of a campaign of operations, defines the outcome of the conflict.) Describing Effects: Effects SpacesThis raises the question of how we should describe the effects in the chain. We can simply name effects, and form a concise lexicon of named effects that then support future planning. Or we can enhance our definition with a qualitative description of each effect. But from a rigorous analytical perspective, I say that we need to define these effects in a precise quantitative manner. I believe that probability regions associated with specific four dimensional spaces will allow us to do this. I call these regions “Effects Spaces”. These effects spaces provide planners a convenient model of the effects they impose on the conflict space, describing a desired capability, that is the capability to meet the conditions of the effects space, in a force and system neutral manner. Figure 1 illustrates the concept of spaces defining effects imposed over specific regions of terrain. SHAPE  \* MERGEFORMAT                Figure 1. Concept for “Effects Spaces”Defining Probability Regions as Space and Probability VectorsMathematically, we can define these effects spaces as vectors made up of the four dimension elements (x, y, z, and t), with start and end points, followed by a series of probabilities that specific effects will be felt by specific entities in the region. Thus we might define a region that exists over a 20 by 20 kilometer area from the surface to 100 meters in which armored vehicles face a probability of destruction of greater than 80%, friendly forces face a probability of destruction of less than 0.1 %, and non-combatants face a probability of destruction less than 0.05% and probability of injury of less than 1%.  Figure 2 illustrates several effects spaces accompanied by their defining probability vectors. SHAPE  \* MERGEFORMAT Figure 2. Effects Spaces and Probability VectorsEffects Space Static Use Case ExampleGiven this conceptual construct of effects spaces, rigorously defined as probability regions, planners can then chain and network sets of effects into an operational sequence. Each effect impacts the next, changing the mission space in either a temporary or permanent manner. Lingering effects stay around to help or impede subsequent effects, as well as subsequent actions by opponents. As seen in Figure 3, a chain of effects spaces overlaid on terrain and an opposing scenario rapidly begins to look like a concept of operations (CONOPS) graphic. SHAPE  \* MERGEFORMAT Figure 3. Effects Spaces Chained as a CONOPSDynamic, Temporal Nature of Effects SpacesA complex network of effects spaces, each with its own region and time of existence, will be difficult to work with in a static planning environment. Some effects spaces, as diverse as area denial, economic conditions, and popular opinion, will have long life spans that planners must consider as they plan grand strategies and lengthy campaigns. Others are essentially instantaneous, such as destructive effects on very narrowly defined entity classes in the affected region. Keeping track of the state of the mission space will be a demanding job. However, I believe the solution is well known and understood, and is simulation. Simulation changes and maintains state from one time step to the next. This is exactly what we need to manage these effects spaces, defined as spatial-temporal probability regions.From Effects Spaces to Capabilities to SolutionsOnce planners are comfortable with a course of action defining a CONOPS, made up of a sequence or network of effects spaces, the quantitative nature of the probability regions defined by the effects spaces can be used to define performance based capabilities. Several alternative CONOPS courses of action could be generated and compared at this point. These steps roughly fulfill the Functional Area Analysis and Functional Needs Analysis called for in the first two steps of the JCIDS process. In practice, planners or their operational analysts would run some excursions to determine how to minimize the number of effects spaces as well as the number and threshold values of the probability constraints within each space. This step establishes the maximum performance required, and hence the minimum acceptable performance level for the corresponding capability. For example, if an alternative course of action can be made to work with a probability that opposing armored vehicles face a probability of neutralization of 75% rather than 90%, and the desired end effect is still achieved, then the required capability is to neutralize 75% of opposing armored vehicles in a specified region, rather than 90%. The difference between 90% and 75 % will typically allow many more specific solution approaches to suffice, and typically leads to quicker and cheaper fielded solutions. The next step would call for planners and technologists to identify or design alternative mission capability packages, made of specific tasks, forces, and systems.  The quantified capability, such as the 75% neutralization in the example given, becomes a measure of merit for candidate solutions. Solution performance can be calculated from engineering data in the initial process of considering, accepting, or rejecting possible solution approaches. Later, simulation can be used to further explore and quantify the dynamic performance of solution packages. These steps should satisfy the JCIDS Functional Solutions Analysis requirements. A by-product could be the discovery that even lower capability performance appears to work, which could then be use to lower the capability threshold, further deconstrain the problem, and allow for still more solutions. The JCIDS Post Independent Analysis could also be supported by this approach, using a multi-attribute or portfolio approach to look at both how the events in the event chain contribute to achieving the larger geopolitical goals of the conflict analysis scenarios, how the solution packages contribute to providing the identified capabilities, and how the forces and systems are most optimally assigned and combined into Joint Force and Network Centric systems of systems.Simulation as a Way to Work With Dynamic Effects Spaces“The effects-based operation does not begin with the physical action we may decide to execute. It begins with all those actions we have taken in the same area well before the current action was ever considered at all.” Edward A. Smith [17].An Approach for an Effects Space Simulation EnvironmentThe underlying mathematical definition of effects spaces as probability vectors suggest that effects spaces can be easily introduced into entity based simulations. By entity based, I mean those more modern simulations that represent individuals, platforms, units, or environmental effects as objects or entities, rather than as state equations or state attribute tables or some other more abstract approach. Note that entity based simulations may be virtual or constructive, and the entities may be discreet platforms, or aggregated units. But in either case a unique object or player is active in the simulated space. In such simulated environments then, effects spaces can be instantiated as a new type of player, represented directly as a probability “cloud” affecting specific regions at specific times. This is very similar to how many simulations treat area fires or chemical agents. The result would be a simulated world in which specific friendly, neutral and/or opposing forces encounter abstract effects spaces, and have their states changed accordingly, in the same way state changes occur in current simulations when entities move, shoot, communicate, and suffer damage. Later in the analysis and solution process, specific solution packages made up of distinct units and systems can replace the abstract effects spaces. This would provide a convenient way to do gap analysis between the capabilities specified by the effects space attributes and the capabilities delivered by alternative proposed solutions. Promising Concept for Federated Models In a federation of models, the effects spaces could be played separately in an appropriate existing simulation environment, while the solution systems and other aspects of the simulated world could continue to be played in their traditional federate. The effects space federate would then effectively become the effects server for the other platform and unit based federates. When a platform or unit enters a region containing an effects space, the effects server either provides the platform or unit host the attributes of the effect to impose on its players, or adjudicates the encounter directly and provides the results to the rest of the federation. Federation designers would have full discretion over which approach to use. A New Opportunity for Simulation“If effects-based operations are to be anything more than an interesting theory, we must figure out a process by which we can reliably translate the multifaceted actions we have been describing into the kinds of effects that we need to shape the behavior of friends, foes, and neutrals.”  Edward A. Smith [18]Links to the new JCIDS process were emphasized to show how simulation could become a leading, if not dominant, approach to CONOPS development, capability identification, and solution design in this new capabilities based approach to devising strategies, designing forces, and developing systems. The currently favored approach is based on C4ISR architecture analysis, and is heavily dependent on the universal task lists as starting points for capability identification. As discussed in section 2 of this paper, going directly to the current task lists risks skewing CONOPS and capability choices along legacy lines. On the other hand, simulation is relegated to a supporting role primarily in initial experimentation to understand scenario drivers and later in analysis of alternatives. However the gap between these two steps is huge, and lengthy. I believe that simulation can be used as described above to model effects, defined as effects spaces, and then migrate those effects to force and system neutral quantitative capabilities and further to mission capability packages, comprised of specific systems and units. This approach then starts with a clean slate and identifies force and system neutral capabilities that deliver a specified effect. Then existing and proposed solution forces and systems can be evaluated against how well they deliver the desired capabilities, and thus the desired effects. This provides a truly capabilities based approach, directly addresses modeling of Effects Based Operations, and is well suited to designing and analyzing complex Network Centric Warfare forces and campaigns. And it is equally suited to modeling asymmetric, symmetric or mixed conflict.Simulation would then move back into the concepts and strategy development arena, while providing a seamless path to simulation based engineering of selected systems, simulation support to real world operations, and realistic training of these new Effects Based and Network Centric approaches to asymmetric or symmetric war fighting and conflict management.References.[1] United States  Department  of  Defense, Transformation Planning Guidance, pg 1, Washington, DC April 2003,  HYPERLINK "http://www.oft.osd.mil/library/library_files/document_129_Transformation_Planning_Guidance_April_2003_1.pdf" http://www.oft.osd.mil/library/library_files/document_129_Transformation_Planning_Guidance_April_2003_1.pdf[2]  Ibid.[3] Smith, Edward Allen.
