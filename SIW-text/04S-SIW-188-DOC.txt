Transfer of Control Study GroupChairFrank Hill (absent)Vice ChairPat MerletSecretaryVacantDate2004 Spring SIW – TC SG Meeting 22 April 2004 @ 1:30PMObjectives for this Workshop:Review the state of Transfer Control, recent Study Group activities and the draft study group report.  Discuss the submission of the report (DIS content) to the DIS Product Development Group (assuming the DIS study group will become a PDG).  Discuss future work regarding RPR FOM HLA and native HLA.  Address any open issues.  Comments and Recommendations:The Transfer Control Study Group agrees with the developing plan to fold our work into existing/emerging Product Development Groups, specifically the DIS, RPR FOM, and HLA PDGs.  A discussion with Reed Little (our TAD) confirmed and validated this approach.  The DIS Study Group session earlier in the day also confirmed this approach.  The Transfer Control Study Group anticipates finalization of our report, and beginning to fold our work into the previously mentioned PDGs no later than the 2004 Fall SIW.  It is anticipated that the TC SG will stand down at that time, but the work of integrating our findings and recommendations into the appropriate PDGs and the DIS Enumeration Document will continue as necessary, with our members joining various PDG Drafting Groups to support those efforts.  Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)11Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)N/APeak attendance (including joint sessions)N/ATotal papers presentedN/A“No-show” presentationsN/AOther presentations and panel discussionsStudy Group sessionRecommended Reading List nominations (including previous nominations):N/A
