Study Group on Assessment of the Need forProduct Data Representation Standards (ANPDRS)ChairJim CoolahanVice ChairMike HaasSecretaryKim LarsenObjectives for this Workshop:Review Terms of Reference (TOR) for new participants.Discuss submitted summaries of related standards efforts.Develop outline of interim study group output.Discuss future efforts on standards needs assessment.Comments and Recommendations:Eight existing standards efforts have been reviewed for applicability; a few more will be reviewed in the coming weeks.Several near-term actions have been assigned to individual SG members, with the intent of developing a draft interim report containing summaries of existing standards related to product data representations, including the categories of models and simulations to which they apply.A machine shop data model developed under the auspices of the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is approaching readiness, and may be appropriate for a SISO Product Development Group in the near future.The area of metadata, particularly metadata related to pedigree/context for military simulation data representing products, deserves further study in the coming months by the ANPDRS SG.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)11Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)11Peak attendance (including joint sessions)11Total papers presented0“No-show” presentationsN/AOther presentations and panel discussions1Recommended Reading List nominations (including previous nominations):N/AN/AN/A
