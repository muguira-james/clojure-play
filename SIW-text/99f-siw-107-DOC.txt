The central challenge for DMT is exploiting the capabilities and affordances provided by computer-generated actors (CGAs) to create DVEs that provide a significant improvement in aircrew training quality, breadth, complexity, and realism.  To attain this new level of aircrew training, DMT will require CGAs that can satisfy stringent latency requirements in addition to presenting high fidelity behaviors.  To satisfy the latency requirements, the capability to dynamically migrate CGAs between hosts on the network will be required.  We call this capability for transparently moving CGAs from host to host robust actor migration.Robust actor migration is the ability to change the host computer for a CGA without a noticeable disruption to the CGA’s performance or behavior.  There are three types of actor migration that must be considered, the types are differentiated by the starting and ending type of control for the actor.  The three types are an actor migrating from a computer-controlled situation to a computer-controlled situation (CGA-CGA); an actor migrating from a computer-controlled situation to a human-controlled situation (CGA-HCA); and an actor migrating from a human-controlled situation to a computer-controlled situation (HCA-CGA).  In this paper, we discuss the three types of actor migration, the information that must be communicated to support each type of migration, and suggest some changes to the HLA documentation that would enable the HLA to better support migration.1.	Introduction and BackgroundEffective, realistic, and affordable computer-generated actors (CGAs) will be a crucial component in future distributed virtual environments (DVEs)5 for aircrew training.  However, an air force’s distributed mission training (DMT) environment poses more stringent latency and fidelity requirements for actor-to-actor interactions than achieved in past distributed virtual environments (DVEs).  Additionally, actors must be able to migrate into and out of human control so that humans can provide mission re-planning, critical activity support, and other decision capabilities that are beyond the abilities of CGAs.  Because of these latency, fidelity, and human control needs, the capability to transfer computer control of an actor from one computer to another across the network, called actor migration, will be required for training and analysis simulation environments.  Achieving a robust actor migration capability is one focus of our current research.  Our investigations into actor migration were conducted within the framework of the Distributed Mission Training Integrated Threat Environment (DMTITE) project6,7 and the DOD High Level Architecture (HLA)2,3,4.To migrate a CGA between computer-controlled situation, information related to actor state, fidelity, and knowledge base must be transmitted.  To accomplish a seamless transfer of control, the type of reasoning performed by the CGA and the reasoning system computation rate may also be required by the receiving host.  In the circumstance when transfer of control is required from a CGA to a manned system or vice-versa, data relating to terrain model resolution, data displayed in the cockpit, and evaluation of wingman/lead aircraft ability should also be sent.  In this paper we present a framework for analysis of these types of actor migration and suggest the data that must be transmitted to achieve a robust actor migration.  Furthermore, we suggest extensions to the High Level Architecture (HLA) that will enable it to better support and document robust actor migration activities.  In the discussion below, we use the term source to refer to the host computer that controlled and propagated the actor before the migration commenced.  We use the term recipient to refer to the host computer that will control and propagate the actor after the migration action concludes.To achieve robust actor migration, many issues must be addressed.  To organize the issues posed by robust actor migration, we began by classifying the types of actor migration.  In our analysis, the different types of robust actor migration are differentiated by the starting and ending type of control for the actor.  The three cases are where an actor moves from one host in a computer-controlled situation to another host in a computer-controlled situation (CGA-CGA); where an actor moves from a computer-controlled situation to a human-controlled situation (CGA-HCA); and where an actor moves from a human-controlled situation to a computer-controlled situation (HCA-CGA).  Each type of migration imposes different data transfer and latency requirements upon the migration activity, but some elements of the data transport requirements  are common to all three cases.  For example, the state of the actor, including position, velocity, orientation, terrain model, coordinate system, fuel, weapons load, sensor status, infrared signature, radar signature, and mission, must be communicated for all types of migration.  Then, depending upon the type of transfer performed, additional information concerning the state of the reasoning system, current knowledge, required skill level, required fidelity level, active knowledge bases, and latency requirements may also have to be transmitted. Additionally, some types of migration require that issues related to rapid establishment of situation awareness by the recipient, anticipation of transfer, and latency and accuracy of the transfer must be addressed.  Because all information transferred in support of actor migration flows within the High Level Architecture (HLA) environment, the Federation Object Model (FOM) for the DMT environment and the Simulation Model (SOM) for each participant must address the data transfer requirements imposed by each of the three cases of actor migration.  Therefore, the SOM for each entity and the FOM for the environment must be written to support all three types of actor migration.Before discussing DVE actor migration, it is instructive to examine how migration is performed in distributed agent systems, as discussed by Bharat1.  An agent is a computation in progress that can move from one network node to another network node, perform a computation at the node, and move on to another node if desired.  In the world of agents, a suitcase is data that accompanies the agent from node to node.  The suitcase contains long-term memory for the agent, the tasks to perform (the mission), and parameters for the tasks.  An agent’s arrival briefing is the information that it receives from a recipient node.  The arrival briefing contains information concerning the site’s status, availability of resources, available models, local and long-haul latencies, and other system-specific information.  An agent server provides the local briefing, accepts the agent, and is responsible for executing the code for the agent.In this paper, we discuss in detail each of the three types of actor migration, examine the information needs for each type of transfer, and discuss the data transport requirements that must be addressed and documented for the data in each transfer situation.  In section two we discuss each of the three types of actor migration.  In section three we examine the information transport requirements for each of the three control transfer situations and the contents of the briefing that the recipient should provide.  Section four presents our recommended changes to the HLA SOM and FOM documentation.  Section five contains our conclusions.2.	Types of Actor MigrationWhen an actor in a DVE migrates from one host to another, the data that must be transferred depends upon the type of control for the actor at both the source and the recipient hosts.  The differences in the data required to be transported arise from the type of reasoning the recipient must provide and from the anticipated DVE operational conditions that the recipient controller will encounter.  We briefly consider each factor to illuminate the arguments we present in later sections for the data to be transported.  Tables 1, 2, and 3 provide summaries for the following discussion of the types of migration and the information that must be transmitted to execute a successful migration.Type of CGA-HCA MigrationRequired SuitcasesPlannedActor state informationReasoning system stateAbstract missionUnplanned1)	Actor state information2)	Reasoning system state3)	Situation awarenessTable 1: Information Transport Requirements for CGA-HCA MigrationIn the case where the recipient is human-controlled, a CGA-HCA migration, we anticipate that the human will be inserted into a situation where critical decisions must be made or where key aspects of the mission (either decision making or activity) are being performed.  Our rationale for this assumption is that human operators are a costly and therefore scarce commodity.  Therefore, human expertise and flexibility must be conserved and used to enhance the realism and fidelity of the simulation environment at the times when human intervention and interaction have the greatest impact on the training outcome.  We contend that the decisions made at the key preplanned mission points and in critical or crisis situations are the ones that have the most influence, and hence the ones most likely to call for a CGA-HCA migration.  We can differentiate two sub-cases of CGA-HCA migration, unplanned and planned.  Unplanned migration occurs in response to a crisis for the CGA and can generally be characterized as a situation wherein a decision must be made in short order and the objective of the migration is to ensure the actor’s survival over the next few moments.  The major components of the mission plan remain relatively unaffected, a swift migration is crucial, and it can be fairly assumed that the CGA will be able to continue on its assigned mission if it survives.  A planned migration, on the other hand, occurs at points in the mission wherein known limitations to the CGA’s reasoning mechanisms will be encountered.  In these circumstances, it can reasonably be anticipated that there will be ample time for considered reasoning and so a complete picture of the mission and of the CGA’s current state should be provided.  The significant components of the CGA’s mission can be pre-positioned at the recipient or they can be transmitted when required the same network that the supports the DVE.Type of HCA-CGA MigrationRequired SuitcasesCritical decision periodActor state informationReasoning system stateComplete mission statusKey Mission PeriodActor state informationReasoning system stateAbstract mission followed by complete missionForcedActor state informationReasoning system stateAbstract mission followed by complete mission statusTable 2: Information Transport Requirements for HCA-CGA MigrationIn either CGA-CGA or HCA-CGA migration, the type of control at the source for the actor indicates the type of information that must be transferred and the source also indicates of the purpose of the migration.  In HCA-CGA migration, we can reasonably assume that the actor is emerging from either a critical decision period, from a key phase of the mission, or that the human operator is commanding the migration so that another actor can migrate into the host (forced migration).  In all three cases, speed of migration is not a driving requirement for the process.  If the actor is emerging from a critical decision period, then the recipient requires information about the actor’s current state and the changes made to the mission plan.  On the other hand, if the actor is emerging from a key mission phase or if the human operator is simply forcing the actor to migrate, a thorough transfer of state information and mission information is required.  In these circumstances, there should be ample time to support the migration using the network facilities that host the distributed training environment.Type of CGA-CGA MigrationRequired SuitcasesUnplanned, fidelityActor state informationReasoning system stateComplete missionPlannedActor state informationReasoning system stateComplete mission statusUnplanned, latencyActor state informationReasoning system stateComplete missionSituation awarenessTable 3: Information Transport Requirements for CGA-CGA MigrationWhen a CGA-CGA migration is being performed we can reasonably assume that the migration is either planned or is being executed to reduce latency or to improve the fidelity of the CGA by placing it on a host that has lower computational load.  For a planned CGA-CGA migration we can assume that the actor is moving so as to conserve computational resources or to minimize latencies for upcoming interactions. There should be ample time to support the migration using the network facilities that host the distributed training environment and the migration has minimal time constraints. Therefore, there is time for the CGA to develop situation awareness after the migration concludes, therefore only the actor state, complete mission, and reasoning system state suitcases are required.  For an unplanned CGA-CGA latency migration, the objective of the migration is to raise the performance of the CGA because of deficiencies in its performance.  Since the CGA’s performance is sub-standard, the migration should be executed swiftly and the recipient requires the complete information in addition to a complete description of the CGA’s current state.  The recipient also requires the situation awareness suitcase since the recipient immediately needs information about the current threat(s) facing the actor.  In an unplanned CGA-CGA fidelity migration the recipient requires the actor state information, complete mission description for the actor, and the situation awareness suitcase since it must immediately respond to the threats faced by the actor.  In addition, the recipient must know the state of the reasoning system.  Since additional computational power is needed to achieve the desired fidelity, the source must provide sufficient information to insure that the recipient engages the most powerful available decision mechanisms for the actor.3.	Information Transportation Requirements for Actor MigrationTo execute any of the types of actor migration outlined in the preceding section, a significant amount of data must be transported between the source and recipient hosts.  Additionally, the actor must be terminated at the source host and initiated at the recipient.  In keeping with the presentation above, we will discuss each type of migration in turn.  In this section we discuss the information required to support each type of specific migration.  Before turning to each individual type of migration, we discuss the suitcases and their contents.  This section concludes with a discussion of the actor’s arrival briefing.3.1	Actor Suitcase SpecificationEach type of migration requires actor state information in its own suitcase, as noted in Tables 1 through 3.  Therefore, the actor state information suitcase must contain the entity type, force ID, location, velocity, acceleration, altitude, orientation, call-sign, dead-reckoning algorithm, camouflage scheme, and formation information.  Other required actor state information includes current damage, aerodynamics model(s), weapons, and fuel load.  Additional required actor state information includes on-board sensors, on-board sensors power settings, on-board sensors status, frequency, sweep, centerline, modes, airframe radar-cross section model, airframe infrared model, flight/mission commander or lead, terrain model, coordinate system, and radio frequency assignments.  Finally, the recipient requires information about the actor’s skill level(s), current fidelity level, the values for the actor’s combat psychology model, and subscriptions and publications for the actor.Another suitcase required in several different migration situations is the situation awareness suitcase.  The situation awareness suitcase transmits information needed by a CGA reasoning system or a human to assemble a representation of the current threat situation(s) faced by the actor.  Because a threat situation can rapidly change, this suitcase is used only in situations when a migration is unplanned and when the actor must respond to circumstances in the environment soon after the migration is executed.  The information in this suitcase includes the types of threats and their location, velocity, altitude, and orientation.  The suitcase also holds the location/direction to threat radar systems and the location, direction, and velocity of missiles/rockets that have been launched.  One issue that this suitcase raises is the effective and rapid presentation of  information to the human in a CGA-HCA migration.  Since the actor is migrating under circumstances where danger or some other extreme challenge exists, there is not much time available for the human to assimilate the 3D situation, assess the situation, and act.  The means for rapidly and effectively communicating this information to the human operator is an open research topic.Transmission of the actor’s mission or changes in the mission is a component of several of the migrations and minimum information is transported in the mission suitcase.  We identified two variants of the mission suitcase, the complete mission suitcase, which transports the complete mission description and the abstract mission suitcase, which transports only the changes to a baseline mission description.  The complete mission suitcase contains all of the information required by the recipient to enable it to execute the assigned mission.  To define this suitcase we had to determine the components of an aircraft mission for the purposes of CGA decision making.  In making this assessment, we examined the information used in the real-world to describe an aircraft mission.  In the real-world, an aircraft mission tasking is described using a set of target locations, target priorities, weapons to use on each target, refueling orbits, call signs, mission phases, mission way points and timings (way points generally coincide with the passing from one mission phase to the next).  Other mission description information includes mission initial points, patrol orbits/areas, flight altitudes for each phase of the mission, radar settings (modes, frequencies, power), jammer settings, decoy and chaff procedures, formations, aircraft intervals, expected mission duration, and fuel load.  Additional mission information is the location of friendly forces, the location of enemy formations, expected engagement areas for enemy aircraft and air defense systems, radar frequencies used by enemy systems, and location(s) of forward air controllers and airborne warning and control systems (AWACS).  Finally, the mission suitcase must transport the desired fidelity level(s) for the actor for each phase of the mission.  We should point out that some information required for a real-world mission is not needed, for example search and rescue procedures are not required by a CGA.  On the other hand, in the DMT world the recipient requires information not provided in the real-world.  The recipient must know the actor’s current fidelity level(s), the values for the actor’s skill levels, and the values for the actor’s combat psychology model (as noted previously, the actor state suitcase carries this information).  The abstract mission suitcase holds the subset of the mission suitcase that has changed since the initial mission was loaded.The fourth migration suitcase is the reasoning system state suitcase.  When determining the components of the reasoning system to be transferred, we assumed that even in the case where the actor moves into a HCA situation, it will eventually move on to a CGA situation.  As a result, all of the information that an actor needs to reason and function in a CGA situation must move with the actor for each migration.  In the case where the actor executes a HCA-CGA migration, the reasoning state is composed of that information that was migrated into the HCA host.  Since we must make the information available at successive hosts, an obvious question is when to transport the reasoning system state information.  We believe that the information should be moved each time so that reasoning system state does not accumulate at a host and to minimize the chance that the reasoning system state is lost if a host fails.Another issue that must be considered is the information that should be moved to transfer reasoning state.  A CGA’s reasoning state has three components.  The components are the current state of the decision mechanisms, the history of past decisions, and the contents of its knowledge bases. Clearly, the information transferred in the reasoning system suitcase will depend upon the type(s) of decision mechanisms used by the actor.  We assume that the knowledge base contents are pre-positioned at each potential recipient, therefore this potentially expensive information transfer need not be performed to migrate an actor.  On the other hand, there appears to be no alternative but to transfer the complete state of the components of the decision mechanisms if the actor may ever be reconstituted as a CGA.  The determination of whether to migrate the reasoning system’s history is somewhat more problematical.  Generally, the reasoning system history is required if the eventual recipient CGA must seamlessly continue with the actor’s performance and if the actor’s reasoning is explicitly dependent upon the reasoning history.  Therefore, a complete reasoning system history transfer only needs to be performed for a CGA-CGA migration.  Whenever there is an intervening HCA situation, there will be an incomplete reasoning system state description when the actor subsequently moves to computer control.  Therefore, the reasoning system history need not be transported in a CGA-HCA migration since having merely a portion of the history serves no purpose for future decision making.3.2	Suitcases Required for Each Type of Actor  MigrationTo support CGA-HCA migration, we must consider planned and unplanned migrations since each one has different information needs.  Planned CGA-HCA migrations have relatively straightforward information requirements, the mission description can be pre-positioned at the planned recipient, and at the appropriate time the actor state migrates along with the reasoning system’s state.  The prototypical situation for this type of migration is when the actor migrates to human control to provide a planned training opportunity for the human controller.  Time and network bandwidth are not issues for this type of migration since the migration can be conducted at any convenient time over any duration provided that the migration completes before the required migration completion time.  The challenge for executing a planned migration lies in completely communicating the current state of the mission, which amounts to transferring the changes to the mission that have occurred since the mission began.  The abstract of the mission description information is sent in the abstract mission suitcase, the contents of this suitcase are determined by saving the pre-positioned mission plan and then transmitting only those portions that have changed.Unplanned  CGA-HCA migrations require a rapid migration and it is imperative that the human controller rapidly assume effective control of the actor.  The prototypical situation for this type of migration occurs when a CGA encounters a situation that it can not deal with due to either a lack of information or gaps in its knowledge base.  The challenge in this type of migration is that the central aspects of a crucial situation must be transmitted and assimilated by a human within a short time period.  As in the planned migration situation, the actor state information, situation awareness, and reasoning system state suitcases must be transmitted.  However, in this unplanned CGA-HCA migration case, the reasoning system state transfer should be performed under the assumption that the actor will soon migrate again.  In the unplanned migration case, the mission may be affected because the human controller may execute re-planning actions.  In an unplanned CGA-HCA migration, we can safely assume that the period of operation by the human will be brief; therefore, there is no need to transport the mission suitcase before the human takes control.  The complete mission suitcase can follow later when a response is not time-critical or may even possibly be sent on to the next CGA recipient to receive the actor.  As noted previously, a major concern in conducting this type of migration is supporting the human operator’s rapid assimilation of the situation so that effective action can be taken rapidly.  The critical components of the solution are the contents of the situation awareness suitcase and techniques for rapidly and effectively communicating this information to the human operator.  There are three types of HCA-CGA migrations, those that follow a critical decision period, those that follow a key mission period (are so are planned), and those that are forced.  The migration after a critical decision period is the counterpart to the unplanned CGA-HCA migration.  For a critical decision period migration, we should assume that the human controller had complete access to the mission parameters and might have altered the actor’s mission.  As a result, the complete mission suitcase, the reasoning system suitcase (as migrated in), and the actor state information suitcases must be transported.  In our view, this type of migration provides a convenient means of achieving a desired training objective.  Since this type of migration has no timing criteria, the situation awareness suitcase is not needed because the computer controller will have the opportunity to assemble a situation assessment from the network traffic.  The migration after a key mission period is the complement of the planned CGA-HCA migration case.  In this type of migration, we must assume that some or all of the mission has changed, as a result the complete mission suitcase and the actor state information suitcase must be transmitted.  The reasoning system state suitcase is also required by the recipient, and should consist of the state that was initially transmitted into the human control situation.  There is no need to rapidly complete this migration, therefore the situation awareness suitcase does not need to be transmitted.  The forced migration case can occur for a number of reasons, such as when a human controller decides to migrate an actor to reduce the computational load on a computer.  Since the migration is not time critical, speed and situation awareness are not issues.  To support the forced HCA-CGA migration case, the actor state information, reasoning system state information (as transferred in), and the complete mission suitcase must be transmitted.There are two types of CGA-CGA migrations to consider, those that are planned and those that are unplanned.  The planned migration case is straightforward; it is essentially the same as the CGA-HCA planned migration case.  Since the migration is planned, the execution of the migration is not time critical.  We can assume that the mission for the actor is pre-positioned, so the abstract mission suitcase can be transmitted along with the actor and reasoning system suitcases.  To conserve bandwidth and minimize the impact of a migration on the simulation, the situation awareness suitcase is not transmitted.  There are two sub-cases for unplanned CGA-CGA migration, each is executed to support different causes and objectives.  A migration that is performed for fidelity purposes is one that is undertaken because the current host for an actor has insufficient computational power to provide a required level of fidelity for a phase of a mission.  A planned CGA-CGA migration allows an actor to acquire additional computational power when needed and conversely can reduce a host’s computational load.  Since the actor may have to migrate again and time is not necessarily an important issue, this type of migration requires that the actor state, reasoning system, and mission suitcases be transmitted.  On the other hand, an unplanned migration is performed for latency reasons and is undertaken when an actor or host recognizes that the transport delay exceeds specified tolerances.  In this circumstance, the amount of time required to perform the migration is an important issue since latency must be reduced as rapidly as possible.  Unfortunately, since the migration was unexpected, the mission information for the actor is probably not available at the recipient, which serves to increase the amount of time required to complete the migration since all four suitcases must be transmitted.  We believe that the best approach is to transmit the complete mission suitcase in two parts, the first part contains a description of the current portion of the mission, and hence should be relatively small and rapidly formed.  The second part would hold the description of the complete mission.3.3	Arrival BriefingWe borrowed the term arrival briefing from the intelligent agent literature, where an arrival briefing consists of providing the inbound agent with information concerning resources, other agents, IP address, and other information that the agent may request.  We advocate the same use for the arrival briefing for migrating CGAs.  In general, when a CGA migrates into a host it is unaware of the other entities at the site, the available resources, and the supported subscriptions.  To support all of the needs of the CGA and the host, we believe that an arrival briefing must be given by the CGA to the host and by the host to the CGA.  The briefing from the CGA to the host should consist of the desired subscriptions, necessary publications, latency, location of log files and other necessary files, and any other information required by the host.  The briefing from the host to the CGA consists of the telling the CGA the information stream it is assigned to, local resources and files, local agents, current subscriptions, and other information required by the arriving agent.4.	Suggested Changes to the HLA DocumentationAs part of the activities required to achieve HLA compliance for an application, a Simulation Object Model (SOM) must be constructed for each participating system and a Federation Object Model (FOM) must be constructed for the distributed virtual environment.  The FOM and the SOM are comprised of four tables and were formulated to document key information about the distributed simulation environment and applications.  The information in the tables includes the types of actors supported, the information that each actor is able to export to the DVE, the information each actor requires from the DVE, and the types of interactions supported by each actor.  The four tables also document the subscription requirements for the actors and actor superclasses and the information each actor and actor superclass can provide to a DVE via publication.  The four tables are the Object Class Structure Table, the Interaction Class Structure Table, the Attribute Table, and the Parameter Table. To aid in managing the information requirements imposed by the migration activity upon the software systems and computer hosts, we recommend that the four tables be augmented by a fifth table, called the Migration Table, shown in Table 4.1.General Object ClassDerived Object ClassMigration TypeInitiationCriteriaSuitcasesRequired AttributesCompletion TimeArrival BriefingAAAActor stateentity ID number, coordinates, velocity, acceleration, orientation, remaining rounds, remaining fuel, weapon, orientation, operational radar frequencies, operational radio frequencies, actor’s skill level(s), current fidelity level, the values for the actor’s combat psychology model, etc.1 secondCGA: subscriptions, publications, latency, etc.Host:  information stream, local agents, etc.Reasoning systemstate of the reasoning system and the decision historyPlanned   CGA-HCAWhen requiredMissionabstract mission  suitcase2 secondsUnplanned CGA-HCA300 ms latencySituation awarenessdetected entities, chaff, jamming, flares, integrated air defense system status, etc.CriticalHCA-CGAWhen requiredMissioncomplete mission suitcase2 secondsKey         HCA-CGA300ms latencyMissionabstract suitcase first followed by complete suitcaseForced         HCA-CGA300ms latencyMissionabstract suitcase first followed by complete suitcase2 secondsPlannedCGA-CGAAs requiredMissioncomplete suitcase2 secondsUnplanned, latency,CGA-CGASituation awarenessdetected entities, chaff, jamming, flares, integrated air defense system status,etc.Missionabstract suitcase first followed by complete suitcaseUnplanned, fidelity,CGA-CGA300 ms latencyMissionAbstract suitcase first followed by complete suitcaseZSU-23Table 4.1: Extract of an Example Migration Table for a AAA Actor.The migration table documents the types of migration supported by each actor class and actor, the conditions and criteria for the types of migration, the contents of each type of suitcase for each type of migration, the maximum allowed transport time for the migration, and the contents of the arrival briefing.  In keeping with the spirit of the other tables, inheritance is used within the migration table to ease the development of the documentation.  In our proposal for the migration table, we assume that all of the attributes required to execute a migration are defined within the Attribute Table.  For readability purposes, we did not include all of the attributes for the suitcases in the example table, and the ZSU-23 entry was inserted to illustrate the placement of the specific actor class information relative to the general actor superclass information.In Table 4.1, the far left column contains the entry for the actor superclass whose migration parameters are being described.  The second column holds the specific actors whose migrations need to be described.  The third column holds the entries for the specific type of migration that is to be specified.  Note that in addition to the type of interaction (CGA-CGA, HCA-CGA, CGA-HCA), we believe that the sub-type for each type should be specified since the timing requirements and data transport requirements may differ if the migration occurs at an unplanned time or is unplanned.  The fourth column lists the criteria for initiating a migration activity.  For a planned migration, the only parameter is the time that the migration should occur.  The fifth column lists the suitcases required by each type of migration.  Column six holds the specification of the data that must be transported in each suitcase to support the migration.  Column seven contains the specification for the maximum permitted elapsed time (end-to-end) for the migration.  The last column contains a description of the contents of the arrival briefing required by the actor and the arrival briefing required by the host.5.	ConclusionsAchieving robust actor migration is an important component of higher fidelity simulations for training and analysis because it will allow an actor to access human assistance and insure that it satisfies its fidelity and latency requirements during execution.  To guide the development of this capability we identified the three major types of actor migration, CGA-HCA, HCA-CGA, and CGA-CGA, and the major sub-types of migration for each of these types.  In the course of identifying the information requirements for each type and sub-type of migration, we identified four common pools of information, called suitcases, that in combination satisfy the information needs for each type and sub-type.  Because the quantity and type of information transferred in these suitcases is not well supported in the current FOM/SOM development process or tables, we recommend augmenting the set of tables with an additional table dedicated to documenting and managing migration.  This new table, called the Migration Table, documents all of the information associated with each type of migration for each superclass and class of actor.ReferencesBharat, K. & Cardelli, L.
