RPR FOM Meeting at SIW 99FOverview(Richard Schaffer)First time attending: 12GRIM Overview(Keith Briggs, Sean Reilly)RPR FOM Overview(Graham Shanks)Question: Why are entity object attributes not put in leaf nodes?General reason is to limit the number of classes needed to capture complete set of attributes covering DIS PDU data.  Specific reasons are historical (see reflector archives and minutes).Question: Why were there not more hierarchical classes in interactions?Interaction class table initially did not support inherited parameters. Later when inherited parameters were added to OMT, there was not enough motivation for separating interactions other than Radio (i.e., radio type filtering were useful).Discussion of DIS Enumeration for Entity Types: Graham reiterated his proposal to split FOM out into Enumeration part and Core part. As enumeration changes, only Enumeration part need change. There is the possibility of a DIS enumeration becoming an attribute. These cases would have to be documented.Question: Latest RPR FOM in document library has PDF but not OMD format. Graham will put out final standard after SAC decides on numbering scheme. If they do not come back quickly, Graham will put out a cleaned up draft with OMD format.RPR FOM 2.0 Status(Richard Schaffer)Volunteers:Frank Hill: IFF, supplemental Emission/Entity State, Transfer Control (Sean Reilly and Larry Rieger have a start on this PDU)Graham Shanks: SIMAN with ReliabilityDoug Wood: Synthetic Environment (point, linear and areal)Underwater Acoustics(Graham Shanks, Sean Reilly)Glenn Gross (or substitute) will review proposal.Presentation tabled for offline reviewIFF(Doug Wood)Presentation tabled for offline reviewFrank Hill will review proposal
