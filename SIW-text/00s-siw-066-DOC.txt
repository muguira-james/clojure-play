These physical properties are then used to predict a soil strength measurement (cone index).  The cone index calculation is used to predict trafficability measurements of wheeled and tracked vehicles.  The model predicts cone index as a function of moisture migration through a layered media at discrete time and spatial intervals.  The prediction is performed for intervals of 30 minutes or less. A relationship is given between soil strength in terms of cone index and soil type, moisture content by weight and soil density.  Soil strength is predicted to a depth of 30 centimeters at varying intervals.  The model includes algorithms for sorbtivity of the surface, migration of the wetness front, and runoff during non-freezing periods. The SOFT model is imbedded in a standalone program, Hydrosim.  The Hydrosim uses SOFT to modify soil strength and moisture content attributes in the compact terrain database within the semiautomated forces (SAF) model.  A model of a grizzly vehicle is created within the SAF, whose speed is modified by the changing soil strength.  The vehicle database is created from a high resolution mobility model entitled the NATO Reference Mobiilty Model.  This study illustrates a method of dynamically changing moisture content of the soil within the SAF, while effecting movment rates of a mineplow vehicle. IntroductionMobility and countermobility predictions for regional areas of the world require knowledge of terrain and the vehicle system.  The soil strength required to sustain traffic is one important aspect of the terrain [1].  The soil strength will change based upon the physical state of the soil or whether the soil is frozen or in some state of freezing/thawing [2].  The information on the strength of the soil in terms of Rating Cone Index (RCI) is then used to predict the maximum vehicle speed using existing traction models [3].  High-resolution combat models have been developed which require accurate predictions of a maximum vehicle speed as a function of terrain and weather  [4].  The HYDROSIM model developed in reference [4] used Environmental Change Notices (ECN) to dynamically modify terrain attributes related to trafficability.  This version of HYDROSIM worked with files output from ARC INFO which delineated saturated areas based on slope.  To this end, HYDROSIM categorized areas of the CTDB, defining areas in terms of their level of saturation during various weather conditions defined external to JointSAF. The HYDROSIM model was extended [5] to include a model that changed soil strength directly, as a function of changing weather conditions within the JointSAF 3.1.  The Short-Term Operational Forecasts of Trafficability (SOFT) model was developed to predict the changes in moisture content of the soil.  A particular requirement for SOFT included the need to provide soil strength information in order to model a mine plow vehicle.  This required predicting changes in soil strength with depth.  This provided information to predict both traction and plowing forces of the vehicle. The integration of a soil physics model SOFT into HYDROSIM provided predictive capability of continuous changes in soil conditions on the battlefield.  The SOFT was directed at the temporal and spatial resolution defined in JointSAF 3.1.  The algorithms developed in this study included unsaturated conditions of the soil.  The model did not include snow cover, frozen, freezing, or thawing ground.  Model FormulationTwo basic models were developed as a part of this study.  The first model (SOFT) was a soil physics           model, defining moisture changes of the soil with respect to long-term and short-term weather changes.  The SOFT model extended the model cited in Reference [2] to include hourly changes in the soil state.  The second model, a vehicle traction model, related the SOFT output to vehicle traction.  The output of SOFT was moisture content and soil strength (in terms of RCI) for the surface and subsurface layer.  This paper will detail the SOFT algorithms. The SOFT model formulation relates insitu soil strength variations to the physical properties of the soil (i.e., soil type, moisture content, overburden pressure and density of the soil).  An empirical relationship between soil moisture by weight and the bearing capacity of the soils as given by Rating Cone Index rating is given by Equation 2.1, see reference [2].	 EMBED Equation.3  	(2.1)where:	RCI	=	soil strength in terms of Rating Cone 			Index	a, b	=	coefficients specified for each USCS			soil type (Table 1)	m	=	moisture content (weight) of soilThe relationship between moisture content in weight and the dry density of the soil is given in Equation 2.2.	 EMBED Equation.3  	(2.2)where:	(w	=	dry unit weight of soil	(d	=	dry unit weight of water	S	=	percent saturationThe relationship of moisture content of the soil and dry density is given in Equation 2.3.	 EMBED Equation.3  	(2.3)where:	Vw	=	volume of water	VS	=	volume of solid (constant)Table 1Static Soil CoefficientsUSCS Soil Type(sks(ResidualMoistureSaturatedMoistureSDensity(lb/ft3)(dSoilStrengthaSoilStrengthbSW16.6.076201.8521.6034.7093.63.9870.8150SP16.6.076201.8521.6034.7093.63.9870.8150SM14.1.008612.3752.6040.8093.712.542-2.9550SC18.4.003842.6675.6041.9097.412.542-2.9550SM-SC17.2.004842.5974.8041.80100.512.542-2.9550CL33.5.000604.5053.6046.9086.815.506-3.5300ML33.9.000794.2022.6053.7073.711.936-2.4070CL-ML32.9.000084.2922.6046.8083.714.236-3.1370CH32.9.000385.2087.1047.5085.513.686-2.7050MH39.0.000044.8783.8054.7066.223.641-5.1910OL28.6.001223.8763.0062.7077.417.399-3.5840OH29.3.000884.2374.1089.2052.512.189-1.9420GM12.7.099803.2474.1043.80GC23.2.001744.0653.4045.20Water Budget RoutineThe expected minimum and maximum values of (d are given in Table 1 for various soil types.  The volume of water in the soil at any time is determined with a water budget routine as given in Equation (3.1).  	 EMBED Equation.3  	(3.1)where:	t	=	 time	d	=	distanceGiven a multi-layer system as shown in Figure 3.1 the volume of water at each interval can be computed as given in Equation 3.2.  Figure 3.1   Multi-layered Soil SystemEquation 3.2 splits the computations into three discrete computations.  The first computation is for the change in the volume of water in the surface layer.  The second computation for change in water volume can be subdivided into multiple layers.  The third computation represents the change in the volume of water in the nth layer where the drainage into the soil and out toward the water table is the only controlling factor.  The Sellers (see reference [6]) equation is modified in Equation 3.2 with the term d to account for varying of the soil. EMBED Equation.3  where:	Q	=	Flow through a layer (LT-1)	E	=	Evaporation at the near surface (LT-1)	R	=	Runoff of the surface Layer (L)The term (Q) accounts for flow between two consecutive layers of soil, including flow of water up or down in the system.  The highest value of the flow is restricted to the saturated permeability of the soil as given in Table 1.  The flow is a function of pressure and permeability of the soil.  The change in pressure between consecutive layers of soil controls the direction of the flow.  The change in flow between layers is given in Equation 3.3 as a function of relative permeability and pressure.	 EMBED Equation.3  	(3.3)where:	Kr	=	relative permeability (LT-1)	(	=	bubbling pressure head (L)The bubbling pressure can be measured in the field with a tensiometer and the saturated permeability with permeameter.  The relationship between moisture content, bubbling pressure, and permeability is given by Clapp and Hornberger [8] Equations 3.4 and 3.5, where the coefficients for ( are given in Table 1.	 EMBED Equation.3  	(3.4)	 EMBED Equation.3  	(3.5)where:	(	=	empirical coefficient from Table 1Rada et al. [7] used these relationships to address issues of migration of moisture in a road’s subgrade for purposes of defining seasonal road deterioration.  Boundary ConditionsThe Surface LayerFrom a mobility standpoint, the researchers are often concerned with only the surface layer of soil.  This is particularly true when we consider short-term forecasts of less than one day in a region where dry weather has prevailed.  When the precipitation events occur, slippery conditions on the surface reduce mobility considerably.  To predict surface slippery conditions, a Sorptivity term is introduced.  Sorptivity is a measure of the surface layers ability to absorb or de-absorb water.  Computation of the sorptivity of the surface layer will define the amount of water the soil will take in over small increments of time.  The equation for sorptivity as given by Clapp and Hornberger is shown in Equation 4.1.1 for a zero pressure problem.	 EMBED Equation.3  	(4.1.1)where: 	(	=	sorptivity at surface pressure of 0 			[LT-1/2]	S	=	saturationThe sorptivity is related to volume of water absorbed into the soil per unit time.  Equation 4.1.2 expresses sorptivity, permeability, and time as a function of flow through the surface.	 EMBED Equation.3  	(4.1.2)The Flow to the Water TableThe equation for the output flow Qr from the final layer is given by Equation 4.2 [6] Sellers et al. as:	 EMBED Equation.3  	(4.2)where: 	(	=	slope of the terrainThe slope for this equation is assumed based on digital elevation data.  Qr assumes the soil layer (r) extends to the water table.  Evaporation RateThe evaporation rate used for this model was designed around the input data available in the SAF environment.   The Penman model, given in Equation 4.3, appeared adequate for this experiment.	 EMBED Equation.3  	(4.3)where:	E	=	evaporation rate [L2T-1/2]	es	=	vapor pressure at the surface 	ed	=	vapor pressure at the current air 			temperature 	u2	=	wind velocity at 2m above the			ground [LT-1/2]	h	=	relative humidity ed/ea	ea	=	vapor pressure at the mean air			temperatureThe vapor pressure at the surface es is a function of S1 or the percent saturation of the surface.  The humidity at the atmosphere above can be modified to reflect the relative humidity.    For the purposes of the demonstration model developed in reference [5], an absolute evaporation rate was provided.  The default model used 10 percent of the available surface moisture for evaporation purposes.Rainfall-Runoff ModelingRunoff is a function of slope and vegetation. Runoff coefficients were used for rural areas (Singh, P., V., Reference [10]) as given in Table 2.  The coefficients are applied against the precipitation rate before interception of the ground.  Equation 4.4 gives the new precipitation rate.	 EMBED Equation.3  	(4.4)where:	P	=	precipitation rate (LT-1)	A	=	area of polygon	C	=	runoff coefficientModel ResultsA limited field test study was conducted to compare predicted versus measured cone index readings.  The site was located at Fort Leonard Wood.  The site included a weather station located on grass-covered       lean clay.  The slope was 1 percent.  Figure 5.1 illustrates the predicted moisture content for the top 3 cm of soil versus the measured moisture content by weight.  The measured readings were found to compare favorably to the predicted values.  The subsurface readings were taken between 7 cm and 12 cm.  Figure 5.2 illustrates these results.  The data appeared to oscillate; however, the predictions were near the measured readings.  In this study we located the water table at 40 cm which may have attributed to the oscillations in soil strength.SEDRIS DatabaseA review of the data entries in the SEDRIS database suggests that many input and output parameters are predefined.  Soil strength terms relative to trafficability (RCI) and other soil strength terms for engineering problems relative to roads, buildings, and plowing forces are also critical.  While permeability and soil pressure parameters are not present in the SEDRIS database, these parameters can be inferred based on the available soil types.Table 2Runoff Coefficients (After Singh, P.

The static parameters required to run this model are presented in Tables 1 and 2. These algorithms were developed and implemented to a SAF environment.  Traction algorithims were used in conjunction with the output of this model for realistic mobility predictions resulting from weather changes.The SEDRIS database supports many of the input and output parameters.  Soil strength, soil permeability and pressure are missing from the SEDRIS database.References[1]	Bekker:  “Introduction to Terrain-Vehicle Systems,” The University of Michigan Press, MI, 1969. [2]	P.
