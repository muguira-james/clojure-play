Several new sources for data were suggested by the attendees.  These sources will be investigated by either the person making the suggestion or the SCM SG chair.The need for a simulation conceptual modeling product remains high particularly in view of the dependencies the Base Object Model PDG and VV&A FEDEP Overlay PDG have for a simulation conceptual modeling product. Jean-Louis Igarza to present a brief on the SCM SG efforts to NATO M&S meeting in April 2005.A recommendation was made to draft a  presentation for the Fall 05 SIW as a final report for the study group.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)13Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)13Peak attendance (including joint sessions)n/aTotal papers presented1“No-show” presentationsn/aOther presentations and panel discussions0Recommended Reading List nominations (including previous nominations):1.  05S-SIW-106, “Simulation And Software Development for Capabilities Based Warfare: An Analysis of Harmonized Systems Engineering Processes”2005 SPRING SIW OUTBRIEF FORM
