Name of Forum or Group:  Open Source Initiative for Parallel and Distributed Modeling and Simulation (OSI-PDMS) Study GroupChairJeffrey S. SteinmanVice ChairNASecretaryNAObjectives for this Workshop:The objectives for this workshop were threefold. First, we wanted to introduce the basic goals of the OSI-PDMS working group and our current status. Second, we wanted to provide an introduction to some of the technical approaches used to support parallel and distributed discrete-event simulation. Third, we wanted to discuss issues relating to community involvement in open source use and software development. After the working group meeting, we were informed that the EXCOM approved our status as a new study group.Meeting Agenda (sent out a week before the SIW)Part I – Programmatic Discussion (1330 – 1500)IntroductionsStatus of the OSI-PDMS study groupGoals of the OSI-PDMS study groupGuidelines for how the OSI-PDMS should operateBreak (1500 – 1530)Part II – Technology Briefings (1530 – 1700)Review architecture and technology conceptsNext generation R&DComments and Recommendations:The first meeting was successful, despite not knowing our status and not knowing if we would actually meet until just a few weeks before the SIW. A number of proponents couldn’t make the meeting because of the short notice, travel budgets, and/or other conflicts. However, at least three people specially registered to the SIW just to participate in the OSI-PDMS meeting. Overall feedback from all participants was very positive. From discussions with others during the SIW (especially as a result of the Open Source Panel discussion), it would appear that there is much interest in our study topic.One suggestion that was mentioned during our meeting was that we might try to put a collection of three or six related papers together that could be presented in one or two sessions during the next workshop. An email was sent to everybody who has expressed interest in the OSI-PDMS study group to determine if this can be supported. Possible topics that relate to the OSI-PDMS are:Multicore computingTechnologies of parallel simulation (e.g., OpenMSA, JIMM, SPEEDES, etc.)Model composability (e.g., OSAMS)Issues involved in open source developmentOpen source reference implementationsOur next steps are (1) to continue outreach to communities other than SISO that have expressed interest in our topic (note, the OSI-PDMS study group currently contains 45 people in its mailing list – we hope to grow this list before the next SIW), (2) continue educating participants on the technologies and architecture concepts, and (3) canvassing the community for open source reference implementations and/or technologies that can support the community, and (4) determine how (or if) a community-wide open source development organization might be established to implement standards that may eventually be formed.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)14Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)16Peak attendance (including joint sessions)NATotal papers presentedNA“No-show” presentationsNAOther presentations and panel discussionsSee above agendaRecommended Reading List nomination: NA                 2007 FALL SIW OUTBRIEF FORM
