Name of Forum or Group:  Analysis ForumChairCam TranVice ChairJohn FaySecretaryEmmet BeekerObjectives for this Workshop:Explore new techniques, practices, and tools for Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis (MS&A).Familiarize the audience (in particular, the ANL Forum) with specifications under development at SISO, in particular, HLA Evolved and VV&A Overlay to FEDEP that are in their final stage of IEEE balloting.Comments and Recommendations:As always, joint sessions provide great synergy.  We have three joint sessions this Spring: ANL-RD&E (3 papers, Tuesday), ANL-T&E (1 paper, Tuesday), ANL-SMS COMPOSE (2 papers, Wednesday), ANL-VWS (2 papers, Wednesday).  We have several good papers this Spring: 033, 108, 003, 074 and 084 to name a few.  ANL decides to nominate 033, 108, and 003 for SIWzie awards; however, 074 and 084 are also worth mention.  Paper 074 presents conceptual modeling for the Probability of Raid Annihilation Testbed for the LPD 17 amphibious ship class that extends FEDEP.  Paper 084 describes a suite of applications that provides general TENA Logical Range Object Model (LROM) logging and playback capabilities supporting on MS Windows and Linux machines.  Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)24Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)38Peak attendance (including joint sessions)38Total papers presented14“No-show” presentations2Other presentations and panel discussionsNoneRecommended Reading List nomination: 07S-SIW-033 applies the framework presented in the draft “VV&A Overlay to the FEDEP”, currently in IEEE balloting, to identify core VV&A tasks defined in each step of the overlay and to implement to the Urban Resolve 2015 experiment.  The effort provides real-world feedback to the framework during its drafting phase. This seminal paper is a must-read.07S-SIW-108 provides an informative overview of the concept of  modular FOMs, a novel feature of HLA Evolved that is in the final phase of IEEE balloting. It is a must read paper for anyone who is interested in what’s new in the next generation of HLA.07S-SIW-003 presents the current implementation of the commander’s decision process in the APL Integrated Multi-warfare Simulation (AIMS) Commander Federate by employing an expert system and intelligent planner in integrated or stand-alone warfare areas to proactively construct a plan based on observed simulation events.  It is a must read.                 2007 SPRING SIW OUTBRIEF FORM
