Logistics and Enterprise Models (LOG) ForumChairDave PayneVice ChairDave ProchnowSecretaryPat JonesMemberCarroll KeyfauverObjectives for this Workshop:Explore relationship of asymmetric warfare M&S to Log M&S.Share new developments in Log modeling within the forum.Share new developments in crowd modeling within the forum, and discuss the need for crowd modeling in Log modeling, or the value of federating crowd models with Log models.Comments and Recommendations:The presentation on the Joint Operations Feasibility Tool (JOFT) led to discovery of an opportunity to discuss how JOFT could be federated with several other G2 based models that various government agencies are currently using and extending. This may be an opportunity to start a community of interest, and share knowledge gained working with G2 based models in an HLA federation. Specifically, JFCOM may be able to leverage the G2 HLA interface and federation developed for several other government sponsors.Need to expand the linkage between asymmetric warfare combat simulations with logistics, commercial supply chain, and homeland security simulations. Looks like a good opportunity to improve M&S support to all of these communities.Cougaar based environments appear to be attractive for logistics simulation in support of ops-log planning. Now that Cougaar societies have been federated using the HLA, it may be useful to model the operational logistics planning process in the Cougaar agent society, as the support operations federate, and then to execute the plan in a more conventional combat simulation, such as JMACE. (JMACE having recently been federated under another effort presented at this session). Deviations from plan or bad plans would then pay the price in the war fight simulation, and feedback could flow to the Cougaar planner to replan and adjust to emerging conditions or opposition actions.Crowd simulation is an important aspect of simulating both asymmetric warfare and logistics operations, but is currently a major capability gap. Different types of crowd models are needed: crowd scattering, crowd fleeing, crowd forming/attraction, crowd behavior-- reaction and interaction.Average attendance (excluding joint sessions)22Peak attendance (excluding joint sessions)34Peak attendance (including joint sessions) (no joint sessions)34Total papers presented8“No-show” presentations0Other presentations and panel discussions0Recommended Reading List nominations (including previous nominations):04S-SIW-133 – “Design of an Agent-Based Logistics Simulation Tool for the Future Combat Systems Unit of Action”, Daniel Cerys04S-SIW-072 – “Developing a Crowd Federate for Military Simulation”,          Dr. Mikel D.
