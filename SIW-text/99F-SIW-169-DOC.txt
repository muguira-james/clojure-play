The project specifically supports the M&S Master Plan goal to provide authoritative representations of the environment, systems, and human behavior in a shared/reusable format. The objective of the ADS project is to catalog all of the data sources within DoD that can be used to support Modeling and Simulation.  The intent is to use the catalog to expedite the search process that occurs with each M&S development and/or implementation event.   DMSO established an Authoritative Data Source Working Group in 1994.  The working group defined the terminology commonly associated with the project and developed a taxonomy of 13 top level and 373 sub-categories by which to catalog the sources.  The effort to identify, catalog and designate M&S began in April 1996 and has to date collected a standard set of metadata for each of 1061 sources. The metadata, intended to expedite the knowledge acquisition phase of either model development or application, is available today on the Modeling and Simulation Resource Repository (MSRR) unclassified http://ads.msrr.dmso.mil/ and classified http://207.85.140.168. The library supports a very robust key word or category search capability and a number of reports can be obtained from the database. Distributed libraries of information resources have become more prevalent recently.  The ADS WG has developed a standard metadata collection template for data sources based on DoD and International standards which facilitates efficiently searching seamlessly between libraries  across the internet.1. IntroductionThe value of models and simulations is directly correlated to their representation of real environments and systems.  Locating and acquiring the correct Knowledge (data/information) is paramount to that capability.  The Authoritative Data Source (ADS) project was initiated by the Defense Modeling and Simulation Office (DMSO) to provide the Department of Defense (DoD) Modeling and Simulation (M&S) community with a listing of government and commercial data producers and repositories with levels of authority assigned to each.  DMSO has been directed by the Deputy Secretary of Defense in accordance with DoD Directive 5000.59-P (Modeling and Simulation (M&S) Master Plan) to strengthen the use of M&S in the three functional areas: training; analysis; and acquisition.  The ADS project specifically supports the DoD M&S Master Plan goals and objectives in that it deals with; complex data modeling and simulation for scientific and technical application, verification, validation, and accreditation (VV&A), and reuse.2. BackgroundThe effort to satisfy the goals of the M&S Master Plan were initiated by DMSO in February 1994 with the establishment of the Authoritative Data Sources (ADS)  Work Group (WG).  The ADSWG consists of  Service and Agency modeling and simulation office representatives, Executive Agent representatives, and other prominent personnel interested in M&S data representations.  The working group developed the Taxonomy of Data Categories (13 top-level categories, figure 1, and 373 sub-categories not shown), each with a specific definition.    Figure 1. Top Level TaxonomyThey also defined the terminology and responsibilities of those involved in the production and maintenance of data.  The metadata collection effort, contracted to Veridian Engineering, commenced in April 1996 with the contact of appropriate Joint, Service, and Agency Offices of Primary Responsibility.  The initial population of the ADS Library will continue through FY99, funded by DMSO.DMSO projects that by the end of FY99 a core database of sources will be completed. FY99 efforts will expand the metadata set collected to include additional data quality information. The responsibility for continuing maintenance and database administration beyond FY99 will shift to the Modeling & Simulation Information Analysis Center, an activity to be stood up in  FY99.  FY99 will also bring an on-line registration capability.3. GoalsThe over arching goals of the project are to improve the capabilities of the Department of Defense and to support the decision making process that leads to that capability.  Figure 2 represents data as the foundation on which the ultimate result depends.                                      Figure 2.  Importance of DataThe Objectives of the DoD M&S Master Plan define the goals for the ADS Project. Specifically, Objective 5-3 mandates the development of a directory of authoritative data sources. Objectives 2, 3, and 4, provide the ADS project scope, in that they outline the need for authoritative representations of natural environments, systems, and human behaviors.  The Master Plan further specifies that those representations must support joint training, development of doctrine and tactics, formulation of operational plans, assessment of warfighting situations, technology assessment, system upgrade, prototyping and full-scale development, and force structuring.  3.1. Four Phases to meet the GoalsDMSO has structured the ADS project (figure 3) to meet the goals of the M&S Master Plan.  The four steps to provide representations to the M&S community are:Identify the sources.  This phase will be a continuous process as requirements for new types of information are defined.  This phase started by contacting senior Service and Agency modeling and simulation offices for prioritized listings of their sources. The search was expanded by (1) Obtaining inputs from major users, (2) Asking identified points of contact to identify other sources, and (3) Search of U.S. Government, Military, Commercial, and Foreign web pages.Gather a standard set of information.  The standard set of metadata being gathered was developed and approved by the ADSWG. The focus is on providing the information required during the knowledge acquisition phase of any model development or employment.  The content of the ADS metadata has been cross-walked with International Standards Organization and the Federal Geographic Data Committee standards for metadata, and with the Defense Data Dictionary System for consistency.Designate each source with a level of Authority. This is a critical piece of the effort.  It provides the users with the information necessary to confirm appropriateness of the data for the need.  Designations are assigned by the Components responsible for the creation of the information.  Those not related to a specific Service or Agency are designated by an ADSWG joint consensus. Previous levels of authority were:  Authoritative, Approved (for a specific purpose), and Other.  The DoD Components have approved a change of the designation levels to Category I, II, or III with modifications to the respective definitions. The definitions are provided later in this paper.  Make information readily available to the M&S community.  The value of the information lies in its use to reduce the knowledge acquisition time.  The library is available to the M&S community via the Modeling and Simulation Resource Repository (MSRR). 4. The ProcessInitial direction for the project was to attack the task from the top down, requesting the senior Model and Simulation representative of the Services, Agencies, and Executive Agents (EAs)  provide a list of prospective sources to DMSO.  DMSO requested that the lists be prioritized to focus early metadata collection efforts on those sources that were most likely authoritative in nature. In FY97 a second direction was added.  DMSO requested major users within the community to identify the sources they were currently using and requirements they had that were not being adequately met, a bottom up approach. This bottom-up approach also provided the potential for early rewards from the project by identifying sources that would meet current shortfalls.  Both top-down and bottom-up approaches have identified a large number of sources.  These two approaches were supplemented by independent research by the Veridian Engineering team performing the task.  This phase continues today as the Service and Agencies expand their efforts to identify sources.Each identified source is contacted to initiate the metadata collection effort, if it is determined to be beneficial, on-site briefings to more clearly explain the project are conducted.  The standard set of information (Metadata) is collected on each source. In addition to gathering the required set of metadata, responsibilities, definitions of data sources and data centers, and development of guidelines for verification, validation, and accreditation (VV&A) are discussed and how they pertain to M&S.  Veridian compiles the resulting information into a report, updates the ADS Library, Figure 4, and provides the information to DMSO at six month intervals.The ADS Library is developed in a Microsoft Access application format.  The ADS Library is available to M&S community users via the Modeling and Simulation Resource  Repository  (MSRR).    The   unclassified  URL   address  is: http://ads.msrr.dmso.mil/ and the classified URL is 207.85.140.168.  Figure 5 is an IDEF depiction of the ADS database.The designation process begins with DMSO reviewing the information collected for completeness.  Sources are sorted by Component.  The full metadata and a brief assessment is then provided to each Component for its respective sources. Each Component has established its own procedure for determining the appropriate designation.  Designations are returned to DMSO for  input  into  the  ADS Library. Sources  that  are not clearly identifiable as belonging to a specific Component or are non-DoD   or   commercial   sources   are   sent   to       a  all Components with interest in the respective data area.  If different levels of authority are assigned by different Components the ADSWG will resolve the difference and assign the authority to be placed on the source in the library, with appropriate comments included in the source description in the library. Previously three levels of authority were being assigned; Authoritative, Approved, and Other.   The definitions of each are provided here.Authoritative Data source: A source or product which has undergone producer data VV&C activities.  Organizational has the mission to develop the dataset.Approved Data Source: A source or product that has been generated for a specific purpose and has been reviewed by the proponent and user and they agree to its validity and appropriateness for that use.Other Data Source: A source or product that is not Authoritative or Approved but is available for use as appropriate.As mentioned earlier modifications of the levels and associated definitions have been staffed and approved.  The new levels and definitions are:Category I – A recognized Service or National data production center with applicable mission statement, industry provider, or source/product that has established and documented production quality control procedures and quality controls the data produced.  These organizations or sources/products have a reliable performance history.  They have well-defined data metrics and significant metadata information, sufficient to satisfy all priority one Data Quality Template requirements (ADS mandatory metadata fields), available according to a recognized metadata standard.Category II – A data producer or source/product designated by a Component.  Includes data providers and sources/products that, while not of the Category I stature, have become de facto providers of data or have unique, one-of-a-kind data sets, and employ quality control procedures. This category includes providers of individual data sets that have been accepted or designated as research grade data sets.  The category may also include industry providers who establish Component-approved M&S support systems. Their data may or may not have well defined data metrics, and their metadata only partially satisfy the Data Quality Template priority one requirements (ADS mandatory metadata fields).Category III – A producer, source, or product that is not Category I or Category II but is available for use as deemed appropriate by the user.T suffix  -  Indicates source had been previously designated at the comparable level in accordance with the previous designation categories and definitions.  However, the metadata set requires completion of applicable new data quality elements of information and subsequent review by the designating authority to ensure the level is still appropriate.  It is envisioned that this will occur with the routine update/review schedule of each source.5. ADS “Use-Cases”The product of the ADS Project can be effectively utilized to reduce the knowledge acquisition phase during both model development and application.  A Conceptual Model of the Mission Space (CMMS) developer interested in capturing the necessary aspects of the Army’s involvement in logistics over the shore to support campaign air interdiction can use the ADS tool to locate and access the doctrinal sources both Joint and Service to understand the concepts.  He would enter the ADS database and search for logistics, logistics over the shore, or more specific key words.  The search would return all data sources that are specifically related to the key words, showing the level of authority associated with each.  The list would contain documents, subject mater experts, and instance data sources.  The CMMS developer would be most interested in the doctrine and then the SMEs  to further explain the application of the doctrine.  He would click on one of the sources listed, as an example Joint Pub 4-01.6 Joint Tactics Techniques, and Procedures for Joint Logistics over the Shore (JLOTS), and would be provided the metadata on that specific source.  If that metadata tells the developer that this source does contain pertinent information to his task he can click on the hypertext link and be taken to the Joint Electronic Library where he can read the actual publication and acquire a printed copy if necessary.  After reading the doctrine the developer could return to the source metadata and if necessary contact the POC for the development of the doctrine for further detail. His next step would be to go back to the search results and look for Army doctrinal documents and further to identify Subject Matter Experts to provide sufficient detail to the CMMS abstraction.  In this instance he would be pointed at the Army’s Standard Category Coordinator – Logistics, Mr. Ron Fischer at USA CASCOM. On the other end of the spectrum an analyst developing a database for a specific model run would want instance data for force structure information and consumption rates for the equipment involved in the JLOTS.  His keyword search on force structure would provide a listing of data sources containing information on force structure.   Figure 6 is a screen capture example of the metadata of one of the sources, Convention Forces Data Base (CFDB), that would appear. Not all sources in the ADS library will take you to the end data.  Release of the data is controlled by the data producer or repository and many require an approval process. CFDB is such a case. The developer is provided metadata about the content of the source and in-depth information on Points of Contact and how to acquire the information in an expeditious manner.  The analyst also requires instance data on consumption rates.  Referring back to his logistics search he would find the Logistics Planning Factors Data Bases - (Operational) identified. The metadata explains that it is a combination of model and underlying databases. The databases contain Army DCSLOG certified usage and consumption factors, TO&Es and scenario modifiers. The model queries the user for the specific force and operational information and then using the information calculates the planning values for each class of supply, except water and mail.  The analyst could then contact the POC and acquire OPLOGPLN or if only a small amount of data was required he could arrange to acquire the specific instance values. 6. Current StatusThe ADS Library that is available today contains 1061 sources.  The designation process for the last update of the database is still in progress, however, to-date the database contains 425 Category I, 202 Category II, 30 Category III, 17 SMEs and 19 Organizations, with 368 still in progress. Additional sources are identified almost everyday with the current list of sources to be investigated for possible inclusion into the database standing at 862.   The current library supports alphabetical and alphabetical by Taxonomy category search.  A number of reports can be obtained  from  the  database  to expedite the search for a specific level of authority or sources of a particular Component.  Figure 7 provides a listing of those reports and a short definition of each. The library also supports a very robust key word or category search capability. In the near future the library will support on-line registration of new sources and the maintenance/modification of registered sources.7. Metadata Standards & SearchingDistributed M&S MSRR libraries of information resources have become more prevalent recently.  The ADS WG has developed a standard metadata collection template for data sources based on DoD and International standards which facilitates efficiently searching seamlessly between libraries across the internet.The success of efficient seamless search between libraries is based on ensuring that all Components with information resource libraries were in total agreement on the content and naming of the metadata fields.  Because of the various databases being used in the repositories, this standardization process was extremely important for searching. Once the Components agreed on the standard metadata the cross-walking between libraries is easily  accomplished to facilitate search routines and locating data without major structural changes within the various repositories.  To evaluate the concept of efficient cross-site search, at the request of DMSO, the Institute for Simulations and Training (IST) at the University of Central Florida conducted a demonstration of the feasibility of direct repository-to-repository search.  The demonstration was extremely successful and only took minutes to provide results.  For more details on the demonstration see SIW paper 99F-SIW-168 titled “MSRR Interoperability Demonstrations Using the ADS-MEL Metadata Template”.8. ConclusionUse of models and simulations in the operational, acquisition, testing, research and development, and training environments will continue to expand.  The Authoritative Data Source Project is a key piece in DMSO’s efforts to provide tools that will contribute to a dramatic reduction in the time and resources devoted to Knowledge Acquisition, while helping to improve interoperability and assure a high degree of fidelity with the real world.9.
