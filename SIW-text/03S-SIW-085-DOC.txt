IntroductionThis paper addresses the implementation of the VV&A process as it applies to the 7-Step FEDEP, which is documented in IEEE P1516.3™ Draft Recommended Practice for High Level Architecture (HLA) Federation Development and Execution Process (FEDEP). The VV&A process is depicted as an overlay that aligns conveniently with the FEDEP. This approach not only matches the VV&A effort to the development effort so that exit criteria between steps can be tracked and measured, but also supports easier adoption, tailoring, and leveraging within each step.  This is a new representation of the VV&A process that is designed to be more efficient than previous versions and not as subject to variations in the FEDEP itself because the VV&A and development processes move forward together, have many common objectives, and share many development artifacts, tools, and data.  This also facilitates improved incremental evidence gathering by the V&V personnel in support of the Accreditation Decision.  Overall, the advantages of the new VV&A process model include improved planning and estimating, easier deployment, enhanced practitioner satisfaction, more predictable and accurate results, and reduced program risk.            1.1  General Planning InformationThe VV&A process is a natural adjunct to any system or simulation (a system of systems) development process.  Verification and validation support, expedite, and enhance proper system development ,as well as ensure that and the requirements for the accreditation decision are naturally included in system simulation acceptance testing.   Planning for federation system VV&A is an intuitive extension of FEDEP planning, and should be considered an integral part of program initiation.   While system development actually begins with the identification of an operational need or support deficiency, The federation sponsor must decide when to begin the V&V process.  Tthe earliest logical time to initiate formal VV&A is during the system FEDEP planning phase, concurrently with the development of the during the creation of the Needs Statement.  In the Needs Statement, t that requires the sponsoring organization (proponent or federation system sponsor) and user to define clearly state their requirements and generate the Objectives Statement, which defineswhich defines the general set of capabilities and boundaries the federation system must to have to satisfy the problem or need..  Once this is doneneeds are formalized, the sponsoring organization will beginbegins the process of determiningto determine whether if an existing federationsystem can satisfy these needs, either as-is or with modification and how much modification can be expected, o, or if a new one will have to be developed..  Even when a new federation is required, it will likely reuse parts of other federations or reference federation object models (FOMs), networking and communication services, terrain databases, synthetic environment, and many other components from other federations.  The decision to develop a federation instead of a stand-alone simulation is based on the magnitude of the system required by the Needs Statement and described by the Objectives Statement.  Given the decision by the sponsor that a federation is needed, the development team (including sponsor, developer, and user) will then need to determine the types of assets needed by each federate and the way the overall federation will portray the simulated exercise, test, or experiment.  In other words, the team needs to postulate the conditions, locations, and forces that will be simulated by each federate and develop a general idea of the types and complexity of their interactions.  This allows them to begin defining, at a high level of aggregation, the types of objects to be exchanged and the federation support systems that will exchange them, enabling them to add needed participants in the FEDEP.  These federation-directed activities are a good way to begin FEDEP planning (schedule, available resources, needed budgets, etc.).Once the decision to develop a federation is made, the team must then consider subordinate issues, such as reusing parts of existing systems and establishing priorities for integrating each without change.  Traditional reused components include reference object models [federation (FOMs), meta-FOMs, reference FOMs (e.g., the Real-Time Platform Reference FOM), simulation (SOMs), or Base Object Models (BOMs)], networking and communication services, and  representations of the natural environment and human behavior.Whenever an existing federation is involved, the sponsor and developer initiate the necessary steps to obtain the software, documentation, input databases, hardware descriptions, network and communication descriptions, configuration management records, and all the other support items needed to modify, install, and run the federation.  While this is taking place, the planning continues to fill in the details, the user requirements are formalized, and the ideas for a FEDEP Execution Plan and scenario begin to take form.  A rough estimate is made concerning how much of the old federation will need to be changed.Whenever In very rare cases, the development team may decide to build a new federation from the bottom up rather than altering an existing one or reusing major portions of existing ones.a new federation is involved, In this case, the user and sponsor or proponentdevelopment team begins by conceptualizing the new federation, identifying the major force elements and participants required, and evolving the plan for how the federation will be used to address the user’s problem as defined in the Needs Statementrequirements in the Objectives Statement. The concurrent development and VV&A processes require proper documentation of the criteria used to determine the acceptability of "borrowed" or reused components of existing federations.     As the general form and description of the federation begins to take shape, other federations are examined to determine what can be “borrowed” and reused in the new one (potentially altering the decision to build new).  This tends to reduce engineering time required to solidify the requirements and establishes a higher degree of confidence that primary objectives of the new federation can be met.  Once this information is collected, the team has enough information to formalize an initial FEDEP plan.   All new federations are indeed rare.  More typically, the development team will decide to alter an existing federation or form a new one by merging major portions of two or more existing ones. In this case, the development team initiates the necessary steps to obtain all software, documentation, input databases, hardware descriptions, network and communication descriptions, configuration management records, and other support items needed to modify, install, and run the federation.  Procurement and assessment of this complete set of documentation is an important part of both the development and VV&A processes.   Once these documents are available, the development team is in a good position to lay out the initial FEDEP plan.  While reused federation components save time in the FEDEP process, they In either case just described, this is the best time to initiate the V&V effort.  Typically, one of two paths is followed: the sponsor plans the V&V effort and brings on the V&V Agent, or it brings on the V&V Agent to assist in planning its own program.  Either way, the sponsor and the V&V Agent work together to define what is needed—resources, schedule, recommended V&V activities, relative scope and depth of the effort, etc.  Cost estimates and budgets are negotiated and the draft V&V Plan can be generated.  This document is designed to assist the planners in developing a cost-effective, yet comprehensive VV&A effort.  Federations should only be considered when it is not possible to address or solve the defined problem with stand-alone simulations.  Thus, the decision to go to a federation is usually one of magnitude.  Assuming that the user and sponsor know with certainty that a federation is required, it is then a matter of deciding what types of assets are needed on both sides, how the exercise, test, or experiment will be carried out.  In other words, the planners need to postulate the conditions, locations, and forces that will be simulated and roughly how they will interact, but only in general terms.  The reason for this is to begin defining for the types of units that will be required, support systems, etc. so that some idea of the participants can be formed, but still at a high level of aggregation.  These same planning activities must happen whether the federation is new or reused.  These studies determine the feasibility of the FEDEP planning, schedule, resources, budgets, etc.  In the reuse exampleshould be treated as new components in the VV&A process.,  Al even though there is some user experience with the federation component and perhaps some VV&A history,.,  t the original intended use, specified scenario(s), and mix of forces are likely towill  be different enough fromthat the previous implementationevent that those results do not have much influencpreevious VV&A efforts, which may still be relevant, must be repeated.  In any case, the integration of this existing component would necessarily contain new interfaces thatwhich must be verified and validated.  Therefore, in planning the VV&A program, tThe entire effort (including reused components) should be scoped should be treated as if it were a new program, and only later modified to recognize the extent to which earlier V&V efforts can be leveraged. from the VV&A standpoint, since   In the planning process, the V&V Agent must be guided by the V&V Agent has antheir inherent obligation to ensure assure the sponsor that the integrated federationproduct meets its needs, requirements, and criteria for Accreditation.  These areThis situation highlights the most fundamental reasons for VV&A of any simulation.  It is—VV&A is not performed not to check a box at the end of some uncontrolled or limited-control test runs, indicating that indicate that the product is "acceptable"; rather, it is performed to prove with sufficient evidence andto little a predetermined level of confidencedoubt that, by the end of development and testing, the federation is credible and acceptable to use for its intended purpose.  Regardless of whether a system is built entirely new or reuses existing components, the VV&A aspects of these initial (and often pre-FEDEP) planning steps suggest the early identification of the VV&A team and its critical activities.  Typically, one of two paths is followed:  either the sponsor plans the VV&A effort and brings on appropriate personnel, or the sponsor identifies the V&V and Accreditation Agents, who assist in identifying their own requirements.  Either way, the sponsor and VV&A personnel work together at the earliest possible time to clarify  required resources, schedule, recommended VV&A activities, relative scope and depth of the effort, etc.   They negotiate cost estimates and budgets, and begin to draft key parts of the VV& A Plans.  In allocating FEDEP resources, the developer should plan for The majority of the V&V activities should be performed at a medium-to-high level of efforts for VV&A activities across the entire FEDEP development project, unless development theactivities or outside analysis and evaluation effortsy can be leveraged from or extended to include one or more FEDEP-specific VV&A activitiesdevelopment or outside analysis and evaluation efforts.  In the identification and designation of VV&A personnel, the sponsor may encounter some very real resource limitations.  It is important to note that, in the following process, personnel identified as part of the VV&A team may actually perform multiple roles.  Use of "V&V Agent", "Accreditation Agent," and so forth is intended to clarify the particular role that a person or group would play in the process, rather than indicate the need for additional personnel.  Nonetheless, it is advisable that the Accreditation Authority be separate in order to facilitate that independent examination of results which adds credibility and reliability to the Accreditation Decision.To execute the V&V Plan efficiently and effectively, the V&V Agent must review, assess, and report to the sponsor on the entire federation modification or development process.  These reviews and assessments even question some of the early assumptions concerning how the federation will be used and if proposed changes or new development will be truly adequate for the intended application.  Thus, a good deal of interaction can be expected among the sponsor, user, and developer, and the V&V Agent.   1.12  Planning the Accreditation EffortSince accreditationthe establishment of credibility and user confidence through V&V is an essential part ofis the ultimate reason for all federation V&Vaccreditation activities, accreditation planning begins earlier than V&V planning, scopes its effort, and serves asprovides its foundation.  An in-depth examination of thea federation Accreditation Decision for a federation under development provides the structure for the Accreditation Plan and for the V&V Plan that must support it.Since accreditation is the ultimate reason for all federation V&V activities, accreditation planning begins earlier than V&V planning, and serves as its foundation.  An in-depth examination of the Accreditation Decision for a federation under development provides the structure for the Accreditation Plan and for the V&V Plan which must support it.The The Accreditation Decision is driven by degrees of acceptability based on risk and expediency.  The Decision, in turn, drives many design and development decisions.  For example, a flight simulator used to train pilots must be extremely high fidelity and “fly” precisely like the real airplane if negative cockpit training is to be prevented.  Conversely, a constructive force-on-force simulation can accept less-than-optimal visual representations and rather crude models of some of its supporting components, yet still be most useful for analysis or high-level training.  Given this reality, it is highly recommended that the Accreditation team (Accreditation Authority and Accreditation Agent) be identified as early as possible in the FEDEP,  so that the team may begin identifying the requirements for the Accreditation Decision and using those requirements as a guide for their efforts within the FEDEP.Although many people in the M&S Community think of Accreditation as just the Accreditation Decision, a singlen event at the end of a development process thatwhich that either accepts or rejects a systemthe federation as adequate for its intended usepurpose, there is much more to it than thataccreditation is actually a comprehensive process, more extensive for a federation than for a stand-alone system.  In the first placeIn any discussion of it, one should recognize the principal steps thatwhich are also part of the accreditation process for a single simulation.  Since, Accreditation of federations is different that it is for a single simulation since  a federation hasthere are many more stakeholders, its accreditation process may require additional activities, less-stringent decision criteria with a federation and there is a little more latitude in , the decision processand closer coordination with the development team and V&V Agent to precisely determine what the federation must do to meet Accreditation Decision requirements for credibility and acceptability.  It must be flexible enough to , allowing certain component features or functions to be accepted with constraints as long as they do not adversely impact the end results of the federation execution.  But perhaps most important is thatThus, accreditation needs to be recognized as a comprehensive process thatwhich Accreditation beginss  very quite early in the life cycle of the federationthe FEDEP.  It needs to be initiated formally no later than the time at which when the Needs Statement is being drafted, preliminary development plans are being craftedmade, and the objectives of the federation are being generated.  Accreditation is initiated when the sponsor and primary Often, the first step in the accreditation process is designation ofusers decide the which person who will serve as the Accreditation Authority.  This is the person who will sign the Accreditation Decision letter or statement that either accepts or rejects the federation as acceptable for its intended purpose, and states any caveats or constraints related to use of the federation.  Once the Accreditation Authority is determinedthat happens, the next accreditation activity is to assemble a group ofone or more experts in the various disciplines and systems that are included in the federation who will serve as reviewers of the evidence gathered throughout the development and testing of the federation.  This group, collectively termed the Accreditation Agent,ey will offer their advice, analysis, and expert opinion to the Accreditation Authority to help guide his or her the Accreditation Ddecision.  This group is commonly referred to as the Accreditation Agent.  In turn, the Accreditation Agentthey reliesy heavily on the V&V Agent to gather the necessary evidence during the development and integration of the federation.  As an entity in the VV&A process, tThe team of experts comprising the Accreditation Agent willconvenes early in formation and planning of the federation as stated above and  generates the acceptabilityance criteria  that will be used at the end of development to determine the adequacy, and credibility, and appropriateness of the federation.  Final approval of these criteria may wait untilFinalization of the acceptance criteria may wait until after the Conceptual Model is validated in the next step,  but team involvement begins before development of the federation cConceptual mModel.  Once appropriate acceptability criteria have been approved, Tthe Accreditation Agent usually only re-convenesmay only participate in for key project reviews and near the end of developmentthe FEDEP, leaving the routine analysis, assessment, and evidence gathering to the V&V  Agent.  Without tContinuedhis  involvement, by the Accreditation Agent is necessary to ensure that the Accreditation team well migthe team isht  not surprised by numerous or serious pfind a number of surprises roblems at the end of the program development process that would be very difficult to resolveconcile.  Continued involvement enables them to work with the V&V AgentWhen some of these criteria are not fully met, it may still be the recommendation of V&V Agent and the Accreditation Agent  to identify emerging difficulties in meeting acceptability criteria, assess the impact of these difficulties, and determine whether to recommend uuse of athe problematic federation or component, anyway as long aprovideds the users fully understandare fully apprised of the constraints and risk of so doing so.  Thus, the majority of the federation may be adequate, while a few things may notIt may be that the greater part of the federation satisfies acceptability criteria, while certain less-essential components may fail them.  Involvement of the Accreditation Agent in the FEDEP enables it to conduct all necessary investigations on the utilityThe final decision  of the federation, including those portions thatwhich fail to satisfy acceptability criteria.  Their work is an essential input to the Accreditation Decision, which on these matters is left to the Accreditation Authority.  Development of appropriate acceptability criteria is critical to the proper development of the federation.  In determining these, it is not uncommon to borrow measures of performance and effectiveness (MOPs and MOEs) from the real systems being simulated.  Such MOPs and MOEs form a part of the core set of criteria, but are not sufficient in themselves.  In reality, all the factors that will make the federation suitable and appropriate for use are candidates for inclusion as acceptability criteria.  The development and selection of appropriate acceptability criteria are not easy tasks, yet identification of those to be used in a federation creates the backbone and driving force throughout the reuse, development, or integration of the federation.  The V&V Agent tracks these criteria throughout the program development process to ensure that sufficient evidence is collected, retained, and analyzed for transfer to the Accreditation team to support its decision.It is recommended that the Accreditation Agent generate a written Accreditation Plan. This plan is typically a short document that defines the Accreditation team, its objectives, interfaces with other groups such as the V&V Agent and any external test and evaluation organizations, all stakeholders in the accreditation process, expectation of the Accreditation and V&V teams, accreditation activities and schedule, the listing of acceptability criteria for the federation, etc.   It should include requirements for its review; a listing, relative to the program timeline, of self-evaluations of the Accreditation program; and requirements for risk assessment if the program timeline changes or is anticipated to change.The relationship between the Accreditation Agent and the V&V Agent must be one of trust.  This is necessary so that, by the end of the FEDEP, the Accreditation Agent knows with certainty the limitations and constraints of the federation and the degree to which it satisfies each of the acceptabilitynce criteria.  The Accreditation Agent can then prepare its position to present to the Accreditation Authority concerning the suitability and credibility of the federation for its intended use.The importance of the Accreditation Decision cannot be overemphasized.  The requirement for the Accreditation Decision to be a separate activity occurring at the very end of the FEDEP (and The reason the Accreditation Decision is supposed to occur before the federation is used officially for an exercise, demo, test, or other purposeany purpose), is that it allows any concerns and limitation discovered in during the Accreditation test seriesprocess can either beto be fixed if minor, waived and noted if not critical, or stated as constraints in the Accreditation Decision.  The Accreditation Decision must list any identified caveats on the use of the federation—limiting or even prohibiting its use under certain circumstances or for particular purposes.   Close coordination between the Accreditation Agent, the V&V Agent, and the developer provides the best protection against the existence of serious deficiencies thatwhich would result in significant limitations or complete prohibition on the use of a developed federation.  In other words, the Accreditation Decision can have caveats on the use of the federation for certain things.  Serious deficiencies can even result in postponement of an event that uses the federation while they are being corrected.  This is usually not the case since during development most of the critical show-stoppers are discovered both by the developer and the V&V Agent.  This is also a strong reason to have adequate V&V support throughout the development of the federation.   The relationship between Accreditation Agent and the V&V Agent must be one of trust so that the Accreditation Agent knows with certainty by the end of the program what the limitations and constraints of the federation really are and how good it is.  The Accreditation Agent can then prepare its position to present to the Accreditation Authority concerning the suitability and credibility of the federation for its intended use.  There are degrees of acceptability based on risk and expediency that drive the Accreditation Decision that cannot be taken lightly.  For example, a flight simulator used to train pilots must be extremely high fidelity and “fly” precisely like the real airplane, else serious consequences will result.  Conversely, a constructive force-on-force simulation can have less than optimal visual representations and rather crude models of some of its components, yet it can still be useful for analysis or high-level training.  Because of these and other factors, it is highly recommended that the Accreditation team be formed as early as possible and work together with the federation sponsor, user, the V&V Agent, and developer to determine what the federation must do to meet the requirements of credibility and acceptability. As mentioned earlier, one of the first actions of Accreditation is to develop the acceptability criteria that the federation must pass to be declared fit for use in the intended application. Quite often the measures of performance and effectiveness MOPs and MOEs are borrowed from the real systems being modeled to serve as a large part of the acceptability criteria, but there are other concerns as well that must be included.  In short, all the factors that make the federation suitable and appropriate are candidates for inclusion.  This is not an easy job, yet it is the backbone and driving force throughout the reuse, development, or integration of the federation.  The V&V Agent tracks these criteria throughout the program execution to ensure that sufficient evidence is collected, retained, and analyzed for transfer to the Accreditation team to support its decision.  Thus, the V&V Agent steers its effort toward Accreditation objectives, but not just those goals alone.  To do so would focus the V&V effort only on those criteria and would miss a myriad of other things that the V&V Agent does throughout the program to improve the overall quality and user satisfaction of the federation. Thus, it is the V&V Agent who remains vigilant over the length of the program to ensure that the federation products are acceptable and credible.  It is the V&V Agent that performs the assessments and retains the data to ensure it is available at the end of the program and that makes recommendations to the Accreditation Agent on the ability of the federation to meet its objectives. It is recommended that the Accreditation Agent generate a written Accreditation Plan. This plan is typically a short document that defines the Accreditation team, its objectives, interfaces with other groups such as the V&V Agent and any external test and evaluation organizations, all the stakeholders, expectation of the Accreditation activity, meetings to attend, the listing of acceptability criteria for the federation, etc.  1.23  Planning the V&V EffortSince the V&V Agent’s responsibility is to ensure credibility of the federation in support of system accreditation, the V&V Plan emanates from the Accreditation Plan.  It should be based on the acceptabilityance criteria identified by the Accreditation team and , the V&V Plan must be written to address assessment of the correctness, completeness, and adequacy of the functional, behavioral, operational, and fidelity characteristics and capabilities of the new federation for the intended application.  The V&V Planners Agent must pick the most appropriate and cost-effective methods, tools, and techniques for each objective and convert these into a series of tasks and processes for execution.V&V Planning should not become a contest to provide the absolute lowest cost effort nor, at the other extreme, to provide the absolute highest possible level of assurance using more elaborate procedures and assessments than are required.  Cost-effective V&V seeks the best-value balance between program needs and real-world constraints.  When faced with budgets that appear too low to accomplish the V&V activities suggested by accreditationprogram requirements for federation credibility, trade-offs have to be made.  These trade-offs should place highest priority on prioritize those tasks that have the greatest return on investment (ROI) and that instill and confirm the greatest degree of confidence in the federates that are being considered for inclusion in the federation and its components.   Thus, final selectionSelection of V&V tasks must be driven byconsider program particulars: discrete requirements, defined needs, known problem areas, high-risk and critical items, , and availability of particular federates and  and appropriate tools, available resources, and key staff.  VV&A The VV&A practitioners must accordingly tailor (and leverage) each step in the 77-Step VV&A process accordingly to provide the most comprehensive program for the lowest cost.    Thus, the V&V Plan is a collection and coalescence integration of all the factors discussed abovethese factors into a document that addresses the phase-dependent as well as  the phase-independent activities that are required to carry out the objectives and contractual requirements of the V&V programproject in support of the Accreditation Plan and Accreditation Decision.  The quality, appropriateness, and comprehensiveness of the plan areis the most significant determinants inhas a great effect on the execution of the V&V effort and, ultimately, determiningon the credibility of the federation.  It is recommended that the V&V Plan be kept separate from (although closely related to)  the Accreditation Plan since different people are responsible for eachthey play separate roles in the FEDEP VV&A process.  Before the V&V Planning can be considered complete, the the V&V Agent planners should perform a thorough review of the V&V Plan based upon system acceptability criteria for required by the Accreditation Decision.  This will ensure that the original assumptions have not changed and that the Plan accounts for and that any requirement changes that have occurred during the FEDEP through the completion of the federationsystem's conceptual modelConceptual Model first two FEDEP steps have been accommodated and accounted for.  It must be emphasized that it is these this set of requirements, measuresMOEs/MOPs, and performance factors that areis used to determine system conformance to the become the acceptability criteria for on which Accreditation is based.  Therefore, they the metrics in this set must be achievable, complete, and sufficient to establish the credibility of the federation beyond any reasonable doubt.  While the Accreditation Plan provides a direction and focus for V&V Agent efforts, it should be augmented by FEDEP products, user input and user evaluations for additional guidance.  If it were not, the V&V effort would focus only on the acceptability criteria and would prevent the V&V Agent from performing quality control/quality assurance functions throughout the FEDEP to improve the overall quality of and user satisfaction with the federation. Thus, the V&V Agent should remain vigilant throughout the entire duration of the program to ensure that federation products are useful and satisfactory to the user as well as complete and credible.  The V&V Agent performs these assessments and ensures that resulting data are available to support its recommendations to the Accreditation Agent on the ability of the federation to meet its objectives.To execute the VV&A Plans efficiently and effectively, the V&V Agent must review, assess, and report to the sponsor on the entire federation modification or development process.  These V&V reviews and assessments must even examine all of the early assumptions concerning how the federation will be used and determine whether proposed changes or new development will be truly adequate for the intended application.  Thus, a good deal of interaction can be expected among the sponsor, user, and developer, the Accreditation Agent, and the V&V Agent.2.  The Seven7-Step Discussion of the VV&A Process A ProcessUsing the FEDEP as its foundation, Tthe 7Seven7-Step VV&A Process is depicted in Figure  1 as an overlay upon the FE1DEP. This discussion provides an end-to-end discussion analysis of the key features and functions of the VV&Athis process as it naturally relates to the FEDEP and does so in a manner and is intended to promote its easy use and understanding and use.   The discussion focuses on of each FEDEP step, and includes a set of typical VV&A tasks and related products that generally correspond to the development development activities and products and activities that occurthatwhich comprise during execution of thate FEDEPstep that require VV&A.  While there may be some repetition of the earlier discussion of V&V and Accreditation planning activities during the following detailed description of the 7-Step VV&A process, the focus shifts to the step-by-step, detailed process description of these activities rather than on giving the development team an overall idea of the VV&A planning which must underpin their development efforts. There is alsoFor a greater understanding of the process,  a more detailed description of this VV&A process model thatthatwhich goes beyond the page limits of this paper that is available upon request from the authors upon request.  It is arranged so that the practitioners can copy one module at a time and have a complete list of all the related tasks, outputs, and other information needed to efficiently plan and execute the  specified VV&A tasks.  FEDEP VV&A Process Step 1:  Objectives VerificationIn the first step of the FEDEP (Define Federation Objectives), the proposed federation is brought to the development of its’s Objectives Statement from identification of the operational deficiency and establishment of its development program.  Key program documents developed during this step include the Needs Statement and the Objectives Statement.This earlyThe FEDEP’s's concurrent initial VV&A step assumes the federation is either still being planned or is in the early stagesin the initial stages of planning, with development anticipated or just begun.   of development. It is here at this point that the Accreditation Authority is appointed and the Accreditation Agent is assembled, so that they mayd to assist in generatinge the acceptability criteria for the federation. The V&V Agent should be brought on as soon as possible after this point. If delayed until later phases, the V&V Agent will have to play “catch up” and cannot have as much impact on overall federation quality as it will if the V&V effort is begun when or near the timeat or near FEDEP inception the federation development is started.  The V&V effort begins with the development of a formal V&V Plan. This Ppe V&V plan should identify 1) the activities that the V&V Agent intendsplans to perform, 2)  the tools that will be used, 3) the expected results or products from each step, 4) the development activities that will be leveraged for V&V use (shared between developer and V&V agent), and 5) additionalthe activities that appear to be goodmust be performed to achieve an acceptable level of federation V&V.

The federation development proposal and plans should be studied in detail. Initial V&V effort focuses on reviewing the Needs Statement and the Objectives Statement.  The Objectives Statement defines the source (originating) requirements for the federation. Large federations sometimes call for the generation of a separate requirements specification and/or database to assist in managing the requirements.  These requirements documents are sometimes called Operational Requirements Documents (ORDs), System Specifications, or whatever seems appropriate by the sponsor.  Regardless of name or form, the V&V Agent Initial V&V efforts should focus on reviewing the Needs Statement and the Objectives Statement. The Objectives Statement defines the source requirements for the federation as extracted from the Needs Statement. Large federations sometimes call for the generation of a separate requirements specification or other subordinate documentation to provide requirements traceability from high-level statements of requirements to individual specific requirements such as the performance of individual objects or behavioral aspects of object interactions. These additional documents are generally called Operational Requirements Documents (ORDs), System Specifications, or other similar titles.  In many cases, these requirements are entered into a database that becomes a primary management tool for tracking these requirements and the development response to them. Regardless of their names or formats, the V&V Agent must review these documents. The V&V Agent should begin by verifying the completeness, correctness, consistency, feasibility, and test capabilities of the final set of system requirements (completed during the next FEDEP step), as modified and clarified by any other existing source documentation.  The completed action comprises the formal Objectives Verification activity, which verifies that the stated objectives and performance of the federation are adequately defined by the set of stated federation requirements and agree with the intended mission, use, and overall application of the federation.These verified requirements will then serve as the basis for developing the federation Conceptual Model, federation design, and development implementation, and will form the baseline for system-level testing.  Another significant group of items to be verified during this step includes all programmatic and other factors that are described in the Objectives Statement.  These include the FEDEP plan, development and testing schedules, program milestones, lists of Government-Furnished and Contractor-Furnished Equipment, data acquisition plans, facilities identification, security plans (including plans to identify, assess, and resolve security issues on multiple levels), identification of participants and players in all test events, configuration management planning, identification and implementation of overall testing concepts, and plans for outside agency involvement.VV&A Process Step 2:  Conceptual Model ValidationIn Step 2 of the FEDEP (Perform Conceptual Analysis), the team develops an appropriate representation, or Conceptual Model, of the real world domain that corresponds to the federation play space, and develops the federation scenario.  The Conceptual Model represents the federation’s translation of the Objectives Statement and the Needs Statement; in the FEDEP, it ultimately replaces those two documents as the "build-to" guideline for the development team. The development of the federation Conceptual Model and its specified execution scenario(s) is the process that should require the greatest effort and attention to detail, as it translates ideas and concepts into the concrete objects and behaviors that represent them.

Careful execution of this step, especially as it relates to validation of the resulting products, is perhaps the most important risk mitigation tool available to the development team.  It is valuable to examine more closely the three mostly concurrent activities in this FEDEP step:  1.

Later, these requirements will be elaborated and traced through the conceptual model, design and implementation, and then into testing.  These requirements should agree with the intended mission, use, and overall application of the federation.  The last significant group of items for verification include all the programmatic and other factors that are described in the Objectives Statement that include the federation development plan, schedules, milestones, lists of GFE and CFE, data, facilities, security issues, participants and players, configuration management planning, overall testing concepts, and plans for outside agency involvement.Step 2: Conceptual Model ValidationConceptual ModelConceptual Model’sit Conceptual Modelthatthat as it relates to’sThe user and sponsor, in conjunction with the developer, produce the scenario needed to fully execute the federation.  A formal federation scenario specification can be developed if desired for very large federations, although it is not a required document.  In complex execution plans, there may can be more than one scenario or, more often, several vignettes that divide the overall scenario into stages or segments so that each part of the execution is easier to analyze and assess. The FEDEP calls for generation of a Federation Scenario Specification (FSS). The V&V Agent reviews and assesses verifies the federation scenario  and its subordinate divisions (vignettes)scenario(s) and FSS to ensure they meet conform to and fully represent the Objectives Statement ofthe objectives of the federation application.    There are three mostly concurrent substeps in this step:  develop scenario, develop federation conceptual model, and develop federation requirements.As the scenario is taking form, the the objectives and originating requirements flow fromteam examines the Objectives Statement and supporting system requirements generated during the previous FEDEP phase step to ensure that each is translated into one or more individual, specific requirements that can be addressed by one or more objects, characteristics, or behaviors within the federation. Additionally, the team should consider generating requirements that complement the federation mission and user needs, even though these needs may not have been explicitly stated in any existing development documentation.  into this one and several activities occur concurrently.  Each oOriginating requirements each tends to generate represent several or many “derived” requirements. This effect occurs because originating requirementsoriginating requirements tend to be written at too a very high level, too high a level to support design specifications.  Furthermore, each one may represent the aggregation of many lower-level requirements, resulting in a decomposition thatwhich and may even affect multiple levels of disaggregation and fan out into more than one functional area in the software and hardware.  This expansion is completed by the process of "requirements allocation," which is the assignment of  or elaboration occurs as the conceptual model is being generated. When thesethe resultant derived requirements are being assigned to their appropriate places in the evolving federation architecture to, provideing a complete picture of the federation’s's required architecture and components.  This must occur before or during conceptual modelConceptual Model development, to enable identification of design requirements and their backward traceability to the applicable originating requirement. , the process is referred to as “requirements allocation.”  The V&V Agent should verify that these derived requirements are correctly defined, decomposed,  traceable back to the originating requirements, and are allocated to their respective parts of the system architecture and its Conceptual Model, and traceable to their originating requirements in development documentation.  Another major concurrent activity takes place as the developer looks to authoritative sources for system performance and behavioral data, mission and operational profiles, and other information to support generation of the Conceptual Model. This information has to support the generation of the derived requirements.  A primary function of the V&V Agent is to verify the correctness and fidelity aspects of these derived requirements in satisfying the user needs as specified in the origination objectives and requirementsNeeds and Objectives Statements of the federation.  .  It is also important, also, that the V&V Agent refer back to the Acceptability Criteria duringin its verification and validation of the federation requirements.   These requirements, translated into the Conceptual Model, become the guidance for subsequent federation development. Thus, it is imperative that they are verified as accurately capturing the originating requirements, and validated as properly representing the needs of the user in initiating the federation development.3.	  The finalMeanwhile, the third concurrent development activity is generating federation requirements that complement the federation mission and user needs.   major concurrent activity during this FEDEP step is the generation of the federation Conceptual Model.   Using the set of derived system requirements as a baseline, the developer looks to authoritative sources for system performance and behavioral data, mission and operational profiles, and other information, and uses them to generate the Conceptual Model.  These simulation requirements pertain to capabilities the federation architecture and design must have to support the role and mission of the federation.  Thus, Tthise Conceptual mModel is a descriptive combination of functions, algorithms, behaviors, descriptions of the participating entities needed to carry out the federation requirements, their functions, internal (algorithmic) transformations, behaviors, and interactions, and the federation architecture and backbone.  .  Since federations are oftencommonly built using an object-oriented methodology, the modelscenario helps to specify the required federation objects, their characteristics and behaviors, object classes, behaviors of each class, identifies the relationships between object classes, , and all object use cases, and the behaviors of each class.  There is no hard rule that developers have to use object oriented methods; they may use and can used traditional structured/procedural approaches as long as they define their data exchange requirements in terms of object attributes and interactions. Verification of the Conceptual Model requires the V&V Agent to ensure that it reflects the complete set of originating and derived requirements, regardless of the developer's’s ability to achieve them.  It becomes the complete statement of the sponsor's’s ideal federation, the design thatwhich fully satisfies the user requirements that which initiated system development.  It describes all of the capabilities thatwhich must be incorporated into the federation architecture and design to support the role and mission of the federation as identified in the federation’s Needs and Objectives Statements.   In validating the Conceptual Model, tThe V&V  Agent validates the Conceptual Model and/or collects evidence of this type of assessment performed by the developer, by ensuring that the characteristics, behaviors, and performance requirements of the simulation objects meet or fall within acceptable limits of those of the real systems and entities that they represent.  The end result is a verified and validated Conceptual Model in which the V&V Agent collects, reviews, and archives all the necessary evidence to confirm to the Accreditation Agent, sponsor, and developer that the Conceptual Model properly serves as the design statement of user and sponsor requirements, and can completely and satisfactorily replace all earlier documentation as the program development baseline.  includes all the user and sponsor requirements and meets the other criteria for validation.  During the development, verification, and and validation of the federation requirements and their translation into the federation Conceptual Model, the Accreditation Agent and Authorityteam is are responsible for finalizing the acceptability criteria for thatwhich must be satisfied for the federation to receive complete and unrestricted Accreditation.  These, the federation acceptability criteria, are usually built around a selected set of the most critical federation originating requirements.  The Accreditation Agent may further develop these criteria by identifying additional metrics thatwhich must be satisfied before the federation can be considered acceptable for its intended application.  These criteria usually a subset of the key federation requirements plus other measures that the Accreditation Authority deems necessary to specify that must be met before the federation can be considered acceptable for the intended application.  The Accreditation Agent can solicit help in this process from any or all of the following—the V&V Agent (primary), user, sponsor, proponent, and developer.  The V&V Agent should review these criteria for correctness and adequacy, as.  T theyhese criteria will become serve as the essential baselinemeasures against which the system, as developed, must be evaluated during that the V&V effortprocess must addressed throughout the rest of the development effort to ensure full and unrestricted final accreditationaccreditation can be achieved if warranted. VV&A Process Step 3:  Design VerificationIn FEDEP Step 3 (Design Federation), the design team uses the specified scenario(s) and Conceptual Model to develop and evolve the federation’s's design framework.  Because of the need to maintain requirements traceability, the set of derived requirements is also a key product used in this step.  The primary purpose of federation designthis step is to establish membership in the federation and to evolve the design framework and the approach for implementing the federation. The federation requirements, scenario (FSS), and Conceptual Model are the key inputs from the previous phases that support this effort.  As in the previous FEDEP step, this step encompasses three principal activities:The first FEDEP activity in this step is to select the federates to be included in the simulation federation.  Based on the assumption that it is more cost-effective to reuse existing components, the development team begins to structure the simulation design by  by exaexaminingmining the suitability of individual existing simulations to become members of the federation.  The selection process is driven by the perceived ability of potential federation members to adequately represent the objects, behavioractivities, and interactions found in the Conceptual Model.  Several otherOther factors can alsothatwhich influence selection include n—user or sponsor recommendations, pre-existing biases and preferences of the developer, availability, cost, VV&A history, and many other factorsso forth.  The developer team searcheses available electronic libraries and other sources for available Simulation Object Models (SOMs) that appear to meet the needs of the federation.  Reusing Examination of existing FOMs also helps the team identify additional brings forth potential federates.  Once the development teamer tentatively selects the federatselects the federates, es, their SOMs are carefully reviewed to assist in the final selection process.  The developer team also assesses the detailed design documentation and any documented risks associated with their use. The V&V Agent participates in this step by reviewingalso reviews the key technical issues and risks associated withcharacteristics of each federate.  These include the federate’s requirements for, and participation in, e in terms of ttime and federation management, runtime performance, potential compatibility with other selected federates, implementation requirements, fidelity, and , prior VV&A history,, among others.   This review is conducted to determine the extent to which each federate fits into the evolving federation design—both in terms of extending the federation's’s capability to support its set of derived requirements, and in terms of the compatibility of each federate with the federation architecture and previously-selected federates.  The V&V Agent verifies that these federates meet the requirements of the federation, and initially validates that their objects are appropriate for use in the federation being developed.implementation approaches, etc.  The second major development step is to prepare the federation design, which begins once all federates have been identified.  This involves evaluating the set of existing components to be reused against the Conceptual Model to ensure that the federation design addresses, to the extent possible, all requirements that have been established for it.  During this activity, the responsibility to represent the entities, behaviors, and interactions in the Conceptual Model are assigned to specific federates.  Using the specified scenario(s), Conceptual Model, and the set of derived requirements developed in previous FEDEP steps, the development team must determine whether  The responsibilities are allocated to represent the entities and actions in the Conceptual Model to specific federates. By using the scenario, Conceptual Model, and federation requirements prepared in the previous FEDEP steps as inputs, this activity determines if the set of selected federates provides the full set of required functionality, or if one or more will require modifications, and whether one or more new federates must be developed.  As agreements on assigned responsibilities are negotiated, various design trade-off investigations are conducted.  These investigations can be considered to beare part of early execution planning and may addressconsider a wide range of technical issues.  Federation design strategies, including modeling approaches and tool selection, may be reassessed and renegotiated based on the results of these investigations.detailed information about the federates.  When the federation renegotiation represents a modification or extension to aan existing  component to be reused in the previous federation, new federates have to be made fully aware of the negotiated agreementsnegotiation results within the earlier federation and must be and given the opportunity to revisit pertinent technical issues.        The V&V Agent verifiesensures that all requirements from the previous phase are properly allocated among federates and are validly represented in their design and that of the overall federation of the federates.  The V&V Agent also verifies, and  that the agreements and trades compromises reached and are reasonable and correct according to the accreditation criteria, and are properly recorded and represented in the federation design.  (This may involve documenting design decisions thatwhich require deviation from the federation Conceptual Model.)  The principal VV&A process output from this FEDEP step is the verified federation design, which serves as the blueprint for federation development in FEDEP Step 4 and beyond.d are reasonable and correct.      In the case of federations thatwhich will require some level of security classification,  For secure federations, considerations for maintaining a securethe appropriate security posture should be made at this time.  Development of a federation security plan should be mature enough to allow for the designation of aA security point of contact for the overall federation and and federate security representatives should be designatedfor its federates. The V&V Agent must comply ensure that federation compliance with all security requirements for the federationwill not impact its VV&A posture.  The third major development step is to complete a coordinated plan that will guide the development, testing, and execution of the federation.  This requires very close collaboration among all the federation participants to ensure a common understanding of federation goals and requirements, and to identify and agree to appropriate standards to be incorporated and, based on software engineering best practices, development methods and procedures based on software engineering best practicesto be used.  Object-oriented (OO) techniques are fast becoming the preferred federation design approach, since many of the available FEDEP tools are also OO.  The early plans and Objectives Statement prepared in FEDEP Phase Step 1 are used as the basis for the more detailed plan developed here.  The plan should include specific tasks and milestones for each federate, along with proposed dates for completion of each task. The plan should also identify the tools that the developer anticipates using throughout the remaining phases of the FEDEP. This list should include, including tools for RTI construction, federation runtime tools, development CASE tools, configuration management and software library tools, testing and analysis tools, support tools for measuring and monitoring network performance, collecting and reducing data, and so forth.etc.       It is important that the V&V Agent be intimately involved in the development of this plan.  Development standards and supporting tools should be verified as appropriate for their development purpose, and the V&V Agent should ensure that their products can be both verified and validated during the development process.   The V&V tools shoulds will also be selected after based on development toolthe developer’s selection is made to ensure an appropriate mix of development and complementary V&V tools.  Federations with some amothatwhich incorporate the use ofunt of stochastic factors need to consider how to design tests with controlled variability and to estimate how many tests will be required to produce statistically valid results.  These detailed plans and agreements need to be archived for use and reference later in the development program and to assist in possible reuse of the federation in the future.  They also need to be included in the federation’s's V&V Plan.  The V&V Agent reviews and assesses the plans and agreements, and continues to monitor those retains the ones appropriate to accreditation.   In summary, this phase defines a highly collaborative approach to federation design, which brings all the participants to a common level of understanding and agreement on federation goals and and requirements, and the approach and standards used by the federation to meet them.  Reaching consensus among all the participants can be especially challenging when existing federations are being modified, which is likely to negate previous agreements that existed for the previous federatioany componentsn being reused.  Agreements must be reached concerning selection of common development methods and tools, configuration management, input and output data and all data interfaces, testing strategies, and security.  All of these factors and issues are reviewed by the V&V Agent for correctness, adequacy, impact, and risk to the federation and to the V&V effort.VV&A Process Step 4: Implementation VerificationIn the related FEDEP Step 4, Develop Federation, the development team finalizes the FOM, develops the federates (modifying those that are reused), and prepares the entire federation for integration and testing.  Perhaps the most extensive step of the FEDEP, this step leverages all previous development products and significantly benefits from the careful and comprehensive planning that went into their development.For VV&A purposes, development activities in this FEDEP step can be segmented into three principal tasks:Develop the FOM.  As the development team constructs the FOM, they may choose to reuse either a single FOM or integrate selected parts of multiple FOMs to satisfy federation requirements.  These FOMs may have been previously identified during the FEDEP design step, or they may be initially considered and selected during this step.  The teamy may also decide to construct a new FOM, either in total or in part.  Once developed, the FOM may require modification of existing components to resolve inconsistencies or development of additional components to provide functionality not supported by existing resources.      The V&V Agent should review all development decisions and the evolving FOM to ensure essential items are not forgotten or misinterpreted, that individual components are consistently and completely integrated into the FOM, and that the FOM addresses the full set of requirements and functionality represented in the Conceptual Model.  Ultimately, this review must result in the  verification of the FOM as accurately rendering all relevant requirements, or includewith clear documentation of the justification for, and resolution of, the FOM’s failure to satisfy one or more requirement.  Such documentation should include an initial risk assessment for use in programmatic decisions and eventual input to the Accreditation Decision. Implement the federate designs.  Based on the Conceptual Model, the results of the requirements allocation process, and any negotiated federation agreements, the design team establishes the final design parameters for each individual federate and for the federation as a whole.      The set of negotiated agreements to be incorporated into federate designs must also include those negotiations thatwhich occur outside the FOM, but that impact its development.  Agreements must be reached on the contents and resolution of the common synthetic environment, the fidelity of interacting federate models, identification of consistent or federate-wide algorithms for line of sight, sensor field of view, and other derived object characteristics and performance, and so forth.  Other typical agreements pertain to execution initialization, synchronization, save and restore functions, and termination. The V&V Agent should confirm the traceability and accuracy of the requirements that drive these factors and then assess  their proposed design implementations.      The V&V Agent must also monitor the development of the individual designs, and work with the design team to ensure completeness of each design and consistency of all designs across the federation.  Because of potential differences between federates in terms of accuracy and fidelity requirements, this is one of the greatest challenges facingfaced by the VV&A team.  The team needs to be able to monitor the exchange of data across the federation, to ensure consistent data availability to, and implementation within, all federates.  The team needs to track data quality as the data move through individual federate transformations to ensure that its original quality is not unnecessarily reduced.  More importantly, the team needs to ensure that lower-quality data is not assumed to be of greater quality and used to justify greater accuracy or fidelity than it can reasonably support without aliasing error into federate calculations.  It is reasonable for the V&V Agent to leverage, whenever possible, any relevant data and activity analysis performed by the developer.Implement the federation infrastructure.  Based on the final designs for both federates and federation, the development team must establish the necessary infrastructure to support federation integration and testing.  Included in this infrastructure is the set of all hardware, run-time infrastructure firmware and software, and any testing resource needed to support operational and V&V testing.      As the federation infrastructure is implemented, the development team must identify the federation’s's authoritative and approved data sources to be used.  Data stores from these sources are used to convert the functional description of the specified scenario to an executable scenario instance, supporting federation testing conducted directly within the context of interest.  Later in the FEDEP, they will drive the execution of the federation.  The V&V Agent should validate direct data element traceability from stated data requirements through their translation into SOMs and the FOM to their production data element equivalents.This purpose of this step is to develop the FOM, modify the federates when necessary, and prepare the federation for integration and testing. There are several different approaches to FOM development that require definition: [1]Constructing the FOM from the bottom up using the OMDD, the federation scenario, Conceptual Model and possibly the ideal FOM, if provided in Step 2.Merging SOMs of all the participating federates, while removing aspects of those SOMs that do not apply.Beginning with a SOM that closely aligns with the desired FOM, removing aspects that do not apply, and merging in elements from other SOMs until all functions and systems are represented.Beginning with a FOM from previous, but similar application, and modifying and adding to it until complete.Beginning with a FOM that provides a common frame of reference to a given user community, removing and adding elements until the FOM is complete.  All of these approaches will require some tailoring of the basic HLA Object Model (OM) development process. The following is a brief summary of the FOM development process:Determine federate publishing and subscription capabilitiesSpecify federate publication agreementsDetermine attribute and parameter requirementsPrepare class structure tablesPrepare attribute and parameter tablesPrepare routine space tablePrepare object model identification table, etc.There are a significant number of tools that can assist in the FOM development.  Libraries and repositories are again searched for object models that aid in generating the framework or acquiring piece parts or components for the new FOM. The V&V Agent should review the development decisions and the evolving FOM to ensure essential items are not forgotten or misinterpreted, and that the FOM includes the full set of requirements and functionality represented in the Conceptual Model. The FOM defines and documents the full set of data required among the federates, which the V&V Agent verifies for correctness and completeness, leveraging from the data analysis performed by the developer where possible.  Once the authoritative and approved data sources that will be used are identified, the actual data stores are used to convert the functional description of the scenario to an executable scenario instance.  This supports federation testing to be conducted directly within the context of interest and drives the execution of the federation later in the FEDEP.  BBecause the last two activities in this FEDEP step are performed concurrently, it is very likely that the entire step is performed iteratively.  As agreements are made and implemented,  There are some types of negotiations that are not included in the FOM, but that impact its development.  For example, the Conceptual Model is used to depict the baseline behaviors of all federation objects and how they interact.  However, other agreements have to be reached on the common synthetic environment, terrain database and its resolution, fidelity of interacting federate models, algorithms for line of sight, sensor field of view, etc. There are also issues that pertain to initialization, synchronization, save and restore functions, and termination of the execution. The V&V Agent should confirm the traceability and accuracy of the requirements that drive these factors and then assess their proposed design implementations.  The final two activities in this step are concurrent and implement the federation design and infrastructure.  The Federate modifications needed to 1) correctly represent their assigned objects, functions, and behaviors as described in the Conceptual Model, 2) produce and exchange federation data with other federates as defined in the FOM, and abide with established federation agreements.  This may require iiiInternal l modifications to the federate or may require modifications or extensions to the individual federate’s HLA interface interface must be made.  Often, these to support new FOM data structures or HLA services that were not supported in the past.  In cases ofWhen non-HLA compliant federates are to be used, it may be necessary to develop an HLA interface for the federate.  In this case, the federate developer must weigh short-term expediency against longer-term reusability when designing and implementing a compliant interface. The V&V Agent reviews and assesses the proposed modifications for reasonableness, correctness, completeness, and ability to accomplish them in the proposed program risk (both resources and timetable) in implementing themtime frame.  Once this FEDEP step is complete, the fFederation infrastructure is implemented and the RTI initialization data areis established and modified as required to maxoptimize run-time impact performance.    VV&A Process Step 5: Federation Validation ThFEDEP Step 5 consists of three development activitiesis activity consists of three parts performed by the developer: 1) execution planning, which defines the information and information flow required to execute the federation, 2) federation integration, and 3) federation testing, which pertains toincludes three levels of testing—federate, integration, and federation—that first seekto ensure compatibility among the interacting federation elements.  This multi-level testing encompasses  and end up performing verification testing first followed byand subsequent validation testing of the entire federation.  In this FEDEP Step, the following development activities are included:1.	Execution planning.  In planning the federation execution, effort is focused on completely identifying the activity and information flow whichthat will occur during federation execution.  Similar to developing a programming flowchart and related data flow diagram for the federation, the development team must explicitly outline the execution timeline of each process and identify the availability and transference of each individual data element involved in execution of the federation and each of its federates.  The main activities in execution planning are to plan the necessary integration and verification tests followed by comprehensive validation tests ensuring adequate test coverage.        DuringThis includes descriptions execution planning, the development team must identify of the performance requirements of the federation and capabilities of the HLA Runtime Infrastructure (RTI) thatwhich satisfy them.  To accomplish this, they must examine . To accomplish this, the planning must include performance requirements for each federate, all synthetic environment, host computers, s, and nthe communications network, and the simulation operating environment, and extracting relevant execution data throughout the process.  When combinedconsolidated, the collected data should includeinformation includes all the execution-specific information parameters needed by the federation developer to test and operateoperate and test the federation.  These data, together with together with the implementation-specific RTI Initialization Data (RID) file,  associated with the specific implementation of the RTI and the completed FOM and its associated Federation Execution Data file, must contain provide all the information necessary to begin the integration and testing activiintegrate the infrastructure and test its ability to support federation executionty.  They will also form the basis for user and maintenance documentation.  With the assistance of the VV&A team, the development team must also craft the necessary integration, verification, and comprehensive validation tests to ensure that the infrastructure properly supports federation operation.       The V&V Agent reviews and assesses these integration test plans for completeness and appropriateness.  From this assessment, the V&V Agent identifies essential areas for verification testing.  Verification test objectives can usually be folded into the developer’sdevelopment testing with no impact, since the developer must test the integrated infrastructure as part of system acceptance testing.  This is an outstanding example of the extensive leveragingTest results are shared and represent a high degree of leveraging utilized by the V&V Agent to optimizefor the V&V effort. since the developer does the lion’s share of the testing.  The V&V Agent participates in the testing as agreed to by the sponsor and developer.  Cooperation in testing is beneficial to both parties.  The V&V Agent may also verify the hardware installation and its operation, network interface, and input data before it is used.  Any visualization and data collection support systems that are included should also be verified to ensure they are working correctly. Frequently, integration begins by bringing one federate at a time into the federation to ensure it is compatible with the synthetic environment, network, and RTI services.  Federate compliance testing can be performed at any time it is expedient to do so.  2.	Using the plans just developed, the development team integrates the federation as it is intended to be  executed.  Frequently, integration begins by bringing one federate at a time into the federation to ensure it is compatible with the execution environment, network, and RTI services.  Since many development paradigms are based on the "test-fix" approach, this activity may involve close coordination with the V&V Agent.  Initial testing may focus on verifying the hardware installation and its operation, network interfaces, and input data as they are integrated, but before they are used.  Additionally, the V&V Agent may verify the correct operation of any visualization and data collection support systems to be integrated.  Compliance and other testing can be performed when expedient during the integration process.Once the 3.	      3.    Once all federates are allhave been integrated, theis FEDEP step then addresses federation enters the three-level3-part  testing. approach b  The first level focuses on the federates themselves, ensuring that each individual federate correctly implements FOM requirements and properly operates within the execution environment and in accordance with established federation agreements.  eginning with federate testing that ensures each federate correctly implements the federation requirements document in the FOM, environment description, and any operating agreements.  TThe second level tests the integration of each federate into the federation infrastructure, ensuring that it correctly designated integration testing executes the federation as an integrated whole observing the ability of the federates to interact correctlyinteracts with the RTI and exchanges data as described in the FOM.  This testing sometimes results in a series of test-fix-test sequences until correct operation is achieved.  The final levelactivity , federation testing, testsvalidates the ability of the entire federation to interoperate to the degree necessary to achieve federation objectives.  This includes observing that all federates interact according to the defined specified scenario(s) and at the level of fidelity required for the application.  BeThe data collection plans are executed and the HLA Management Object Model (MOM) can be used to provide useful information. cause these development tests also provide key information for the Accreditation Decision, it is reasonable for the V&V team to be significantly involved in this activity.  The degree to which the V&V Agent participates in the testing is determined by the sponsor and developer, recognizingas that cooperation in testing is especially beneficial to the development team.  This can result in one of three typical levels of involvement:  (1) V&V team participating “hands-on,” directly alongside the developer’s test team, in performing the tests, (2) V&V team monitoring the execution of key tests, or (3) V&V team only receiving test data from the more significant tests.  The V&V Agent can interface in several ways with the developer during this period.  The V&V staff can participate “hands-on” in the testing along side the developer’s test team, monitor the execution of key tests, or agree to receive test data only from the more significant tests. The first two options levels of involvement tend to be much more supportive ofbeneficial to the developer , as they provide the developer with significant testing and technical expertise and provide the V&V Agent with additional opportunities to buildand build good rapport with the sponsor and developer.        IValidation testingt should be noted that early validation may uncover minor problems thatwhich can be fixed inside the test structure, or may identify more serious issues whichthat need immediate correction lest they contaminate subsequent test results.  Resolution of these issues may need to be negotiated with developers of the individual federates or with the overall federation developer.  Any issue whichthat may result in a cost or schedule impact may uncover problems associated with interoperability between federates, system network loading, performance issues associated with the RTI, and other items requiring correction before the testing can continue.  should Sometimes these involve the federate owners and other times the federation developer.  More serious problems need to be discussed with the sponsor developer and V&V Agentand sponsor before making corrective action decisionsdeciding on appropriate corrective actions.  Once the federation is sufficiently validated (proves, through testing, that it meets statedpasses it requirements through testing) and appears stable and ready for accreditation, a final, full-upcomprehensive test run is recommended.  If this run is normal successful, withand alll the support functions operational (fully-functional LANs and  and WANs, proper are operating, data collection and logging,  and collection are functioning, etc.synchronized timing, and so forth) are operational, the team may decide to designate this run for submission to the Accreditation team.  However, the  the run can be designated for accreditation, or some Accreditation Authorityies may request a that a specific test be run in the presence of test be run especially for accreditation with the Accreditation Agent (team) and V&V Agent present.  Outside oIn this case, observers and analysts from outside organizations such as test agencies may also also be invited to attend.  Often, these observers are augmented by sSubject matter experts (SMEs) are solicited throughout from within potentialthe user organizations and may be asked to join forces with the developer, V&V Agent or Accreditation Agent teams to improve the level ofprovide additional operational expertise in specific disciplines.  Refer to the next Step for more details on Accreditation.  VV&A Process Step 6:  Accreditation DecisionIn the sixth step of the FEDEP, activity is focused on executing the tested federation and documenting all output information.  As in many other activities, leveraging between essentially concurrent development and VV&A processes is possible and highly recommended.In the previous FEDEP step, federation testing activities provided the option of conducting a formal accreditation test run.  If that did not occur, this FEDEP step provides additional opportunities, as the focus of the development process is on ensuring that all aspects of the completed federation satisfy user requirements.  During these tests, actual federation participants execute portions of the federation using the specified scenario(s).  Because of the resources whichthat may be involved in such development tests, leveraging these tests and their results for VV&A use may be the optimum method of conducting necessary tests for accreditation.  This requires that the V&V Agent and supporting personnel pay close attention to all aspects of the test whichthat relate to the federation’s's acceptability criteria.As outlined in Step 5 of the VV&A Process Model, accreditation testing can take several forms all of which produce the same final result.  The most common case involves a run for record of the entire federation using as much of the entire scenario as possible to thoroughly test and evaluate the federation capabilities.  Either this test can be designated as the accreditation run or another test just like it can be run afterward when time and resources permit.  The point here is that large tests that involve many players at remote sites consume significant resources.  Therefore, when all the possible participants are present, do not waste the opportunity.  Use the full-up run for accreditation, which means paying attention to all the details concerning the set-up, initialization, scenarios, input data, environment, data recording, witnesses, etc.  In other words do what is necessary to prove the test passes it acceptability criteria.  Therefore, the developer, sponsor, users, and V&V Agent should all be prepared for the event, with the same rigor as if it was the actual intended use of the federation.  The only thing lacking will likely be the presence of live forces interacting in the scenario.  However, surrogates can often be used to at least partially fill those gaps.  The second activity of this FEDEP step involves review and reduction of all data collected during federation testing.  Once the Accreditation run has occurred, tThe V&V Agent, Accreditation Agent, and all other stakeholders begin the data analysis.  Most tests of this type have at leastprincipally use three levels of data reduction, with related  and appropriate levels of analysisreview to ensure that the set of collected data is complete that accompany them.  The first level is the real-time feedback from observers who hover around stealth viewers, operators'’s computer screens, etc, and other .simulation play indicators and actually record their observations.  By the end of the testactual test run, the outcome results of first-level data review areis pretty wgenerally well known with regard to as concerns the more obvious (mostly visual) the more obvious (observable)  performance and behavioral parts of the operations.  The secondnext level is the “quick-look data” obtained from within the simulation play.  This will include input from a variety of sources and stakeholders.  Using recorded data, the review team quickly examines (on a scale of hours) Here major significant performance parameters are examined quickly (in a few hours) from recorded datafederation performance, without explicit in-depth analysis.  AtBy this point, there is somethe team has a general idea  assurance of how wellthe acceptability of the federation against meets itsthe acceptability criteria, and can use this second-level data review to indicate the development’s's overall success or failure.  This will include inputs from a variety of sources and stakeholders.  The results of this quick look data pretty much spell out the success or failure of the federation.  The third typelevel of data analysis reduction and review is thorough enough to likely to require as much as 30 daysa month to perform and is usually not required for accreditation, but is used in the final FEDEP step to will yieldyield an After Action Report, discussed in more detail in Step 7. Thus, in most cases, the Accreditation recommendation can be made following on the basis examination of the "quick-look (first- and second-level) data" review data if it looks like what was expected.  When the opportunity for or intended use of the federation for an exercise or demonstration is very close on the calendar, the Accreditation Authority Authority is then in possession of enough information to can do whatever seems appropriate. OtherwiseWhen review of the "quick-look data" yields aberrations or questions, he or she may want to wait for additional data reduction and review to occur before making the Accreditation Ddecision.   The V&V Agent will be tasked to examine the primary artifacts produced during development and the evidence collected during each step as well as the test results to ensure they are consistent. When approaching the Accreditation Decision, the V&V Agent may be asked for their evidence and their opinion on the results and evidence to back up that opinion. All concerns and anomalies are noted and included in the V&V Agent’s inputs to the Accreditation Agent.  If the V&V Agent’s recommendation and the Accreditation Agent’s opinion are similar, the total body of evidence is summarized and presented to the Accreditation Authority for consideration.  Otherwise, additional investigation is needed to resolve open issues.On occasionWhen unexpected results appear during data reduction, during post-test analysis  the V&V Agent will find it necessarywill most likely need to delve deeper intoperform additional, more detailed testing the testing than that performed covered as part of the development acceptance testingby the developer’s assessments.  In these cases, the V&V Agent may request additional runs, often with special data recording and reduction requests.  In other cases, the V&V Agent may introduce its own tools and tests to thoroughly wring out a troublesome algorithm, perform detailed timing measurements, assessments, etc.or otherwise decompose a process or object in order to thoroughly investigate problems. While tThis type of testing is highly dependent upon the types of federates and their intended use, the V&V Agent should be prepared to perform such tests—and may recommend they be included in the original set of execution tests.. VV&A Process Step 7:  Post-Execution Follow-up and ArchivalIn the related FEDEP step, the development team performs complete data analysis for reporting to the sponsor and user, and prepares the After-Action Report (AAR).  Other items that the development team should prepare are a report of the lessons learned, and a general summary of the reusability of the federation products (federates, FOMs, SOMs, Conceptual Model, network configuration, viewers, support systems, environment, input data, output data recording and reduction, etc.). Additionally, the post-execution team collectively documents what follow-up actions should be recommended to the sponsor.  In the related VV&A step, the V&V Agent should expect to remain with the development team for nominally a month, participating in post-event analysis but most importantly to complete and document all VV&A activities.  Participation in the in-depth examination of collected data adds an additional level of verificationThe primary point that prevails this step is that the V&V Agent stays on to participate in the wrap up the federation execution and port-event analysis for a reasonable amount of time, nominally 30 days, but longer if required.  The Accreditation Agent may or may not participate depending on the availability of the people.The purpose of this step is to further analyze and evaluate the data acquired during the execution of the federation for its intended use and to report the results back to the sponsor and users.  This more in-depth examination of test results is necessary to ensure th that the federation fully meets the development requirements as stated in the conceptual modelConceptual Modelrequirements established early in the development period.  It also allows the V&V Agent to It also re-examinesreexamine the federation’s's performance against the acceptability criteria generated by the Accreditation Agent to more clearly determine how well they are being met, and to determine if additional work is required to improve marginal or nonconforming performance.  The V&V Agent can expect to be involved in the preparation of at least two documents.  The first is the development team's’s AAR, The first step is for the developer and V&V Agent to comprehensively analyze the test results, and then evaluate and feedback the results to the sponsor and users.  Frequently, the results are the subject of an After Action Report (AAR), which includes a detailed accounting of the progress of the acceptance the test(s) and the ability of the federation to perform each part of thehow well each part of the specified scenario was performed by the federationscenario(s).  The AAR often includes both strengths and weaknesses.  The V&V Agent is a primary reviewer and contributor to this report.  When the Accreditation Agent is available, they too will contribute to the report and will focus strongly principally on the the federation’s's ability to satisfy all acceptability criteria and how well they were satisfiedcriteria. Other items that should be prepared are the lessons learned to which all participants contribute, and a general summary of the reusability of the federation products (federates, FOMs, SOMs, Conceptual Model, network configuration, viewers, support systems, environment, input data, output data recording and reduction, etc.). The post-execution team collectively documents what follow-up actions should be recommended to the sponsor.  Once this is accomplished, the V&V Agent also writes its own final report, which includes a summary of the VV&A activities and accomplishments, including those that had a significant impact on the success of the federation development and test execution.  This VV&A history should represent a sufficient set of information to allow reconstruction of the federation VV&A process and support its reuse, at least in part, for future applications.  accompany the archival of the federation materials and information that represents a sufficient package to reconstruct the federation and reuse it, at least in part, for future applications.  Thus, In this manner, the VV&A history should always accompanyshould become an integral component of the historical files associated with the federation.  3.  ConclusionIn conclusion, theThis new 7-Step VV&A Process Model should prove to be easier to use than the previous onespreviously proposed models since it aligns seamlessly with the FEDEP and provides a comprehensive, yet tailorable process that ensures the credibility, utility, and integrity of the federation to which it is applied.  In addition, the VV&A history formed by the application of VV&A assists greatly in the cost-effective reuse of the federation for future applications.  About the AuthorsAuthor BiographiesAbout the AuthorsVirginia T.
