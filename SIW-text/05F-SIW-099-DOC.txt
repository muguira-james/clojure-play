In an iterative process, the terrain team supporting Joint Forces Command (JFCOM) Joint Experimentation has worked with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) to draft geospatial specifications specific to urban terrain for both experimentation and operational use. These specifications provide numerous benefits: 1) focusing data collection on valued features and attributes reduces cost; 2) the specifications represent an opportunity for simulation community needs to be addressed prior to data collection rather than requiring that synthetic natural environments retrofit previously collected data; 3) they provide a base set of features, attributes, and collection requirements from which profiles may be created for specific collection efforts; and 4) encapsulating requirements in an Environmental Data Model (EDM) enables comparing and coordinating simulation data needs with other collection needs. This paper discusses balancing costs with content fidelity and describes draft area of interest and urban backdrop specifications.1. IntroductionThis year technical staff from JFCOM and NGA have sought to define urban terrain specifications at a level-of-detail suitable for production of prototype data sets. The primary goal is design of a set of general purpose urban terrain specifications that support both experimentation and operational activities. Other goals include increased accuracy and reduced production time. Data collection is costly and labor intensive; getting it right the first time is important. We seek well-defined collection specifications from which mission specific profiles can be defined for individual projects/budgets. Close coordination between modeling and simulation (M&S) users with geospatial data producers holds the potential to avoid unnecessary data collection/cost despite demanding requirements and to minimize the need for M&S generation of synthetic natural environments that reengineer previously collected data. Coordinated creation of specifications represents an opportunity for simulation community needs to be addressed prior to data collection. This paper focuses on a subset of these efforts -- the creation of cost neutral superset JSAF requirements for high-resolution urban areas-of-interest (AOI) and lower resolution urban background areas in the form of Environmental Data Models (EDMs) and correlated collection guidance documents.2. ContextThe inability of widely available, traditional products to serve M&S needs is demonstrated by the feature density comparison of an opeational product such as VMAP1 (see Figure 2.1) and a M&S database (see Figure 2.2, shown at the same scale as the VMAP1). Similar concerns exist for the limited types of features that are captured and the sparse attribution applied to these features in standard products.Historically, M&S teams have extensively edited and intensified standard digital map products to generate simulation specific terrain data bases. That approach is inefficient. Given the potential for creating economies of scale, agencies are embracing new centralized business models for the collection, storage, and processing of data. For example, PEO STRI intends to centralize terrain database production within SE Core. SHAPE  \* MERGEFORMAT Figure 2.1: VMAP1 SHAPE  \* MERGEFORMAT Figure 2.2 Jakarta DatabaseNGA is focusing on Foundation-Based Operations (FBO) and a Unified Profile for Mission Specific Data (MSD). Combining operational and simulation data collection under FBO holds great promise for economic efficiencies and responsiveness. Wrote NGA: ‚ÄúThis [FBO] concept involves populating various databases comprising Foundation data to improve NIMA‚Äôs posture (i.e. readiness) to support future operations. It also involves developing responsiveness‚Äîcapabilities to support specific missions by intensifying existing foundation data [1].‚ÄùIncreasing interoperability among operational activities and simulation is a laudable goal, but remains a significant technical challenge. These two functions can differ in geospecificity of data. Some simulations are conducted on plausible geospatial data without a need for explicit accuracy or correctness. Some simulations synthesize plausible dynamic features that operational use would require in source data. Currency is critical for operational use. Simulation thrives on dense features and rich attributes to create realistic, cluttered environments. Simply appending the requirements of simulation and operational data would balloon collection efforts and costs. Combining the highest requirements of both functions is not the answer.3. ContentOur objective was to develop specifications for JFCOM Joint Urban Operations (JUO) geospatial requirements that included:FeaturesFeature AttributesFeature Attribute DomainsFeature Extraction CriteriaFeature Extraction GuidanceTwo generic specifications were developed: one for a high density urban area of interest (AOI), and the other for a lower resolution urban backdrop required to ‚Äúfill in‚Äù a large urban area in a simulation. These specifications must be sufficiently flexible to accommodate extraction cost trades among feature density requirements, feature extraction difficulty, size of the urban area of interest (AOI), and urban background requirements outside the primary AOI. To achieve this flexibility, the terrain team adjudicated a data model union of operational requirements, modeling and simulation requirements, and source products, shown in Table 3.1.Table 3.1: Environmental Data Model DescriptionsShort NameDescriptionInitial UnionUnion of the following EDMs: VMAP1, UVMAP, TLM, regional and small area data sets, FFD (2000), urban data set produced for the 2004 Athens Olympics (features only) (Athens), WARSIM Terrain Common Data Model (TCDM), OneSAF Objective System EDM for Terrain (OOS-Terrain), and ancillary features of known or potential importance to JFCOM (e.g., alley).

Process4.1 OverviewFirst, we determined the union of features, attributes, and allowable values. For simulation EDMs, these only included information required of source products. Second, we adjudicated the union set of over 500 features, over 3,000 attributes and over 13,000 allowable values. For the generic urban area of interest specification, the process resulted in 161 features, 657 attributes and 1,091 allowable values.Collection criteria were associated with each feature, and a guidance document was drafted following the format of existing NGA collection guidance documents. This process required JSAF terrain expertise, NGA expertise, data model expertise, and CDMF tools and is depicted in Figure 4.1. SHAPE  \* MERGEFORMAT Figure 4.1: Notional Adjudication Process4.2 Content AdjudicationAn Environmental Data Model (EDM) is a logical data model specifying features, attributes, attribute value ranges, and relationships for an environmental domain (e.g., terrain, atmosphere, ocean, space) [2]. Formal EDMs have been developed for current and emerging modeling and simulation systems, data products from authoritative data providers, and systems in the Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) domain. The Common Data Model Framework (CDMF) is a collection of tools that help automate the generation, maintenance and analysis of EDMs. For example, the CDMF automates answering the question, ‚ÄúWhat percentage of the environmental terrain data required by Objective OneSAF is actually provided by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) product Urban Vector Map?‚Äù Other analyses allow investigation of environmental data interoperability between specific M&S and/or C4ISR systems.The CDMF provides a common framework from which EDMs are initialized, defined, analyzed, reviewed, compared, integrated, maintained and exported. The framework operates from a common database schema and a set of utilities including Microsoft Access¬Æ databases, forms, reports, code, and Visual Basic¬Æ (VB) applications that allow consistent EDM operations for EDMs compliant with the schema defined for the CDMF. It provides for dictionary agility and includes several dictionaries for EDM construction. The capability of dealing with multiple data dictionaries is especially important for combining NGA source products (Feature and Attribute Coding Catalogue, FACC, data dictionary) and simulation data models (often in Environmental Data Coding Specification, EDCS).Figure 4.2: CDMF CapabilitiesThe CDMF provides an abstracted paradigm for data modeling. Rather than entering and interacting with features, attributes and relationships exclusively via Entity‚ÄìRelationship (ER) or UML diagrams from proprietary toolsets, the data are operated on and then stored in an open relational database using data entry forms for interacting with features, attributes, attribute values and relationships. It is this underlying common format using relational database capabilities that permits the rapid development of queries and automated analysis of multiple EDMs. Entity-Relationship and/or UML diagrams remain available via a CDMF export procedure.The CDMF embodies a structural specification for EDM development as shown in Figure 4.2 and a set of core functionalities to assist in the construction and analysis of CDMF compliant Environmental Data Models (EDMs):ability to generate an EDM template for new EDMs;agility allowing an EDM to be created using any one of the available data dictionaries;forms for manipulation of features, attributes, attribute domains and feature relationships;ability to generate delta-reports between CDMF compliant EDMs;standard report-based EDM comparison rubrics;ability to check compliance of a subject EDM to the CDMF;ability to maintain EDM content with configuration management and change histories;automated generation of an EDM representation for import/export of ER diagrams;automated export of an EDM to XML providing for import into UML toolkits;ability to export an EDM to a physical database representation in XML for ESRI Geodatabases;mapping utilities to aid in mapping environmental content from one EDM to another; andautomated conversion capabilities allowing for CDMF compliant upgrades including updates of the underlying database schema or content.The CDMF proved invaluable in the development of these specifications. It was used for comparisons of multiple EDMs, generation of EDM reports, ensuring consistency in the resulting specifications, and capturing rationale on a per-data-element basis.The ultimate consumers for these geospatial data include the various federates of the JSAF Federation, which includes the JSAF real-time constructive simulation, a second simulation that represents large numbers of dynamic civilian entities (vehicles and pedestrians), a visual 3-D simulation, electronic map displays, and a simulation of existing and novel sensor systems. While each of these simulations continues to evolve with improving performance in complex urban areas, our principle criterion for selection of a particular feature or attribute became whether these simulations either currently utilize that datum or are expected to do so within the next 12 months.For example, the dense representation of buildings is important for its effect on line-of-sight and entity movement. A complete road network is required for the simulated movement of potentially hundreds of thousands of civilian vehicles. Sidewalks and pedestrian overpasses are required for realistic movement of pedestrians (including friendly and opposing dismounts). Parking lots are required for parking the simulated vehicles while their drivers are at work, in a restaurant or at the theater. Building function characterization is required to establish reasonable profiles for the civilian vehicles (e.g., from home to work to a restaurant and back home). Other features and attributes are important for visual simulation, including vegetation characteristics, surface materials of roofs, building facades, roads and other features, as well as pattern characterizations (for visual textures) of such features. Since buildings and other structures will take damage from fires, structural information is required to represent such damage in a physically realistic manner. Subterranean features are increasingly important in urban operations, and are expected to be utilized by the JSAF Federation within the next year.Although it may appear that nearly every geospatial data element in the urban environment could be incorporated, the authors have taken great care not to over-specify the requirements. A large number of both features and attributes in the various source data models considered were discarded as not meeting the criteria of being both useful and usable within the next year. Those that remain in the ‚ÄúGeneric AOI‚Äù and ‚ÄúGeneric Urban Backdrop‚Äù can be fully justified.As indicated by the reduction in features, attributes, and allowable values from our initial union to the JFCOM specifications (see Figure 4.1), much of the remaining work involved determining which elements to remove from the specifications.Consistency is critical ‚Äì consistency of attributes across features, consistency of collection criteria among similar features, and the internal consistency of eliminating multiple methods for representing the same semantic. Many rules of thumb drove the filtering process. Some filtering criteria and examples are included in Table 4.1.We tended to include features based upon categories of usefulness (e.g., current requirement by system(s), ability to enhance terrain, ability to impact mobility). Creating a geospecific profile of generic specification requires additional filtering rules (e.g., not required for location, not required for mission). While we sought to provide a superset of common requirements, specific locations and missions may need information beyond that described in the specifications. These specifications are a tool for describing needed content, not a rigid delineation of what is possible or useful.Table 4.1: Sample Filter CriteriaFilter because ‚Ä¶ExamplesMultiple representations sufficiently capture a semanticBreakwater and Breakwater/Groyne; Hardened Aircraft Shelter and Hangar with fortification attribute; Lighthouse and Building with building function attribute of lighthouseFeature is derivableRunway centerline (from runway areas), road curbline (from road centerline and width), causewayAttribute is derivableLength of linear features, area of areal featuresToo generic to be usefulMaritime Area, Miscellaneous Cultural FeatureUsefulness is beyond system capabilities*Power transmission line, lock gateToo dynamic**Campsite Not especially urbanHopsLow priorityRace track (use Road)NGA preference for FACCDriveway (use Road)Not essentialStore overhangGeometry is inappropriateSubstation/Transformer Yard points; Grain Bin/Silo lines (if these are large enough to care about collecting, they should be represented as an area)Sufficient information in super classLightning Rod (Tower designation is sufficient)Beyond required detailBlast Furnace (the function of the building is sufficient); Dumpster/refuse bin for urban background specificationInappropriate for logical data modelPhysical data model attributes such as ID* Current and near term capabilities including 2005 enhancements** Inclusion of operational elements necessitated that many dynamic features (such as tents, obstacles, rubble) remain in the specifications4.3 Collection GuidanceCollection criteria in TLM, MSD3, FFD, and 3D City Scene provided a starting point for defining feature collection criteria for the specifications. Using collection criteria intended for nominal scales smaller than that required for realistic simulations necessitated careful consideration of missing features and attributes. The lack of detailed MSD Level 4 and Level 5 collection criteria was a limitation.Consistent collection criteria necessitated definition of tiers of area features. These tiers set minimum collection sizes for features of similar character and use within synthetic natural environments. For example, features needed to appropriately restrict mobility (such as marshes and bogs) were determined to be collected where they are at least 200 square meters in size, but cropland smaller than a city block was considered less critical and, therefore, did not merit collection.When creating synthetic natural environments, source data generally undergoes significant editing. Collection guidance moves beyond collecting the right data to collecting the data in the right way.JSAF considers source deconfliction and topologic connectivity critical to fast track creation of terrain databases. Deconfliction requires buildings not overlap, roads not traverse through buildings or trees. Topologic connectivity requires that roads, cart tracks, trails, sidewalks, driveways, and parking lots form clean networks connected at coincident nodes. These requirements, among others, were incorporated into guidance documents.Figure 4.3 depicts an example of usable road centerline topology. The incorrect example shown in Figure 4.4 was drawn from a real topology discrepancy contained in our small area example data set. Should vehicles from the undivided road truly be required to turn and never enter the traffic circle?We adopted and/or adjusted criteria from MSD, FFD, TLM, and 3D City Scene to define collection criteria for all features in the EDMs. Adjustments shifted toward collecting smaller features in most cases. This is consistent with the differing notional scales of the existing criteria and our more detailed specifications for high resolution, cluttered urban environments.             SHAPE  \* MERGEFORMAT      		            SHAPE  \* MERGEFORMAT        Figure 4.3: Traffic Circle Example (CORRECT)		      Figure 4.4: Traffic Circle Example (INCORRECT)4.4 Interagency CollaborationOperating on a compressed time schedule necessitated concurrent efforts on the part of the JFCOM terrain team and NGA staff. Several strawman Environmental Data Models (EDMs) were produced to facilitate development of the JFCOM Urban Geospatial Specifications. When the groups got together, the terrain team typically proposed significantly more features and attributes and NGA sought to reconcile feature codes/attributes with the FACC data dictionary and GIFD . NGA expressed concerns about production cost and users expressed the need for high feature density and rich attribution.Occasional miscommunications occurred. For example, when JSAF sought a full, detailed description of the method of collection at an entire data set level, NGA proposed incorporation of GIFD feature level metadata. The evolving use of some feature codes was not fully captured in the specifications. Some messages were clearly understood. Road topology must be fully connected to permit simulation of extensive vehicle traffic. Gearing specifications toward existing practices could help mitigate cost. Roads and railroads must logically continue through tunnels and across bridges. Bridge widths must exceed the width of roads and railroads crossing those bridges, even when values are calculated based upon the quantity of lanes. 5. ProductsA spiral development methodology was used for the development of the evolving JFCOM Urban Geospatial Specifications. Spiral 1 ‚Äì a JFCOM Urban Geospatial Specification for a geospecific region of operational interest containing a military airfield and surrounding environs and represented by an NGA prototype data set. This region is significantly rural outside the airfield and a number of typically urban features are absent in this particular area.Spiral 2 ‚Äì a general JFCOM Urban Geospatial Specification for a high density Area of Interest (AOI) for urban data which can be easily tailored for specific content or production cost requirements (Generic AOI).Spiral 3 ‚Äì a general JFCOM Urban Geospatial Specification for an urban area outside the simulation AOI (Generic Backdrop). It is expected that for any particular exercise for which geospatial data is required, a tailored version of one of the generic specifications should be derived. Data elements judged of lesser importance (especially relative to extraction cost) should be omitted on a case-by-case basis. For example, while a characterization of soil type is important for simulated vehicle mobility, soil type is expensive to extract and vehicles are much less likely to stray from the road network in an urban area than in open terrain. Therefore, for a particular collection, soil type may well be omitted.Each specification incorporates both an EDM (features, attributes, attribute domains, and collection criteria) and a guidance document. EDMs maintain machine-parsable specifications on a database foundation. They are discussed further in section 4.2.Features and attributes were adjudicated in the EDMs, but time and funding did not permit full adjudication of attribute domains. Collection criteria were included for all features. Features, attributes, and collection criteria were scrubbed for consistency. Care was taken to avoid allowing representation of a single concept (semantic) as more than one feature in the EDM.Guidance documents are geared toward presenting a supplemental, human-readable reference to feature and attribute collection. They organize requirements into introductory remarks, buildings and structures, roads, railroads, air transportation, hydrography, feature intersections, other population, large area features, and additional features/attributes. The guidance organizes much of the feature and attribute information available in EDMs, presents examples to clarify collection criteria, describes topological connectivity requirements, and defines the set of features to be collected as 3D vectors.The following excerpt from the generic AOI specification provides an indication of the functionality being sought by JFCOM.7.1. Certain linear barriers should be collected:Collect linear barriers where they are greater than or equal to 25 meters long and meet the height requirements listed below. Small breaks and doors (less than 2 meters long) in linear barriers should be ignored when determining if walls and fences are long enough (25 meters) to be collected. Additionally, barriers that turn corners should sum the lengths of all segments of the barrier when determining whether to include the feature. Walls (AL260) and fences (AL070) at least 1.5 meters high should be collected. Revetments (GB050) and hedgerows (EA020) greater than or equal to 2 meters high should be collected. Revetments wider than 25 meters should be represented as areas. Hedgerows are broadly defined as rows of shrubbery planted as a fence, boundary, or windbreak. This definition does NOT include the bocage, a large terrain feature of Europe.Wall, revetment, and hedgerow lines require width (WID) measurements. Revetments require height (HGT) measurements. Walls, fences, and hedgerows require greater precision height measurements (PFG). Fence type (FTI) values should be collected on fences. FTI values for stone and rock are invalid. Features with such values would qualify as a wall instead. Record SMC for walls and revetments and record VEG on hedgerows [3]. Two key pieces of information are not associated with these specifications: importance rankings and collection costs. Although some general guidelines apply (transportation and structures are important), prioritization of features and attributes are driven by mission goals. Collection costs are highly sensitive to collection method (imagery, LIDAR), collection criteria, attribution richness, 3D coordinate requirements, and accessibility and topography of the locale.The developed specifications do not represent a panacea, but they do provide a framework for analyzing the content/cost tradeoffs.6. StatusThe JFCOM specifications represent a unique opportunity for M&S evaluation of source data requirements. Although Spiral 1 was completed within weeks, coordination of data collection and negotiated evolution of specifications has taken longer. Derivative products are guiding key pilot projects to determine production costs and provide utilization experience. NGA sought to take advantage of current production processes and placed a strong emphasis on FLDB data dictionary (an NGA profile of FACC), shifting the representation of certain semantics. Other negotiated changes include reduction of features and attributes, particularly those known to be difficult and expensive to collect. This effort has been synergistic with the continuing NGA development of Foundation-Based Operations, FBO, particularly the refining of MSD for urban area representation in MSD Level 4 and Level 5. The creation of self-consistent, simulation-centric AOI and urban background specifications for high density, cluttered environments has been a successful endeavor. The resulting specifications define detailed descriptions of JFCOM superset needs and create a framework for analyzing those needs against existing products. Additionally, this effort provided a foundation for evaluating needs against costs.5.
