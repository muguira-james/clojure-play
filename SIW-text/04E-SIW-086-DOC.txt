IntroductionIn the past aircraft have been procured and evolved through a discrete procurement cycle.  Acceptance of these has been defined by a set of point performance based criteria.  This has been primarily platform centric.We are now moving towards a far more integrated and incremental procurement cycle with the use of SEBA/SBA to support this.  Both requirements and acceptance are being defined in terms of operational or military capability. Measurement of what a particular equipment provides to the overall force is becoming the norm and the development of CONOPS in parallel with the equipment procurement is increasing.  Also platforms are not being considered in isolation but as part of a System of Systems.Together these form two major elements of thinking that need to be addressed concurrently.  Operational and technical aspects of the product are once again becoming integrated as they always should have been.Within BAE SYSTEMS we  have been considering a view which we described, unfortunately as Synthetic Environment.  The nine layer diagram below indicates a continuum of activity from the highest level of Geopolitical Analysis all the way through to the detailed design and manufacture of a particular product and its support system.  Within each of the layers are many instances of modelling, simulation and distributed simulation, each required for a particular purpose but all having an overall common context.Within this model the layers represent customer needs coming down from the top, with their current doctrinal context and solution concepts emerging from the bottom together with their means of delivery within individual industrial contexts.  Iteration of the various processes occurs at all levels but the most intense is that occuring through the middle layers as solutions are refined to provide fitness for purpose to the customer requirements. This change from performance/ equipment centric procurement to a capability based activity demands changes in our ways of thinking, operating and in the use of technology available to us for doing the work as opposed to the technology of the product.The current scope of the IBML project within Air Systems is indicated on the diagram across the three middle layers.Figure 1: Synthetic Environment (SE) Nine Layer ModelThe “9-Layer” model gave rise to the Defense Process model first mooted in the late 1990’s.  This took the SE concept model and mapped the four major uses of SE; i.e. Force Structure, Force Development, Training and Capability Acquistsion, to indicate their overlaps and inter-relationships.2. Modelling & Simulation RequirementsFigure 2: Defense Process ModelWithin the defence process the activities undertaken by IBML are located on the above diagram by the Tactical Analysis/ Wargaming -> Requirements Analysis - > Virtual Product Development - > Assessments/ Simulations loop as indicated by the yellow lines.   The aim of this activity is to ensure that this loop is as auditable and efficient (timely) as possible.  This approach also provides the ability to relate technical solutions in terms of operational effectiveness improvements, hopefully providing a technology ->  capability link.2. Modelling & Simulation Requirements To enable thechange from product to capability to occur, the way we evolve our engineering design and test must also change. This requires a more widespread consistent use of Modelling & Simulation and that M&S capability must be more flexible  providing:more efficient iteration through layers of modelling to enable full understanding of the implications of detailed design issues on military capability and to ensure earlier de-risking of integration issues.better traceability and re-use of models, simulations and analysis both between the engineering disciplines (aerodynamics, systems, ops analysis, manufacturing, flight test etc.) and across the product lifecycle.Reuse of models and simulations across the whole product lifecycle.  Modelling and Simulation used at the concept exploration stage and hence used to prioritise requirements must be the same as those used for acceptance if consistency is to be reached.As shown in Figures 1 and 2 the Integration Between modelling Layers activity has concentrated primarily on the issues related to integrating the high level Operational Analysis Models  (Campaign/ Mission) through the Engagement level modelling and HiTL (Human in the Loop) through to the more detailed engineering level models.  This is further expanded in Figure 3 showing how various aspects are covered off across Operational, Simulation and System domainsFigure 3: IBML Main FocusThis iterative integrated way of approaching both analysis and assessment with enhanced modelling and simulation capabilities brings with it a number of issues which need to be addressed:These have been grouped into:Culture – the willingness and ability to change established ways of working.Management Development – the control and input definitions for the process.Process Development- the iterative process itselfConfiguration Management – the assurance that all the elements of the process are configured properly and that the whole is consistent.2.1. Culture Within large Engineering companies, particularly on large projects there is still a reluctance to change working practice.  Many projects has tight time-scales and see changing the way they work as too high risk.   In addition changing working practices has to involve the customer both in understanding and being comfortable with the changes and possibly altering its own methods in conjunction.  Such changes are naturally difficult to insert into a project that has already undertaken to deliver a product by a given date and is already under pressure.  As a result  the IBML activity has spent time developing flexible, re-usable building blocks for projects to use and providing deployment and associated training to assist project use.  It has also progressed the use of Synthetic Environments and associated methodology into the company processes such as the Life Cycle Management and Engineering Life Cycle activities.  Early Life Cycle Projects have been used as Test Cases for this activity and have provided buy in to the processes.2.2 Management developmentFrequently the various groups involved in projects develop, for good reasons, a slightly different set of assumptions from each other.  More dangerously they tend to have a set of underwritten and almost perceived assumptions about how things are/  Such differences and mis-perceptions need to be managed and made consistent.  The use of visualisation is considered key to this and has been used extensively within the IBML project.  The ability to show a group of practitioners what is happening and why can provide significant benefit in crossing the various modelling domain and lifecycle stages.2.3  Process Development  Process development refers back to the need not just for a local process for the particular phase of the lifecycle – a process aimed at getting an answer – but at the long lifecycle process of being able to reuse models and simulations across the modelling layers consistently at all stages of the lifecycle.  The capability to refer back to the original set of scenarios that defined the overall operational need should be readily available in order to assess any proposed changes.  This in itself spins off other issues regarding funding for scenario retention and development.  Similarly the issue of consistency of future scenarios across the product life-cycle where our perception of the  Figure 4:  IBML M&S iteration and capability assessment of proposed conceptsThe figure above shows the area addressed by IBML in the centre.  This “consistent” M&S capability is centre to the design process being used for Requirements capture/ refinement, concept evaluation in an appropriate operation environment and concept refinement.2.4. Configuration ManagementModels and Simulations are of themselves meaningless unless there is a credible and consistent V&V process that can be shown to have been used and that there is clear traceability for the status of each element in the process.  On this subject of Confuguration Management the IBML project has attempted to ensure;Common V&V techniques are applied across the various models and simulations.Consistency of Data across the simualtions (this and the previous item are covered in more detail in paper 04E-SIW-082)An initial view of Asset and model characterisation requirements. 3. IBML in UseThe IBML study has been developed as one of BAE SYSTEMS Air Systems research programmes.  Offline OA models were used to provide the initial inputs, the process and models were “run” and the whole activity involved the concept design team.  The results both of the study and of the change in working practices has been very positive as have the reactions of our customers.  The “I see now what you mean” is alive and well and promising benefit for the future.Author BiographiesALISON HEMINSLEY is a Senior Operational Analyst at BAE SYSTEMS in Warton, Lancashire. She has been with the department since 1988 and has been involved in Modelling and Simulation and Synthetic Environment activities since the early 1990’s
