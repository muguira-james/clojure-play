NPOESS is considered to be this country's next-generation polar orbiting environmental satellite system.  It will provide weather and other environmental data at resolutions much higher than possible with today's polar orbiting satellites.  Resolution of many of its observed parameters, including soil moisture, will be as high as 1 kilometer under certain conditions.    In order to quantify tactical utility the Army will acquire from the use of the high-resolution soil moisture data, the NPOESS Integrated Program Office asked the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) and the Corps of Engineers Engineering Research and Development Center (ERDC) to conduct a collaborative study.   The investigation was concerned with resolution of soil moisture/strength information and the effects on vehicle mobility and ultimately battlefield metrics.    Three tactical scenarios including breaching operations, hasty defense and pursuit, were evaluated.  The combat scenario was developed using a high-resolution combat model, JSAF version 5.7, as developed by the Defense Modeling and Simulation Office under the Envirofed III program.  Spatial and temporal changes in the digital dirt were conducted to evaluate the usefulness of knowledge of the soil moisture to tactical operations.  Measures of effectiveness including momentum, speed, and time of battle, fuel consumption, and attrition were included in the study to detail differences between the outcomes of each scenario because of differing terrain conditionsIntroductionDescribed herein is a study that quantifies the tactical utility of soil information the Army will acquire by using the soil moisture data measured by NPOESS.  Tactical utility is evaluated in terms of the Army’s need to have soil moisture data available to assess soil strength and its consequential effect on vehicle mobility and trafficability.  This work was sponsored by the NPOESS Integrated Program Office (IPO) and conducted as a collaborative effort between the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Delphi, Maryland and the Army Corps of Engineers’ Research and Development Center (ERDC), Vicksburg, Mississippi.  A series of experiments were performed using an enhanced version of Joint Semi-Automated Forces Model (JSAF), a computer-simulated war gaming environment.   This model acts as a virtual laboratory that allows systematic understanding and quantification of how the timely delivery of high-resolution soil moisture data will affect the outcome of combat scenarios.  To this end, we established parameters for the soil information and vehicles relating to the weather conditions.  Four combat scenarios were implemented representing typical maneuver-oriented operations:  hasty defense, hasty breach, pursuit, and long pursuit.  Soil moisture is treated as an environmental variable, defined as one of these five states:  dry, average, wet and wet-slippery.  These soil moisture conditions correlate to specific soil strength values that have a direct effect on mobility and trafficability.  Outcomes of the combat simulations are analyzed using four measures of effectiveness (MOEs): average speed, maximum momentum, fuel consumption, and attrition rate. BackgroundSoil moisture is a key attribute in predicting changes in weather on agricultural and mobility.  The NPOESS Integrated Operational Requirements Document II (IORD II) [6] identifies the measurement of soil moisture as a key performance parameter (KPP). The KPP designation means that if the threshold specification for the parameter is not met, then there is cause for the system to be re-evaluated or the program to be reassessed or terminated.   This designation defines the importance the Army attaches to the requirement of NPOESS to collect soil moisture data.  The utility of these data is dependent upon its spatial horizontal and temporal resolution.  The NPOESS will increase the tactical utility of the soil moisture data by providing it at a higher temporal and spatial horzontal resolution compared to the data sources currently available.Today potential sources of soil moisture data for use by the tactical Army include point measurements by weather and agricultural stations as well as by Army tactical engineer technicians, archived climatological data, the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), and 3-hour soil moisture analyses available from the Air Force Weather Agency’s (AFWA) agriculture meteorology model (AGRMET) [3] (Figure 1).  Data from all of these sources are of limited value to the Army for a variety of reasons.  Measurement through weather stations or other field observers provide point data that do not reflect the conditions over the dimensions typical of a battlefield.  In addition, these measurements are difficult to obtain in hostile regions.  Climatological statistics for the soil moisture will usually be available for stations or grid points that are widely separated in space.  These data, although useful for long term planning, suffer from the fact they represent and describe average values which in actuality only rarely occur.  The DMSP Special Sensor Microwave Imager SSMI soil moisture data have a validated resolution of 50 km [5].  The SSM/I soil moisture retrievals can be useful in desert, or sparsely vegetated regions, and in heavily cultivated areas during the non-growing season when the crop has been removed.  These retrievals are less useful in moderate to heavily vegetated areas  (e.g., moderate -heavy grass or forested areas).  The SSMI is only sensitive to soil moisture in the top 1-2 mm of soil, when the sensor can clearly 'see' the soil [Paul McCrone, Air Force Weather Agency].  The AGRMET model is configured with four soil layers (10, 30, 60 and 100 cm) and outputs volumetric soil moisture data in a 47-km gridded field every three hours.  Although these have been operationally available for ten years, they are still not available to the Army’s battlefield planners due to some interoperability problems between systems.  The  primary limitations of the AGRMET soil moisture data are: 1) the model is very sensitive to precipitation and accurate spatial/temporal precipitation analyses is often difficult to obtain and 2) the model requires input from various observational systems and numerical weather prediction models and thus inherits all of their limitations [4].  Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 1.  AGRMET generated soil moisture map.The user-based requirements for the NPOESS soil moisture sensing capability, as described in the IORD II, address many of the shortcomings of the data now available for supporting Army operations.  The IORD II requirements shown in Table 1 are described in terms of threshold and objective performance characteristics.  The threshold characteristics are given as the minimum performance requirement, while the objective specifications are given as the desired performance requirement.  Review of this table reveals that if only the threshold specifications are achieved, NPOESS soil moisture sensing capability still represents a major improvement over DMSP and other direct measurement capabilities for battlefield applications.  For example, under clear nadir conditions NPOESS will provide soil moisture data in a horizontal cell size of 1 km, which compares very favorably to the 50 km cell size of the DMSP data.  Table 1.

This model is designed to operate in a distributed mode where it can interact with the output of other models or databases.  The study was conducted in two phases.  The first phase consisted of four experiments that address the very basic and important question of whether differences in soil strength conditions created by changes in soil moisture can significantly alter the outcome of a maneuver-oriented battle.  In the second phase, the experiments were designed to specifically quantify how changes in the horizontal spatial resolution of the soil moisture data (i.e. soil strength) impact the outcome of the three battlefield scenarios.  The first-phase experiments include a series of simulations that quantify the impact that the changes in soil strength had on the outcome of a given military scenario.  Simulations were run for each of the four soil strength conditions with the soil strength remaining uniform throughout execution of a given combat simulation.  These soil strength conditions were tested in each of the four military scenarios.  Every combination of military scenario and environmental condition was simulated four times to identify the range of stochastic variability inherent within the simulation system.  Time restraints played heavily in restricting the number of runs to four.  	The second-phase experiments used the gridded soil strength data.  These data were available with horizontal grid cell sizes of 67.5 km and 2.5 km.  The gridded data sizes were used to establish a better correlation between the horizontal resolution of the soil moisture data and its impact on the outcome of the combat simulation.DESCRIPTION OF SIMULATION MODELS AND DATABASESThe military scenarios were generated using the Joint Semi Automated Force (JSAF) version 5.7 with a Camp Pendleton, California Compact Terrain Data Base (CTDB) version 7. TheJSAF is an event-based combat simulation model.  It is also a descriptive model in that it runs the outcomes of simulation to an end state and allows outside analysts to determine the meaning of the outcome.  Simply put, the outcome of the simulation must be examined and interpreted by an outside human source to yield the appropriate reasons for the outcomes.  It is also a discrete model as it treats events in set time steps and event outcomes.At the vehicle weapon systems level, the JSAF software vehicles are able to execute a realistic range of basic actions.  For example, as vehicles experience damage, expend fuel and traverse difficult terrain, the model is capable of adjusting their performance an thus the probability of successful execution of order as appropriate.  Similarly, weapon systems exhibit realistic rates of fire and trajectories.  Other simulated capabilities include:  target detection, target identification, target selection, fire planning, and collision avoidance [10].   The JSAF is an open simulation allowing for continual update by outside (human) input of assigned objective  missions and locations of execution.  Even though JSAF is an open loop model, for the purpose of the NPOESS evaluation the scenarios are not modified once the simulation begins.  Each scenario is allowed to run to term with the appropriate soil conditions to allow consistent analysis of these corresponding effects. The JSAF was modified to include a mobility model that reacts to soil strength variations [1].  Figure 2 illustrates the tractive force-speed curve of a vehicle.  The relationship between this force and the speed of the vehicle supports modeling of the movement of the vehicle across soil.  The area under the curve identified as motion resistance changes when the vehicle begins to travel across soft soils.  Other forces affecting speed may be a result of slope, vegetation override, and obstacles, or a combination of these parameters.  Figure  SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 2.  Tractive Force vs Speed Curve	The CTDB was modified to include attribution for moisture and soil strength at the surface and subsurface of each polygon[7].  The predominate soil type used for this scenario was a  Lean Clay (CL).  JSAF is an event-based combat simulation model.  Time steps for the scenario runs are at 64 milliseconds.  Each scenario is less than 8 hours and movement rates are modeled at the individual vehicle level.  There were four military scenarios defining heavy tank maneuvers in a short and long pursuit, defense, and breach operations.  The maneuvers were centered on an air base at the southern end of Camp Pendleton near the ocean shore.DESCRIPTION OF MILITARY SCENARIOSFour military scenarios are derived from three basic tactical missions that were released by the U.S Army Training and Doctrine Command’s (TRADOC’s ) Analysis Command  - White Sands Missile Range (TRAC – WSMR).  These scenarios have a heavy dependence on mobility and provided the ability to freely maneuver on the battlefield [2].  These missions are pursuit, hasty defense and hasty breach.  These three missions were used by the ERDC to build four scenario templates implemented in our simulations.  These missions include both a blue (friendly) and red  (enemy) force structure.   To constrain the length of this paper, the pursuit scenario is the only scenario discussed.  The pursuit scenario for the gridded and uniform condition (67.5 resolution grid) is illustrated in Figure 3.  Three soil strength conditions are shown (Dry- Green, Average – Brown, Wet-Slippery-Red).  The other scenarios tended to follow the same trends shown herein.Figure 3.  Pursuit scenario for Camp PendletonCamp Pendleton, CA was selected as the regional setting for all four military scenarios.  Its selection was based on the availability of a high-resolution terrain database required by the JSAF simulation. The dynamic terrain features, which exist in the SAF as a separate feature database, were also available within the Camp Pendleton database.  In the JSAF dynamic terrain simulation module (DTSIM), the environmental features that are capable of affecting the mobility behavior of the vehicles include soil strength, obstacles, vegetative cover, and slope of the terrain.  The focus of this study was on soil strength as defined by the soil type, and the amount of surface soil moisture.   Four different soil strength conditions:  dry, average, wet, and wet-slippery were used in the simulations.  These conditions are defined in terms of the rating cone index (RCI) given for each of two layers within a 30–cm soil profile:  the surface (0 –3 cm) and subsurface (3 – 30 cm).  Table 1 shows the surface and subsurface RCI values for each of the four soil strength conditions.  For this study, surface soil strengths less than a 50-cone index, categorized the area as wet-slippery.  	Table 2.  Definition of Soil Strength CategoriesSoil Strength ConditionSurface Layer (0 –3  cm)Subsurface Layer (3 – 30 cm)Dry300300Average150200Wet15060Wet-slippery2060 The rating cone index (RCI) is an index of shearing resistance or  bearing capacity of the soil corrected for soil remolding by type and can be expressed in pounds per square inch (psi) [8].  The vehicle contact pressure is measured as the weight of the vehicle divided by the contact area of the wheels or tracks.  There is strong correlation between these two values.  Figure 4 illustrates vehicles whose mobility index as expressed as a contact pressure is increasing (x-axis) as related to their minimum soil strength requirement for one pass as indicated in the y-axis.   Soil strength predictions or measurements provided quick assessments of a vehicles performance off-road.  The relationship between tractive force and soil strength is illustrated in Figure 5.	Figure 4.  Soil strength vs. contact pressure for one pass for military tracked vehicles.In phase II of the study, gridded fields of spatially-varying soil strength data represented the soil strength conditions. These data fields had horizontal cell sizes of 2.5 km and 67.5 km. When executing a simulation, the soil strength was gridded.  In order to increase the realism of these simulations, a previous rain event that occurred over the Camp Pendleton region was recreated using the numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. The rain event was selected based on its potential to create a variable soil moisture distribution pattern over the region represented in our simulation.  The rain event was selected from a three-year archive of atmospheric data.  The differences in soil moisture would ensure differences in soil strength since the soil type was constant over the area of interest.     EMBED Excel.Chart.8 \s Figure 5.  Comparison of Slippery vs. Normal Surface Vehicle TractionInternet-based environmental scenario generator (ESG) [4] was used as the search tool to identify the dates of precipitation events that had the potential for significantly changing the soil strength conditions.  The date identified was 25 January 1999.  The hourly precipitation associated with this event was then recreated by running the MM5 Numerical Weather Prediction model initialized with some archived atmospheric data.  MM5 output its data in the same four horizontal grid cell sizes that were used for the soil strength data.  Having the hourly precipitation and knowledge about the soil type in the Camp Pendleton region, the soil strength for each of the grid points was calculated using a model called Short-Term Operational Forecasts of Trafficability (SOFT).  The SOFT is a model that can be used with JSAF to change the soil strength as a function of changing weather conditions [8,9].Data Collection and ProcessingEach battle simulation was run with four different environmental scenarios: dry, average, wet, and wet-slippery.   The models comprising the combat simulation were configured according to the Defense Modeling and Simulation Office’s  EnviroFed Federation.  This federation consists of three individual federate models (DTSim, JSAF, and ModStealth) running at the same time and communicating through the High-level Architecture, Run-time Interface, 1.3V3.  The federates consisted of JSAF, which controlled movement of the vehicles, Hydrosim which categorized areas of the CTDB by population of the soil strength attributes, and Modstealth which was used to view the vehicles in 3D. ANALYSIS OF SIMULATION DATA	The four MOE’s used for our analysis were fuel consumption, attrition, average speed of vehicles and momentum.  Fuel consumption is a very relevant MOE for assessing impacts on logistics since refueling requires the availability of fuel, manpower, and time.  Thus, it often can be tactically advantageous for the battlefield commander to exploit situations that will minimize his refueling requirements and /or maximize the enemies’ refueling requirements.  Fuel consumption algorithms in the JSAF simulation model are only related to time increments and do not currently account for environmental conditions that cause changes in a vehicle’s fuel consumption.  Therefore, a more realistic assessment of how soil strength conditions impact fuel consumption was obtained by determining the available traction for a vehicle in a dry, average, wet, and wet-slippery condition and assuming a relative difference in linear fuel consumption (Figure 6).   EMBED Excel.Chart.8 \s Figure 6.  Relative Changes in Fuel Efficiency of a M1 TankThe relationship between dry, average, wet, and wet-slippery is based on relative differences in motion resistance or sinkage of the vehicle, which translate to relative differences in traction.  As indicated in Figure 6, a vehicle operating in a wet-slippery scenario will achieve only 20 percent of the fuel efficiency of the same vehicle operating in a dry condition.  	Attrition is the MOE we used to characterize battlefield survivability/lethality.  The attrition calculations show the percent of the total number of vehicles of the blue and red Force structures that were killed by hostile fire during the simulated battle.  Obviously, the intent is to exploit situations that are most favorable for minimizing Blue Force attrition and maximizing Red Force attrition.  The results compare the Blue and Red Force attrition values for each of the four soil strength conditions in Figure 7.Figure 7.  Attrition for four Scenario Conditions	The average-speed-of-vehicles MOE is an indicator of battlefield tempo.  Battlefield tempo is important because if the Blue Force can accomplish their mission at a higher tempo, the Red Force will have less opportunity to implement an effective counter-maneuver.  In addition, a higher tempo will more quickly allow the resources of the Blue Force to be committed to other missions.  This MOE was calculated by averaging the speed of all of the vehicles that have not been designated as killed.  This calculation included vehicles that are immobilized because they are stuck in the mud or prevented from moving due to mission requirements or other natural environmental conditions.  Data for this MOE were collected according to time and the results compare how the Blue and Red Forces were affected by the four different soil strength conditions used in the simulations.  Figure 8 illustrates decreases in speed with decreases in soil strength.    Figure 8.  Average Speed of Units for Various Scenarios	 Momentum is another MOE related to battlefield tempo.  It was calculated by totaling the distance moved by all the vehicles of the Blue and Red Forces from the beginning to the end of battle.  Momentum normally also includes the mass of the vehicles, but in this situation it did not because the majority of the vehicles were M1 Tanks having the same mass.  The results of this MOE compare momentum vs. time for the Blue and Red Forces under each of the four soil strength conditions.  Figure 9 illustrates decreases in momentum as a direct function of soil strength conditions.Figure 9.  Change in Momentum for Various Scenarios	The analysis above was based on 67.5 km resolution data, which covered the entire area of Camp Pendleton.  The higher resolution 2.5 km created pockets of wet slippery areas and overlapping dry areas.  Figure 10 illustrates some results from the gridded runs.  The 2.5 km resolution data provided initially higher speeds for the Blue forces.  However, wet-slippery conditions were defined in the mountain passes.  These were critical areas of mobility after the first 60 minutes of pursuit.  The speed of the units was degraded and the advancement halted.   Figure 10.  Gridded vs. Non-Gridded Simulation9.  SUMMARY	This study examined the utility of the  improved collection of soil moisture data for military purposes made possible by the NPOESS.  The added utility of the NPOESS soil moisture collection capability was examined by conducting a series of controlled simulation experiments using the JSAF combat simulation model.  Simulations were made using a combination of different soil strengths and military scenarios.   	This paper only summarizes results obtained from the pursuit military scenario.  For the pursuit scenario it was determined that movement rates, momentum, attrition rates, and fuel efficiency were all affected by soil strength changes.    Simulations  comparing gridded versus non-gridded data were also undertaken .  In this comparison, the 67.5 kilometer data was considered non-gridded since it covered the entire area of interest and  a 2.5 kilometer data set was  considered high-resolution gridded  information.   The simulations recorded a significant difference in the velocity of the units when operating under gridded and non-gridded conditions.  In total the study results demonstrated that the Army can acquire a very definitive tactical advantage if it makes use of the NPOESS soil moisture data.   10.  REFERENCES[1] BDM International, Inc.
