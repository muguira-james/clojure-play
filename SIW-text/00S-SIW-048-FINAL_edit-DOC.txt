In its simplest form, IO is the ability to defend one's own information infrastructures from attack and disruption while at the same time being able to inflict such damage upon the opposition's infrastructure in a cohesive manner to facilitate achievement of operational objectives.  What fully constitutes IO is continually evolving, as is associated doctrine. The formal and most simple definition of IO is provided by Joint Publication 3-13, which states that, "Information Operations are actions taken to affect adversary information and information systems while defending one's own information and information systems."There are a variety of capabilities and activities that have developed mostly independent of each other over the years which are now considered to constitute the fundamental aspects of IO.  Figure 1.1-1 depicts a taxonomy of these capabilities which has gained increased acceptance, where this particular graphic was developed in US Army channels.Below is an Army-centric description of each of these aspects of IO.  A key challenge of IO is integrating and synchronizing these activities:Public Affairs is the news reporting arm of the Army.  Their correspondents are bound to report only the facts, though some must be censored to protect Deception operations and to maintain Operations Security.Civil Affairs deals at the Army interface with host nation governmental and other non-governmental organizations.  Examples of civil efforts are: negotiations for air time to broadcast messages, working with the local police to develop an agreeable, commonly understood perception of shared responsibilities, and contracting for host nation private industry support services.Physical Destruction is pretty well understood, and to the degree that simulations represent features such as tactical operations centers (TOCs), sensors, networks, etc. as targetable entities, one can model it fairly accurately, but the challenge is modeling the effects of physical destruction on the flow of information to the decision-makers.Electronic Warfare encompasses a host of offensive and defensive techniques including suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD), communications jamming, and the use of intelligence gathering platforms for targeting or threat avoidance.Psychological Operations (PSYOP) are actions taken to influence the emotions, motives, objective reasoning and ultimately the behavior of governments, organizations, groups, and individuals.  The purpose is to induce or reinforce attitudes and behaviors favorable to U.S. military objectives.Computer Network Defense and Attack (CND & CNA) are two relatively recent additions to the IO arsenal.  Differentiating from physical attack, CND and CNA focus on defending one's own networks from attack or attacking another organization's networks via electronic means. This is a diverse and growing field, which includes activities such as denial of service, data corruption, spoofing, etc.Figure 1.1-1.  Fundamental aspects of IOThe integration and application of these various IO techniques has two principal targets, as depicted in Figure 1.1-2: One target is represented by the lens through which the commanders perceive the battlespace, as pictured in this graphic.  One must keep the lens clear for coalition commanders and staff (defensive IO)  while clouding selected portions of the enemy commanders lens, inserting false images, and the like.The second target is the mind of the commander, packaging information to best fit the individual needs and decision making styles of coalition commanders while employing offensive IO to induce enemy commanders to make ill-considered decisions based on emotion.  PSYOP could be one tool to achieve this objective.  For example, it might be possible to cause the enemy commander to develop a distrust of some key advisors, or make him want to ‚Äúpunish‚Äù coalition forces in a particular area (an action one  would anticipate and prepare for).Figure 1.1-2  Targets of IO ActivitiesOverview of IO M&SThe realm of IO modeling and simulation (M&S) is in its infancy, which is to be expected, as IO itself is an arena which is under rapid change and still immature in many ways.  It is important  to portray IO in M&S tools as well as one  can, while recognizing that progress may initially be slow given the truism that one  cannot model that which one  does not understand.  It is also important to recognize that there are certain inherent limitations which will limit one's ability to model IO and its effects in even a pseudo-deterministic fashion, particularly in regard to the ability to model the set of ‚Äúsoft factors‚Äù which directly influence the selection and effectiveness of IO tools of the trade.It does seem clear, though, that essential aspects of most any IO M&S tool include the following:Communications modeling: IO modeling requires links and nodes of communications architectures, and the resulting vulnerability of these architectures to disruption of the associated links and nodes.  There are numerous COTS products available which can support such analyses at various levels of resolution.  Additionally, there have been various government efforts to both leverage these COTS tools as well as develop new tools to address unique IO communications architecture issues.Military Decision Making and Situational Awareness modeling: The goal here is to simulate human (and machine) behaviors that result in a perception, decision, action, or plan.  As will be described later in this paper, there are several projects underway across the government attempting to characterize this phenomena.  Much progress has been made, though given the human behavioral and personality influence of such decision processes, this is an inexact science at best.PSYOP and Civil Affairs modeling:  Such activities may target commanders and their staff,  the general population or specific cultural/societal groups.  These activities are also an inexact science.  The cause and effect relationship is a function of numerous factors including individual parameters (leadership, decision making, and interpersonal styles) as well as the specific cultural/technological context and prevailing characteristics, tendencies and moods of society.  Additionally, the behavior of collections of entities is not simple aggregates of individual behaviors.  This is a field that has much room for progress, requiring significant data to show effects of these IO aspects.  Figure 1.2-1 captures these various IO M&S requirements in a single graphic.  The overall goal of most any IO M&S tool is to be able to algorithmically represent within a simulation tool the impact of  IO activities (as described in the green arrow of Figure 1.2-1) upon operational outcomes so as to support various trade-off analyses as well as to provide a mechanism to train our Warfighters.Figure 1.2-1  Summary of IO M&S RequirementsOverview of paperThis paper provides an overview of recent attempts to characterize the diverse aspects of IO M&S,  and discusses areas that provide fertile ground for the  promulgation of standards to facilitate IO M&S in the future.In particular, this paper first summarizes conclusions from a recent survey of IO M&S tools conducted by the Defense Technical Information Center's (DTIC) Information Assurance Technology Analysis Center (IATAC).  Next, this paper summarizes a recent meeting from the US Army's Information Superiority Integrated Concept Team (IS ICT), Working Group #4, which has a charter focused on defining and resolving critical issues for the future of Army IO M&S.IATAC Report on IA M&SPurposeIn December 1997, the IATAC published a report entitled, "Modeling & Simulation Activities in Support of Information Assurance."  The purpose of this report was to describe, "... the models, simulations, and tools developed by those (government) organizations chartered with the IA (Information Assurance) mission."   This IATAC report, although several years old now, is important not just for those tools which it discovered and documented, but more so for the gaps which were discovered and overarching issues identified relative to IA M&S tools.  Although much activity has occurred in the development of new tools in the intervening years, the situation and issues described in this IATAC report  are not much different today.  (Note: for the purposes of this report, IA is considered to be a subset of IO.  Issues related to IA M&S tools are accordingly considered to be relevant to IO M&S tools.)Summary of major findingsThis IATAC report attempted to first differentiate between IA tools and IA M&S tools.  The former are tools that reside on networks with the explicit purpose of providing  IA monitoring, detection, response and overall system security of real-world, operational systems.  On the other hand, IA M&S tools can be used to analyze a variety of issues related to these real-world operational systems in an off-line, non-disruptive manner.  Such analyses may investigate the vulnerability of a system to very specific threats, or may look at more macroscopic effects such as the impact of various IA protection measures upon the system's overall contribution to a Warfighter's operational mission.The overall conclusions of this IATAC report pertain to both IA tools as well as IA M&S tools, and were as follows:   1.  Future warfighting capabilities depend on IA   2.  Metrics are needed for IA assessments   3.  Additional modeling and simulation tools are         needed to support IA   4.  IA modeling and simulation capabilities are         nascent   5. Effective IA tools require protection   6.  Unclassified systems offer only parity with the         hacker community   7.  Classified IS modeling and simulation studies are         required.Of specific relevance to the IO M&S community, this report provided the following more detailed and still pertinent conclusions:a.  "To facilitate the development of appropriate models, simulations, and tools for IA, it is imperative to understand the many offensive capabilities within our own arsenal, and those of our adversaries. ...The IA community would benefit from knowing what offensive capabilities exist or are in development, and whether any known countermeasures or IA mechanism exists to protect information or information systems from such an attack."  (That is to say, you  can not model what you can not define.)b. "...there needs to be an agreed taxonomy for the IA mission area, as well as an agreed set of metrics ...  The taxonomy would ensure that the simulation decomposes and represents the key issues relative to IA in an agreed manner; the metrics would enable the simulation to be developed to a sufficient level of detail in its representation of the real world ... Little information or discussion seems publicly available regarding the definition and common use of an agreed set of metrics for IA activities."  (That is to say, to model it, one  must agree on what it is and how to measure its effect.)c.  "...there has yet to emerge any widely accepted or widely applicable set of IA models, simulations or tools, as evidenced by this survey."As supported by the below more recent review of IO M&S tools, these conclusions still ring true today.July 99 Meeting of the US Army's IS ICT, Working Group #4 on IO M&SA meeting was held on 21-22 July 99 at Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas, of the US Army's Information Superiority Integrated Concept Team (IS ICT) Work Group #4,  Modeling and Simulation.  The meeting was hosted by the U.S. Army's Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Analysis Center (TRAC).  The mission of this working group is to, "... determine requirements for IO portrayal in M&S spanning TEMO (Training, Exercise and Military Operations), ACR (Advanced Concepts Requirements) and RDA (Research, Development and Acquisition) domains and develop an overall strategy for near, mid and far-term initiatives."One objective of the meeting this past July was to, "link IO M&S requirements definers with those who can speak to M&S capabilities."  Numerous different government as well as contractor organizations that possess various forms of IO M&S tools were invited to discuss and showcase their wares with members of the Work Group.3.1  Meeting SummaryBriefings spanned the spectrum of IO training tools, IO analysis tools, IO M&S research and Foreign Forces databases (that could support IO M&S).Each tool that was discussed appeared to employ unique factors in accounting for the modeling of the effects of IO operations upon adversary infrastructures.Several of the IO M&S tools demonstrated at the end of the first day had similar presentations to the user, with map/terrain data overlaid with icons that could change color as the scenario advanced and pull-down menus of factors that drove the underlying IO effects algorithms.  The first day concluded with a series of IO M&S demonstrations that primarily focused on support to the Training, Exercise and Military Operations (TEMO) domain.  The demonstrations reinforced the need for quantifiable data to accurately calculate the effects of diverse information operations and the integration of all the elements of IO. Summary of Tool Strengths:  Significant progress in researching and quantifying IO has been made during the past year.  MACE, Spectrum, and other systems offer potential for beneficial use by IO planners and trainers, however they do not reflect the integration of IO elements at this time. C2WARS and other analytical efforts to model human behavior are developing the requisite data for modeling this elusive area of IO.  Summary of Tool Weaknesses: Lacking quantifiable and validated data and IO algorithms, the systems do not appear to have the ability to reliably calculate the effects of IO, causing a continued reliance on man-in-the-loop expertise.  Also, not only do the tools not talk to each other, it is difficult for the people to talk to each other in terms of understanding just what "your" tool does that can help "me" address "my" problem.Conclusions: Although not strictly just an IO M&S issue, but more of an issue for the larger IO community, the meeting concluded with general acknowledgement that there needs to be some overarching, guiding taxonomy of IO from which the community can begin to articulate specific M&S requirements, and from such requirements, one can then map existing tools to understand where the gaps are.Overview of Briefings PresentedConcept for IO Staff Training - Bill Myers/John Harrington, TRWPresentation: The briefing discussed how an ongoing Army Staff Conduct of Fire Trainer (COFT) device could be leveraged to provide collective Staff-level IO training.  This would provide a very limited, bounded, 90 minute training scenario wherein the Commander has very specific training objectives. Discussion/Observations:Does not have a free play enemy; the Commander decides up front what training he wants to have occur, which requires a priori definition of scenario scripts and branches/sequels to training audience actions. Assessment of impact of IO is largely determined by human  Observer/ Controllers.  This tool is designed to train IO cell staff.  It should enable a commander to bring in his staff and train them using their fielded Army Battle Command System hardware/software devices. Lack of a community-agreed upon overarching spectrum of IO training tool requirements, audiences and metrics complicates the task of determining where this tool could fit into such a spectrum.C2 Conceptual Modeling - Janet Morrow, National Ground Intelligence Center (NGIC)Presentation:NGIC has down-selected to six different templates to represent the command and control (C2) decision processes of most any of 186 nations.  NGIC is using a commercial systems analysis product called CORE to diagram these decision flow processes.  Initial data is now available via the DIA unclassified and classified M&S Resource Repository (MSRR) node.  NGIC is also working on capturing behavioral data to be made available at some later date.  Discussion:Although not directly related to IO M&S, these templates developed by NGIC can assist model developers who are attempting to represent the effect of Blue Force IO activities upon an Opposing Force (OPFOR) by providing some means to represent the OPFOR C2 decision process which the Blue Force IO activities are attempting to disrupt.These "fixed" templates do not accommodate changes in Opposing Force (OPFOR) doctrine that may occur during an exercise or simulation run as a dynamic reaction to Blue IO activity since they are only a conceptual model/template to assist model developers.  It is up to the model developer if it is decided that OPFOR behavior needs to change during the course of simulation execution from one template to another.USA Special Operations Command (USASOC) Rqmts for IO Training in OOTW  - Dean Rose, US Army Special Operations Battle LabPresentation:This briefing presented a long and diverse set of IO M&S requirements from the perspective of the  U.S. Army's Special Operations Forces (ARSOF), ranging from micro resolution analyses (e.g., analysis of the type of network controllers for utilities) to macro resolution (e.g., the effect of psychological operations (PSYOP) products on the general population).  The briefing presented a long list of detailed PSYOP-related M&S requirements.  To illustrate the importance of including PSYOP in M&S tools, it was mentioned that in Desert Storm, US forces conducted months of PSYOP before they actually began the operation, although typical theater-level analysis models only start with the actual operation.  Discussion:No mention was made of what steps are being taken to address any of these various needs.  There are no overarching standard set of PSYOP metrics to be able to decide whether to invest in PSYOP as opposed to communications disruption.  Such analyses are performed on a case-by-case basis.C2WARS - Mr. Jerry Schweitzer,  CECOM (Communications and Electronics Command) Intelligence & IO Directorate, Ft. Monmouth, NJ; Dr. Eva Hudlicka, Psychometrix Associates; and Mr. Greg Zacharias, Charles River Analytics Presentation: The Command and Control Warfare Analysis and Reasoning System (C2WARS) is funded under the small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program.  The overall objective of C2WARS is to provide an analysis tool that provides insights which can enable us to influence an adversary‚Äôs decision-making process so as to affect, disrupt an/or destroy the achievement of his/her goals.  The focus of C2WARS research to achieve this objective is to (1) examine the relationship between the leadership decision-making profiles and the information infrastructure used by the leadership, and then (2) use this relationship to determine potential courses of action (COA) of the adversary and recommended friendly COAs necessary to influence the adversary.C2WARS attempts to achieve this by representing the various human factors affecting the commander's decision processes.  It considers the commander's vulnerabilities, how to "attack" them, and how it will effect him, not in terms of equipment, but in terms of how he bases and makes decisions.  This development is based upon Rasmussen's hierarchy of human information processing, which attempts to develop relations between: Behaviors - Beliefs - Perceptions - Data - Sources, as effected by the Goals and Affective State (of the individual decision maker).Discussion:What is being presented is not a simulation that will solve anyone's unique problem, but rather a detailed methodology that describes a variety of parameters and psychosocial data, that can then be linked to how such data drive performance/vulnerabilities.This tool provides a detailed approach to modeling the Commander/staff/nation behaviors and responses to IO, when, for example, at the theater level, one is concerned with how this all rolls up into whether the median for the expected behavior has been modified.  This could help lead to a methodology to drive predictions of such aggregate behaviors.The level of detail is so great, though, that it may be difficult if not impossible to acquire all the data and responses/vulnerabilities needed to adequately populate this tool.Command Decision Modeling (CDM) - Sean MacKinnon, National Simulation Center (NSC)Presentation:CDM is defined as, "Procedures, practices, processes, techniques, data, and algorithms that model or simulate human or automated behavior that result in a perception, a decision, an action or reaction, or a plan."  FY01-07 requirements of the CDM program are to be able to encapsulate in software the following command decision processes: (1) Understand Orders, (2) Assess Situation (METT-T), (3) Develop Plan, (4) Issue Orders, (5) Receive and Generate Reports, (6) Maintain Situational Awareness, and (7) Replan.  To support these activities,  NSC has produced a Battle Management Language, and has begun development of a Commander's Intent Language.To support research of CDM approaches, the NSC has been involved with the MACE program (Military Art of Command Environment), whose purpose is to establish a rapid prototyping, simulation environment for the experimentation and testing of innovative command decision modeling concepts.  Discussion:By itself, this is not an IO tool, but rather would be a helpful adjunct to an analysis of IO impact upon commanders' decision processes.  Careful requirements development would need to precede such integration regarding what particular IO operations/techniques are to be investigated and what specific metrics the analysis hopes to derive.Network-Centric, Info-Enabled Operations - Mr. David Noble, Evidence Based Research (EBR)Presentation:This is a research project to seek understanding of organizational and behavioral consequences of information-enabled network centric architectures, in terms of organizations (e.g., span of control, number of echelons, degree of centralization, self-synchronization) and behavioral dynamics (e.g., speed of response, oscillations).  The effort builds upon existing agent frameworks developed in the U.K..  Key properties of such network-centric operations are a shared understanding of the situation, plan and the Commander's intent.  The research aims to identify "emergent behaviors," which are new group behaviors that may be  observed which are not simple extensions of the behaviors of the units which compose the group, but rather, are non-linear extensions.Discussion:Similar to the C2WARS and CDM efforts, this effort provides a look at a variety of behavioral characteristics that impact command decisions.  By itself, this effort does not provide an IO M&S tool, but could play an integral role in the development of such a tool should it provide the required command decision effects at the level of resolution which may be deemed necessary. Information Superiority Army Experimentation Campaign Plan: IO Training & Assessment Requirements - Fred Teaford, TRADOC, Ft. Monroe, VA.Presentation:The mission of this effort is to, "... totally integrate information superiority into the Army's Experimentation Campaign Plan (AECP)."   The initial discussion describes changes underway within the U.S. Army to modify the Division and Corps organizational structures to include staff dedicated to the IO role.  In support of AECP military training events, the Army is developing an "IO Guidebook" to describe IO-related tasks and activities which might be exercised during the events.  This Guidebook hopes to provide, "Rewards for effective execution of IO and penalties for not."  It presents a common framework for planning, integrating and assessing IO effects, and defines measures of effectiveness (MOEs) and measures of performance (MOPs) for each effect.Discussion:This taxonomy of MOEs/MOPs related to specific IO effects is an important effort that should provide a useful basis for further discussion and promulgation of future IO M&S tools.  Depending on the actual analysis objectives for a specific tool, these metrics may differ, but this effort provides a valuable starting point for future discussions and developments.Land Information Warfare Activity (LIWA) IO M&S Efforts - MAJ Glenn Connor,  LIWAPresentation:LIWA's overall mission is to, "... integrate Information Operations into the Total Army.  They support the Warfighter in planning, synchronizing and executing Information Operations for the commander.  Concurrently, LIWA enhances Total Army force protection through a proactive defense."  As such, LIWA provides Field Support Teams (FSTs), Army Computer Emergency Response Teams (ACERTs) and IO Vulnerability Assessment Teams (IOVATs) to organizations across the Army in support of this IO mission.In a supporting role, the M&S mission of LIWA is to, "provide modeling and simulation support to LIWA to facilitate the planning, synchronization, and execution of Information Operations, (and to)  assist in the development and integration of IO requirements for Army models and simulations."The M&S branch of LIWA develops IO requirements for LIWA, Army, and Joint models and simulations, and is analyzing existing systems for potential IO applications.  Current tools in the LIWA M&S lab are the following:AMBISS (Automated Map Based Intelligence Support System) ADVERSARYSPECTRUMNARC (Network Analysis for Radio Communications) HYDRAAdditionally, the LIWA M&S Branch has worked to develop detailed requirements for Joint Simulation System (JSIMS) and the Advanced Regional Exploratory System (ARES), and has coordinated with DCSOPS and STRICOM to develop requirements for an IO Mission Planning, Rehearsal, and Execution Support System (IMPRESS).Discussion:LIWA appears to have one of the more diverse knowledge bases of existing IO-related tools and their respective application areas, with emphasis being on analytic, mission-level tools.AWARS - Army Warfighting Simulation IO Rqmts - Terry Gach, TRAC Leavenworth, KSPresentation:The U.S. Army at TRAC Leavenworth currently runs two models,  Vector in Commander (VIC) and EAGLE, for Corps-level analysis.  The best of both of these models is being combined into AWARS.  The AWARS objective is to represent a combined arms operation at the corps level with unit resolution at battalion (and lower) echelons.  Furthermore, AWARS aims to add more detail to the current VIC algorithms which explicitly represent the collection, processing and dissemination of information, as well as the Commanders' perception of the battlespace derived from this information.  The goal is to enable AWARS to produce metrics that show the contribution of information and information processes to combat outcomes.Discussion:This effort should provide insights into the causal effect of the presence or lack of information upon battle outcomes.  It is unclear to what level of detail it will leverage the various other commander decision modeling efforts described at this meeting.AF Materiel Command's  IO Planning System (IOPS) - LtCol Brad Bigelow, USAF Information Operations Directorate, Cryptologic Systems GroupPresentation:The objective of the IOPS program is to provide a set of tools for analyzing (e.g., what/how to attack and what will be the effects) and planning (e.g., tasking / coordination / C2 / Campaign / mission level integration) information operations.  Central to the IOPS program is the development of the IO Planning Tool (IOPT), which currently consists of the following:Integrated Many-on-Many model (IMOM)Static OPNET model - used to optimize jammer positions against C2 networks.It was acknowledged that the USAF has considerable historical experience dropping bombs on targets, and therefore can model that process very well.  In contrast, though, it was also acknowledged that  IO/IW is very new, and until large amounts of data are collected regarding how it effects battles,  USAF M&S tools will have less than desired capability levels.  It was concluded that perhaps the biggest deficiency in the development of appropriate IO M&S tools is the lack of data/analysis to integrate real world phenomena (cause and effect) into M&S tools.Discussion:It is acknowledged that a detailed understanding of the specific requirements, metrics and supporting methodologies to achieve the IOPS goals are not yet in hand. Operations Research, Modeling and Simulation at the National Security Agency (NSA) - Keith Bruso and CPT Buckshaw, NSAPresentation:In general, M&S activities at NSA focus on support to national Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) architecture and Unified Cryptologic Architecture (UCA) analyses and training.  IO M&S is one of four specific M&S focus areas within NSA.  The other three are (1) Effectiveness Analyses, (2) Exercise and Training Support and (3) and UCA and NSA Operations Research (OR) support.  The NSA IO M&S mission relates to both defensive and offensive IO, focusing efforts on decision analysis and network reconstruction.  NSA provides technical consultancy, research and product/prototype development.  Among its various IO M&S activities are the following:Risk Assessment Model (RAM):  Provides a functional decomposition of a problem that uses event trees. This analytic methodology enables analysis of risk for decision trade-offs, allows for sensitivity analysis and identifies the weak links of a system.Generalized Communications Assessment Tool (GCAT): Based on GAMS, ARCVIEW and OPNET, provides a network reconstruction and analysis capabilityNetwork Algorithm Repository Tool (NART):  Provides a tool, or environment, that allows for the design, expansion and implementation of new network technology models and innovative network algorithms (e.g., denial of service, path preservation and herding).Situational Influence Assessment Module (SIAM): A COTS product that NSA contributed to the development of, that is similar to C2WARS but not at as detailed a level of data;  the actual government proponent is the Joint Warfare Analysis Center (JWAC).Discussion:NSA possesses considerable expertise in the development of OR applications to investigate very detailed IO-related issues.  The focus seems to be on system-level and/or architecture-level communications issues, as opposed to the other activities discussed at this meeting which dealt predominantly with commander decision/behavioral modeling and mission-level effects.ConclusionBoth the IATAC report of over two years ago as well as the more recent Army workshop on IO M&S tools seem to support the thesis that the field of IO M&S is in its infancy, much as the world of Command and Control (C2) M&S was in the early 1980's.  Historically speaking, in the world of military operations research, one  can model well that which one  can define in detail, and that with which we have a long and robust history of collecting performance data.  IO does not fall into this category as it is so new to US forces' arsenal, and as such, IO M&S tools must often rely on educated guesses at how IO actions will impact an adversary.It is also apparent that the true overarching net effects of IO actions taken against an adversary are difficult to quantify in the real world, let alone to describe in a set of interrelated equations that can be codified in software.  Such effects are not simply physics-based equations of cause/effect, but must take into account the human behavioral effects of how actions are perceived by the adversary, how they shape his perception of the battlespace, and how this perception may cause the adversary to take various alternative courses of action.  Several IO M&S tools attempt to make this set of "connections," each taking into account different sets of factors, with varying degrees of fidelity.Both activities described in this report point to a need for a commonly agreed taxonomy of IO.  Furthermore, the following overarching issues were clearly surfaced: Need to recognize that several such taxonomies have been developed by different organizations, to different levels of detail, with perhaps different structures and definitions.  The challenge is not to invent a taxonomy, but perhaps to solicit, vet, modify and seek agreement on a common taxonomy.Need to recognize that the development of a taxonomy will require more than just a hierarchy of IO mission areas and sub-mission areas.  What will also be needed are definition and agreement of:Measures of Performance/Effectiveness for each sub-mission area that describe how to assess the degree to which IO actions have been successfulSome body of science that can be vetted and agreed to by the community that attempts to develop algorithmic representations of IO actions vs. impacts.  In the absence of this, the set of tools briefed presents a variety of approaches, any one of which may be valid for its own specific purpose, but may not be valid if extended to other analytic investigations.A common syntax/dictionary of IO termsAuthoritative data sources to quantify IO actions versus impacts.ReferencesJoint Publication 3-13.IATAC Critical Review & Technology Assessment Report: Modeling and Simulation Activities in Support of Information Assurance,"  IATAC TR-97-002, December 1, 1997.Author BiographiesGARY L.
